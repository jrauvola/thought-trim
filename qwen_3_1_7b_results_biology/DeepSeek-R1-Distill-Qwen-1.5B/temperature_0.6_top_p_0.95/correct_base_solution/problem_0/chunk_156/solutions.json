    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that's different.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that's different. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't align with what I've calculated. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check. Each bird has two traits, so the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C only \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. B only \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo if we assume a large population, say 16 birds, we'd expect 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, 1 D. But looking at the options, none exactly match this. However, let's look at option J, which says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That also doesn't fit. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems odd because if neither has the trait, that shouldn't happen unless both are recessive. Wait, but according to our calculations, Phenotype D is neither, which is 1/16, so in a group of 16, it's 1 bird. But in the options, the numbers don't seem to add up. Perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Wait, going back, the problem statement says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, but checkered is determined by the recessive allele, so checkered is when both alleles are recessive (cc). But in the question, the checkered pattern is described by the recessive allele, so that's correct. Similarly, the plain color is determined by the dominant allele B. Wait, no\u2014the problem says \"red\" is determined by the dominant allele C, and \"checkered\" is determined by the recessive allele c. So that's consistent with the standard Mendelian terms. Wait, but in the initial description, the birds are called \"pigeons,\" which might have different terminology. Anyway, moving forward. Let me re-examine the options. The correct answer should reflect the probabilities we calculated: 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking at the options, none of them seem to match this. However, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches the reverse of our calculation, assigning checkered to the red trait and plain to the brown trait. Wait, but in the problem statement, red is dominant over plain, and checkered is recessive. So red and checkered are both red, while plain and brown are both brown. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant traits. So checkered (c) is recessive, so birds with at least one c will be checkered. Plain (B) is dominant, so birds with at least one B will be plain. Wait, no\u2014the problem says \"red\" is dominant, and \"checkered\" is recessive. So red is dominant (C), checkered is recessive (c). Therefore, checkered is determined by the recessive allele, so any bird with a recessive allele (c) in the checkered position will be checkered. Similarly, red is dominant, so any bird with a dominant allele (C) will be red. Wait, but the problem describes the color as \"red\" (dominant) and \"checkered\" (recessive), so that's correct. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: Presence of recessive allele (c) in the checkered position and dominant (C) in the pigment position.\n- Checkered brown: Presence of recessive allele (c) and dominant (B) in pigment.\n- Plain red: Presence of dominant (C) and recessive (c) in pigment, and recessive (c) in checkered.\n- Plain brown: Presence of dominant (C) and dominant (B), plus recessive (c) in checkered.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: (1/4 chance for c in pigment) * (1/4 chance for c in checkered) = 1/16\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. So the probability that a bird has recessive c in pigment (to be checkered) and recessive c in checkered (to be plain) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that a bird has recessive c in pigment (checkered) and dominant B in pigment (red) is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nSame logic applies to checkered brown and plain red. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16 of the population\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nNow, looking at the options, none directly match this. However, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12 birds, which is less than the assumed 16. Alternatively, option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That sums to 16. Wait, 5+3+2+6=16. But according to our calculation, checkered red should be 1/16, which would be approximately 1 bird in 16. So option H has 5 checkered red, which is 5/16, which doesn't align. Alternatively, option E has 3 checkered red, which is 3/16, but that's inconsistent with our earlier thought that checkered is recessive. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one recessive allele (c) in the checkered position, it's checkered. But in reality, the checkered trait is determined by the recessive allele, so any bird with a recessive allele in the checkered position will be checkered. But in the problem statement, the checkered color is determined by the recessive allele, so the presence of a recessive allele (c) in the checkered position results in checkered color, and the presence of a dominant allele (C) results in red color. Wait, but the problem says \"red\" is dominant, and \"checkered\" is recessive. So, checkered is determined by the recessive allele, and red is dominant. Therefore, any bird with a recessive allele in the checkered position will be checkered, and red will be expressed if at least one dominant allele is present. Similarly, for the pigment color: any bird with a dominant allele (B) will be brown, and only those with a recessive (b) will be plain. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one recessive allele (c) in checkered (so c) AND at least one dominant allele (B) in pigment (so B).\n- Checkered brown: At least one recessive allele (c) in checkered AND dominant (B) in pigment.\n- Plain red: At least one dominant allele (C) in pigment AND at least one recessive (c) in checkered.\n- Plain brown: All dominant alleles in both genes.\n\nThus, the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: (prob of at least one c in checkered) * (prob of at least one B in pigment) \n= (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: (prob of at least one c in checkered) * (prob of at least one B in pigment)\n= 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\nWait, that can't be right because 9/16 + 9/16 would already exceed 1. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Instead, let's approach it correctly:\n\nFor the checkered trait, the probability of at least one c (i.e., recessive) is 3/4. For the pigment trait, the probability of at least one B (dominant) is 3/4. Since the traits are independent, the combined probability for checkered red is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, checkered brown is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, adding these together would give 18/16, which is more than 1. That's impossible, so clearly I'm misunderstanding the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nEach bird has two independent traits, each determined by one gene. The probability that a bird has checkered (c) in checkered and red (B) in pigment is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Similarly, the probability of checkered (c) in checkered and blue (b) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. The probability of plain (C) in pigment and checkered (c) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. And the probability of plain (C) in pigment and plain (c) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nAdding these up: 3 + 1 + 3 + 9 = 16 parts, which accounts for the entire population. Therefore, the expected phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/16\n- Checkered brown: 1/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 9/16\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. However, option H has checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Adding these gives 16, which is the denominator. But according to our calculation, checkered red should be 3, checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 9. None of the options match perfectly. However, option H's counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 5\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 6\n\nThis totals 16, which matches the expected distribution. However, according to our calculation, the expected counts should be multiples of 3 and 1. Option H assigns 5, 3, 2, and 6, which do not align with the expected ratios. Therefore, option H does not match the theoretical expectation. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the probabilities. Let me try again. Each gene is independent, so the probability that a bird has at least one recessive allele (c) in checkered is 3/4, and the probability of at least one dominant allele (B) in pigment is also 3/4. Therefore, the probability of checkered red (at least one c and at least one B) is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Similarly, checkered brown is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Plain red is 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16. Plain brown is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. So the expected counts are 9, 3, 3, 1. But since we're dealing with a large population, these become approximate. \n\nLooking at the options again, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This adds up to 12, which doesn't match. Option H adds to 16 but uses different numbers. Option E has 3, 9, 1, 3, which seems inverted. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems off because it places more plain red birds than expected. Option A and B suggest different distributions. Option C has checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which doesn't align with our probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how the traits are assigned in the options. In the problem statement, checkered is determined by the recessive allele (c), and plain by the dominant (C). Therefore, a bird is:\n\n- Checkered red: c and B \u2192 count towards checkered red\n- Checkered brown: c and b \u2192 count towards checkered brown\n- Plain red: C and c \u2192 count towards plain red\n- Plain brown: C and C \u2192 count towards plain brown\n\nGiven that, the expected counts should be proportional to the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 \u2248 1 bird (if 16 total)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 \u2248 0.1875 birds (\u22481 bird)\n- Plain red: 3/16 \u2248 0.1875 birds (\u22481 bird)\n- Plain brown: 1/16 \u2248 0.0625 birds (\u22481 bird)\n\nBut none of the options reflect exact 1s except option E, which has 3 checkered red and 9 checkered brown, which doesn't match. Option H has 5, 3, 2, and 6, which sum to 16 but doesn't follow the 3:1 ratio. Option J has 3, 9, 1, 3, which is the inverse of our expectations. Option A has 6, 2, 6, 2, which is also mismatched. Option B has 6, 2, 6, 2, same issue. Option C has 9, 3, 3, 1, which fits our 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's for a dihybrid cross, not a F2 cross. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which seems like a trihybrid, but we're dealing with a dihybrid cross. \n\nWait, now I'm confused. In a dihybrid cross, the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But none of the options directly state this. However, option E has 3, 9, 1, 3, which is the reverse. Option H has 5, 3, 2, 6, which sums to 16 but doesn't follow the 3:1 ratio. Option J has 3,9,1,3, which is the same as option E. Option I has 7,5,1,3, which sums to 16 but doesn't fit. Option F has 4,4,4,4, which doesn't fit either. Option G has 12,2,2,0, which doesn't make sense. Option C has 9,3,3,1, which is the 9:3:3:1 ratio but presented differently. Wait, in the options, option C is labeled as \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, in the F2 generation, we're dealing with a dihybrid cross, so the expected phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back at the options, the user listed options as A through J, with option C labeled as \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" So that matches our calculation. However, the user's initial question mentions that the options are numbered A to J, but the final answer should be boxed and matched against the options. \n\nWait, but in the initial prompt, the user provided multiple-choice answers with labels A to J, and the options were presented with the answer choices as A to J, each with a different ratio. However, upon reviewing, I realize that the user may have intended to list the options numerically, such as option A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2, etc. But in the provided query, the options are labeled A to J, each with a different numerical assignment.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's different. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't align with what I've calculated. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check. Each bird has two traits, so the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C only \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. B only \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo if we assume a large population, say 16 birds, we'd expect 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, 1 D. But looking at the options, none exactly match this. However, let's look at option J, which says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That also doesn't fit. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems odd because if neither has the trait, that shouldn't happen unless both are recessive. Wait, but according to our calculations, Phenotype D is neither, which is 1/16, so in a group of 16, it's 1 bird. But in the options, the numbers don't seem to add up. Perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Wait, going back, the problem statement says: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Wait, but checkered is determined by the recessive allele, so checkered is when both alleles are recessive (cc). But in the question, the checkered pattern is described by the recessive allele, so that's correct. Similarly, the plain color is determined by the dominant allele B. Wait, no\u2014the problem says \"red\" is determined by the dominant allele C, and \"checkered\" is determined by the recessive allele c. So that's consistent with the standard Mendelian terms. Wait, but in the initial description, the birds are called \"pigeons,\" which might have different terminology. Anyway, moving forward. Let me re-examine the options. The correct answer should reflect the probabilities we calculated: 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking at the options, none of them seem to match this. However, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches the reverse of our calculation, assigning checkered to the red trait and plain to the brown trait. Wait, but in the problem statement, red is dominant over plain, and checkered is recessive. So red and checkered are both red, while plain and brown are both brown. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant traits. So checkered (c) is recessive, so birds with at least one c will be checkered. Plain (B) is dominant, so birds with at least one B will be plain. Wait, no\u2014the problem says \"red\" is dominant, and \"checkered\" is recessive. So red is dominant (C), checkered is recessive (c). Therefore, checkered is determined by the recessive allele, so any bird with a recessive allele (c) in the checkered position will be checkered. Similarly, red is dominant, so any bird with a dominant allele (C) will be red. Wait, but the problem describes the color as \"red\" (dominant) and \"checkered\" (recessive), so that's correct. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: Presence of recessive allele (c) in the checkered position and dominant (C) in the pigment position.\n- Checkered brown: Presence of recessive allele (c) and dominant (B) in pigment.\n- Plain red: Presence of dominant (C) and recessive (c) in pigment, and recessive (c) in checkered.\n- Plain brown: Presence of dominant (C) and dominant (B), plus recessive (c) in checkered.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: (1/4 chance for c in pigment) * (1/4 chance for c in checkered) = 1/16\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. So the probability that a bird has recessive c in pigment (to be checkered) and recessive c in checkered (to be plain) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that a bird has recessive c in pigment (checkered) and dominant B in pigment (red) is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nSame logic applies to checkered brown and plain red. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1/16 of the population\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nNow, looking at the options, none directly match this. However, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12 birds, which is less than the assumed 16. Alternatively, option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That sums to 16. Wait, 5+3+2+6=16. But according to our calculation, checkered red should be 1/16, which would be approximately 1 bird in 16. So option H has 5 checkered red, which is 5/16, which doesn't align. Alternatively, option E has 3 checkered red, which is 3/16, but that's inconsistent with our earlier thought that checkered is recessive. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one recessive allele (c) in the checkered position, it's checkered. But in reality, the checkered trait is determined by the recessive allele, so any bird with a recessive allele in the checkered position will be checkered. But in the problem statement, the checkered color is determined by the recessive allele, so the presence of a recessive allele (c) in the checkered position results in checkered color, and the presence of a dominant allele (C) results in red color. Wait, but the problem says \"red\" is dominant, and \"checkered\" is recessive. So, checkered is determined by the recessive allele, and red is dominant. Therefore, any bird with a recessive allele in the checkered position will be checkered, and red will be expressed if at least one dominant allele is present. Similarly, for the pigment color: any bird with a dominant allele (B) will be brown, and only those with a recessive (b) will be plain. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: At least one recessive allele (c) in checkered (so c) AND at least one dominant allele (B) in pigment (so B).\n- Checkered brown: At least one recessive allele (c) in checkered AND dominant (B) in pigment.\n- Plain red: At least one dominant allele (C) in pigment AND at least one recessive (c) in checkered.\n- Plain brown: All dominant alleles in both genes.\n\nThus, the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: (prob of at least one c in checkered) * (prob of at least one B in pigment) \n= (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: (prob of at least one c in checkered) * (prob of at least one B in pigment)\n= 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\nWait, that can't be right because 9/16 + 9/16 would already exceed 1. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here. Instead, let's approach it correctly:\n\nFor the checkered trait, the probability of at least one c (i.e., recessive) is 3/4. For the pigment trait, the probability of at least one B (dominant) is 3/4. Since the traits are independent, the combined probability for checkered red is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Similarly, checkered brown is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, adding these together would give 18/16, which is more than 1. That's impossible, so clearly I'm misunderstanding the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nEach bird has two independent traits, each determined by one gene. The probability that a bird has checkered (c) in checkered and red (B) in pigment is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. Similarly, the probability of checkered (c) in checkered and blue (b) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. The probability of plain (C) in pigment and checkered (c) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. And the probability of plain (C) in pigment and plain (c) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nAdding these up: 3 + 1 + 3 + 9 = 16 parts, which accounts for the entire population. Therefore, the expected phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/16\n- Checkered brown: 1/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 9/16\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. However, option H has checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Adding these gives 16, which is the denominator. But according to our calculation, checkered red should be 3, checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 9. None of the options match perfectly. However, option H's counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 5\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 6\n\nThis totals 16, which matches the expected distribution. However, according to our calculation, the expected counts should be multiples of 3 and 1. Option H assigns 5, 3, 2, and 6, which do not align with the expected ratios. Therefore, option H does not match the theoretical expectation. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the probabilities. Let me try again. Each gene is independent, so the probability that a bird has at least one recessive allele (c) in checkered is 3/4, and the probability of at least one dominant allele (B) in pigment is also 3/4. Therefore, the probability of checkered red (at least one c and at least one B) is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16. Similarly, checkered brown is 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16. Plain red is 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16. Plain brown is 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16. So the expected counts are 9, 3, 3, 1. But since we're dealing with a large population, these become approximate. \n\nLooking at the options again, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This adds up to 12, which doesn't match. Option H adds to 16 but uses different numbers. Option E has 3, 9, 1, 3, which seems inverted. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems off because it places more plain red birds than expected. Option A and B suggest different distributions. Option C has checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which doesn't align with our probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how the traits are assigned in the options. In the problem statement, checkered is determined by the recessive allele (c), and plain by the dominant (C). Therefore, a bird is:\n\n- Checkered red: c and B \u2192 count towards checkered red\n- Checkered brown: c and b \u2192 count towards checkered brown\n- Plain red: C and c \u2192 count towards plain red\n- Plain brown: C and C \u2192 count towards plain brown\n\nGiven that, the expected counts should be proportional to the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 \u2248 1 bird (if 16 total)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 \u2248 0.1875 birds (\u22481 bird)\n- Plain red: 3/16 \u2248 0.1875 birds (\u22481 bird)\n- Plain brown: 1/16 \u2248 0.0625 birds (\u22481 bird)\n\nBut none of the options reflect exact 1s except option E, which has 3 checkered red and 9 checkered brown, which doesn't match. Option H has 5, 3, 2, and 6, which sum to 16 but doesn't follow the 3:1 ratio. Option J has 3, 9, 1, 3, which is the inverse of our expectations. Option A has 6, 2, 6, 2, which is also mismatched. Option B has 6, 2, 6, 2, same issue. Option C has 9, 3, 3, 1, which fits our 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's for a dihybrid cross, not a F2 cross. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which seems like a trihybrid, but we're dealing with a dihybrid cross. \n\nWait, now I'm confused. In a dihybrid cross, the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But none of the options directly state this. However, option E has 3, 9, 1, 3, which is the reverse. Option H has 5, 3, 2, 6, which sums to 16 but doesn't follow the 3:1 ratio. Option J has 3,9,1,3, which is the same as option E. Option I has 7,5,1,3, which sums to 16 but doesn't fit. Option F has 4,4,4,4, which doesn't fit either. Option G has 12,2,2,0, which doesn't make sense. Option C has 9,3,3,1, which is the 9:3:3:1 ratio but presented differently. Wait, in the options, option C is labeled as \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, in the F2 generation, we're dealing with a dihybrid cross, so the expected phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back at the options, the user listed options as A through J, with option C labeled as \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" So that matches our calculation. However, the user's initial question mentions that the options are numbered A to J, but the final answer should be boxed and matched against the options. \n\nWait, but in the initial prompt, the user provided multiple-choice answers with labels A to J, and the options were presented with the answer choices as A to J, each with a different ratio. However, upon reviewing, I realize that the user may have intended to list the options numerically, such as option A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2, etc. But in the provided query, the options are labeled A to J, each with a different numerical assignment. However, the user's instruction was to provide the final answer within </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Option E matches our calculation: 1 part plain-red, 3 plain-brown, 3 checkered-red, 9 checkered-brown.",
    "rollout": " Option E matches our calculation: 1 part plain-red, 3 plain-brown, 3 checkered-red, 9 checkered-brown. But wait, in our earlier analysis, the phenotypic ratio was 9:3:3:1, meaning that the expected phenotypic distribution follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Let me confirm: Yes, in a dihybrid cross where both genes are independently assorting and both are codominant, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. This corresponds to the four phenotypes we identified: A, B, C, D. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices, option G states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which doesn't fit. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\u2014also doesn't match. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, no match. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Still no match. Option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Hmm, that's a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option D: 1,3,9,3. Wait, that's 1:3:9:3, which is different. Option C: 1,2,2,2\u2014which also doesn't match. Option E: 3,9,1,3\u2014which fits our 1:3:9:3 ratio but inverted. Our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options seem to match exactly. Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me go through it again.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): 9/16 of the population.\n2. Pigment red (C) and plain (not B): 3/16.\n3. Plain (not C) and brown (B): 3/16.\n4. Plain (not C) and plain (not B): 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which translates to 9 parts checkered red, 3 parts checkered brown, 3 parts plain red, and 1 part plain brown. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the answer choices perfectly reflect this, but option E has a similar structure: 3,9,1,3, which is the inverse. Wait, but in terms of phenotypic expression, do we count the number of birds with each phenotype, regardless of order? So option E lists: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio when reversed. But in reality, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning checkered red is the highest. So if option E's numbers are 3,9,1,3, that would correspond to the reverse ratio, making it incorrect unless we misinterpret the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratio in the order of checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, which would be 9,1,3,3. But none of the options have that. Wait, looking back, option J is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which doesn't add up correctly. Option F sums to 12 as well. Option H: 5,3,2,6. Sum is 16. Option I: 7,5,1,3. Sum is 16. Option G: 12,2,2,0. Doesn't add up. Option E: 3,9,1,3. That adds to 16. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is represented in option E as 3,9,1,3. So despite the order, it's the same ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Option E matches our calculation: 1 part plain-red, 3 plain-brown, 3 checkered-red, 9 checkered-brown. But wait, in our earlier analysis, the phenotypic ratio was 9:3:3:1, meaning that the expected phenotypic distribution follows a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Let me confirm: Yes, in a dihybrid cross where both genes are independently assorting and both are codominant, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. This corresponds to the four phenotypes we identified: A, B, C, D. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices, option G states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which doesn't fit. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\u2014also doesn't match. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, no match. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Still no match. Option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. Hmm, that's a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option D: 1,3,9,3. Wait, that's 1:3:9:3, which is different. Option C: 1,2,2,2\u2014which also doesn't match. Option E: 3,9,1,3\u2014which fits our 1:3:9:3 ratio but inverted. Our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options seem to match exactly. Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me go through it again.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): 9/16 of the population.\n2. Pigment red (C) and plain (not B): 3/16.\n3. Plain (not C) and brown (B): 3/16.\n4. Plain (not C) and plain (not B): 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which translates to 9 parts checkered red, 3 parts checkered brown, 3 parts plain red, and 1 part plain brown. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the answer choices perfectly reflect this, but option E has a similar structure: 3,9,1,3, which is the inverse. Wait, but in terms of phenotypic expression, do we count the number of birds with each phenotype, regardless of order? So option E lists: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio when reversed. But in reality, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning checkered red is the highest. So if option E's numbers are 3,9,1,3, that would correspond to the reverse ratio, making it incorrect unless we misinterpret the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratio in the order of checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, which would be 9,1,3,3. But none of the options have that. Wait, looking back, option J is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which doesn't add up correctly. Option F sums to 12 as well. Option H: 5,3,2,6. Sum is 16. Option I: 7,5,1,3. Sum is 16. Option G: 12,2,2,0. Doesn't add up. Option E: 3,9,1,3. That adds to 16. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is represented in option E as 3,9,1,3. So despite the order, it's the same ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that corresponds to Phenotypes D, B, A, C respectively.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that corresponds to Phenotypes D, B, A, C respectively.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me double-check. Option E says: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". Which aligns exactly with what I have: D(1), B(3), A(9), C(3). So the order in the options matters. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so the order should reflect the phenotypes in the order of the letters. So checkered red comes before checkered brown, which comes before plain red, which comes last. So option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that corresponds to Phenotypes D, B, A, C respectively. Because:\n\n- Phenotype D: 1 part \u2192 checkered (plain) and checkered \u2192 count 1\n- Phenotype B: 3 parts \u2192 checkered (plain) and red \u2192 count 3\n- Phenotype A: 9 parts \u2192 red and brown \u2192 count 9\n- Phenotype C: 3 parts \u2192 red and plain \u2192 count 3\n\nSo the ratio would be checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 1 : 3 : 9 : 3. Wait, but looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me double-check. Option E says: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". Which aligns exactly with what I have: D(1), B(3), A(9), C(3). So the order in the options matters. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so the order should reflect the phenotypes in the order of the letters. So checkered red comes before checkered brown, which comes before plain red, which comes last. So option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Yes, that fits perfectly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, according to our calculation, checkered red would be 1 part, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9. So option E matches this. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Yes, that aligns with our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Let me double-check. Wait, perhaps I messed up the mapping of the phenotypes. Let me re-express:\n\nPhenotype A: Checkered (c) and Brown (b) \u2192 1 part (plain and checkered)\nPhenotype B: Checkered (c) and Red (B) \u2192 3 parts (plain and red)\nPhenotype C: Red (C) and Brown (b) \u2192 9 parts (red and brown)\nPhenotype D: Red (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3 parts (plain and checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because in terms of the phenotypic ratios, it's often presented as the proportion of each phenotype relative to each other. Wait, looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to Phenotype D (plain and checkered) 1, B (plain and red) 3, A (red and brown) 9, and C (checkered and brown) 3. That matches exactly with our calculation: Phenotype D: 1, B:3, A:9, C:3. So the order in the answer choices matters because it's asking for the expected phenotypes in the F2 generation. The user listed the options as A through J, with each option giving a different phenotypic ratio. Based on our calculation, the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But wait, according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D, which is 1 part, but the options don't seem to align exactly.",
    "rollout": " But wait, according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D, which is 1 part, but the options don't seem to align exactly. Let me double-check. Wait, the options are:\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nIn our calculation, checkered red (Phenotype D) is 1 part, but none of the options match that. Instead, the options list \"plain\" as a phenotype, which corresponds to Phenotype C, which is 3 parts. So if we take the numbers as proportional to the parts, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 3\n- Checkered brown:9\n- Plain red:1\n- Plain brown:3\n\nWhich matches option E. However, the phrasing in option E says \"plain red 3, plain brown 9,\" which is inconsistent with our calculation. Because according to our analysis, checkered red is 1 part (plain brown?), wait no. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, earlier I thought Phenotype A was both traits present, which includes red and brown. But according to the options, checkered red is listed separately. Hmm, I think I may have confused the terminology. Let me re-examine the definitions. The question defines:\n\n- Red color (R): due to C\n- Brown color (B): due to B\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits:\n\n- Both R and B \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only R \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Only B \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nBut looking back at the options, they define:\n\n- Checkered red: plain and red (Phenotype B)\n- Checkered brown: plain and brown (Phenotype C)\n- Plain red: red and plain (Phenotype B)\n- Plain brown: brown and plain (Phenotype C)\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. So in reality, the definition is that:\n\n- Checkered red: both alleles for red are recessive (c), and at least one allele for brown is dominant (B). So it's plain (c) and red (C).\n- Checkered brown: both alleles for red are recessive (c), and both alleles for brown are recessive (b). So it's plain (c) and brown (b).\n- Plain red: both alleles for red are dominant (C), and both alleles for brown are recessive (b). So it's red (C) and plain (c).\n- Plain brown: both alleles for red are dominant (C), and at least one allele for brown is dominant (B). So it's red (C) and brown (B).\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype B (only R)\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype C (only B)\n- Plain red: Phenotype A (both R)\n- Plain brown: Phenotype D (both B)\n\nNow, recalculating the probabilities:\n\nEach bird has two independent traits. The probability of having only R (c) is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16. Only B is (1/4)(3/4)=3/16. Both R and B is (3/4)(3/4)=9/16. Neither is 1/16.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red (only R): 3/16\n- Checkered brown (only B): 3/16\n- Plain red (both R):9/16\n- Plain brown (both B):1/16\n\nSince the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, the options provided are:\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nBut according to our calculation, the numbers should be in the order of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, with counts proportional to 3,3,9,1 respectively. But none of the options perfectly match this. Option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, plain brown as 3. This is incorrect because our calculation shows checkered brown (only B) as 3 and plain red (both R) as 9. So the correct order should be checkered red (only R) : checkered brown (only B) : plain red (both R) : plain brown (both B). Translating to counts, it's 3:3:9:1. None of the options directly state this, but let's look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:6:2:2 \u2013 Not matching.\n\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2013 Doesn't include both R and B.\n\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 Not matching.\n\nD.1:3:9:3 \u2013 Doesn't fit.\n\nE.3:9:1:3 \u2013 Again, checkered red is 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This doesn't align with our findings because we have checkered brown (3) and plain red (9), but also checkered red (3) and plain brown (1). Wait, I think I misassigned the terms earlier. Let me clarify once again:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratios based on our calculations are:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/16\n\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n\n- Plain red:9/16\n\n- Plain brown:1/16\n\nTo convert these to whole numbers, multiply numerator by 16. So:\n\nCheckered red: 3\n\nCheckered brown:3\n\nPlain red:9\n\nPlain brown:1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:3:9:1. But looking at the options, none directly present this. However, option E presents 3:9:1:3, which is similar but inverted. Perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the order. Let me recount:\n\nTotal phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 3\n\n- Checkered brown:3\n\n- Plain red:9\n\n- Plain brown:1\n\nAdding these together: 3+3+9+1=16, which is correct as there are 16 possible combinations in F2.\n\nHowever, the options don't provide 3:3:9:1. The closest option is E, which lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as9, plain red as1, and plain brown as3. But that's inconsistent with our calculation, as plain red should be9 and plain brown1. Therefore, none of the options seem to match perfectly, but perhaps I've misunderstood the termings. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe question defines:\n\n- Checkered red: plain and red\n\n- Checkered brown: plain and brown\n\n- Plain red: red and plain\n\n- Plain brown: brown and plain\n\nWait, no! The question defines:\n\n- Checkered red: plain and red (so both alleles for red are recessive, and at least one for brown)\n\n- Checkered brown: plain and brown (both red alleles are recessive, and both brown alleles are recessive)\n\n- Plain red: red and plain (both red alleles are dominant, and both brown alleles are recessive)\n\n- Plain brown: brown and plain (both red alleles are dominant, and at least one brown allele is recessive)\n\nWait, that changes everything. Earlier, I incorrectly assigned the terms. According to the question's definitions:\n\n- Checkered red: both alleles for red are recessive (c), and at least one for brown is dominant (B). So it's plain (c) and red (C).\n\n- Checkered brown: both alleles for red are recessive (c), and both brown alleles are recessive (b). So it's plain (c) and brown (b).\n\n- Plain red: both alleles for red are dominant (C), and both brown alleles are recessive (b). So it's red (C) and plain (c).\n\n- Plain brown: both alleles for red are dominant (C), and at least one brown allele is recessive (b). So it's red (C) and brown (B).\n\nThis changes the entire analysis. Therefore, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype A (only R)\n\n- Checkered brown: both C and both B \u2192 Phenotype B (only B)\n\n- Plain red: both C and both b \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n- Plain brown: both C and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype D (both R and B)\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused again. Let me clearly map each bird's phenotype based on the question's definitions.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. Their genotype determines the phenotype as follows:\n\n- For C:\n   - CC or Cc \u2192 Pigmented red (R)\n   - cc \u2192 plain (not R)\n\n- For B:\n   - BB or Bb \u2192 Brown (B)\n   - bb \u2192 plain (not B)\n\nBut the phenotype is a combination of both traits. So:\n\n- If a bird has both R and B (i.e., C and B alleles are present), it is Phenotype A: red and brown.\n\n- If a bird has R but not B (C and b), it is Phenotype B: red and plain.\n\n- If a bird has B but not R (cc and B), it is Phenotype C: plain and brown.\n\n- If a bird has neither R nor B (cc and bb), it is Phenotype D: plain and plain.\n\nBut according to the question's definitions:\n\n- Checkered red is both R and at least one B \u2192 which would be Phenotype B (red and plain)\n\n- Checkered brown is both R and both B \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n\n- Plain red is both R and both b \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and red)\n\n- Plain brown is both R and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype D (red and brown)\n\nWait, that still conflicts with my previous understanding. I think the confusion arises from the exact wording of the question. Let me read it again:\n\nThe question defines:\n\n- Checkered red: plain and red (so both alleles for red are recessive (c), and at least one for brown is dominant (B))\n\n- Checkered brown: plain and brown (both alleles for red are recessive, and both alleles for brown are recessive)\n\n- Plain red: red and plain (both alleles for red are dominant (C), and both alleles for brown are recessive)\n\n- Plain brown: brown and plain (both alleles for red are dominant (C), and at least one allele for brown is recessive (b))\n\nAh, okay, so based on this, the correct mapping is:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype B (only R)\n\n- Checkered brown: both C and both B \u2192 Phenotype A (both R and B)\n\n- Plain red: both C and both b \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n- Plain brown: both C and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype D (both R and B)\n\nWait, now I'm completely confused. Let me try to create a table of all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes based on the correct definitions.\n\nPossible Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigmented red (R), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B (only R)\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 R, Brown \u2192 Phenotype B (only R)\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 R, plain \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n4. CC BB \u2192 same as 1\n\n5. CC Bb \u2192 same as 2\n\n6. CC bb \u2192 same as 3\n\n7. CC bb \u2192 same as 3\n\n8. Cc BB \u2192 R, B \u2192 Phenotype B (only R)\n\n9. Cc Bb \u2192 R, B \u2192 Phenotype B (only R)\n\n10. Cc bb \u2192 R, plain \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n11. cC BB \u2192 same as 8\n\n12. cC Bb \u2192 same as 9\n\n13. cC bb \u2192 same as 10\n\n14. cc BB \u2192 plain, B \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n15. cc Bb \u2192 plain, B \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n16. cc bb \u2192 plain, plain \u2192 Phenotype D (only R)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because cc is plain, and bb is plain, so cc bb should be plain and plain. But according to the definitions:\n\n- Plain brown is both R and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype D (both R and B)\n\n- Plain red is both R and both b \u2192 Phenotype C (both R and not B)\n\nWait, no. According to the question, plain brown is both R and both b, while plain red is both R and both b as well. Wait, that can't be right because B is brown and b is plain. Wait, no\u2014B is dominant for brown, so if an individual has at least one B, they have brown. If they have both B and b, that's impossible because you can't have both alleles for a trait in the same individual. So, the correct interpretation is:\n\n- An individual with genotype cc Bb has both R and brown (because they have at least one B), so Phenotype D (both R and B).\n\n- An individual with genotype cc bb has both R and plain (because they have both b alleles), so Phenotype C (both R and not B).\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- An individual with genotype CC bb has both R and plain (phenotype C), because they have both r alleles (assuming lowercase is for plain, uppercase for red).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the notation may vary. Let me assume that 'r' is for plain and 'R' is for red (uppercase), 'b' for plain ('b'), 'B' for brown ('B').\n\nThen:\n\n- Any individual with at least one 'B' has brown.\n\n- Any individual with at least one 'r' (lowercase) has plain.\n\nSo:\n\n- Phenotype A: both R and B (genotype RRBB)\n\n- Phenotype B: both R and b (genotype RRbb)\n\n- Phenotype C: both r and B (genotype rrBB)\n\n- Phenotype D: both r and b (genotype rrbb)\n\nThis makes sense. Now, applying this to the F2 generation:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which self-fertilizes. The possible gametes are:\n\n- CB (25%)\n\n- cb (25%)\n\n- cB (25%)\n\n- bc (25%)\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n\n- Cc: 50%\n\n- cc:25%\n\n- BB:25%\n\n- Bb:50%\n\n- bb:25%\n\nNow, we categorize each F2 genotype into the four phenotypes based on the rules above:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (RRBB)\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (RRbb)\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n4. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (RRBB)\n\n5. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (RRbb)\n\n6. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n7. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (RRBB)\n\n8. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype B (RRbb)\n\n9. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (RRbb)\n\n10. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n11. cC BB \u2192 Phenotype B (rrBB)\n\n12. cC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (rrBB)\n\n13. cC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n14. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n15. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n16. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D (rrbb)\n\nNow, count how many fall into each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: All individuals with CC and BB. From the 16 possible F2 genotypes, only the ones where both C is present and both B is present will be Phenotype A. Looking at the combinations:\n\nOnly the genotype CC BB will satisfy this. Additionally, any genotype where both C is present (CC or Cc) and B is present (BB or Bb) will be Phenotype A. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has CC and BB, it's Phenotype A. If it has CC and Bb, it's Phenotype B. If it has Cc and BB, it's Phenotype B. Only if it has CC and both B and b alleles (which is impossible because you can't have both B and b alleles), it can't be both R and B. Wait, no\u2014actually, in F2, the presence of both R and B depends on the combination of the two genes. So, Phenotype A is when both C and B are present, i.e., CC and BB, CC and Bb, Cc and BB, Cc and Bb. So that's 2 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 6 cases? Wait, no, because each gene is independent, so for each of the 4 possible combinations of the two genes, half the F2 will have each combination. Wait, no\u2014this is confusing. Let's instead count the number of F2 individuals for each phenotype.\n\nWait, in F2, each gene has 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc; similarly for B. So the possible genotypes are:\n\nNumber of each genotype:\n\n- CC: 25% of 16 = 4\n\n- Cc: 50% of 16 = 8\n\n- cc:25% of 16 =4\n\n- BB:25% of16=4\n\n- Bb:50% of16=8\n\n- bb:25% of16=4\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in dominant form. So, for each bird, if they have at least one R (C) and at least one B (B), they are Phenotype A (RRBB). If they have at least one R and at least one b (bb), they are Phenotype C (rrBB). If they have at least one c (cc) and at least one B, they are Phenotype B (RRbb). If they have at least one c and at least one b, they are Phenotype D (rrbb).\n\nSo, counting:\n\n- Phenotype A (RRBB): Only those who have both R and B. Looking at the gen",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But wait, according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D, which is 1 part, but the options don't seem to align exactly. Let me double-check. Wait, the options are:\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown.\n\nIn our calculation, checkered red (Phenotype D) is 1 part, but none of the options match that. Instead, the options list \"plain\" as a phenotype, which corresponds to Phenotype C, which is 3 parts. So if we take the numbers as proportional to the parts, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 3\n- Checkered brown:9\n- Plain red:1\n- Plain brown:3\n\nWhich matches option E. However, the phrasing in option E says \"plain red 3, plain brown 9,\" which is inconsistent with our calculation. Because according to our analysis, checkered red is 1 part (plain brown?), wait no. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, earlier I thought Phenotype A was both traits present, which includes red and brown. But according to the options, checkered red is listed separately. Hmm, I think I may have confused the terminology. Let me re-examine the definitions. The question defines:\n\n- Red color (R): due to C\n- Brown color (B): due to B\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits:\n\n- Both R and B \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only R \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Only B \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Neither \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nBut looking back at the options, they define:\n\n- Checkered red: plain and red (Phenotype B)\n- Checkered brown: plain and brown (Phenotype C)\n- Plain red: red and plain (Phenotype B)\n- Plain brown: brown and plain (Phenotype C)\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. So in reality, the definition is that:\n\n- Checkered red: both alleles for red are recessive (c), and at least one allele for brown is dominant (B). So it's plain (c) and red (C).\n- Checkered brown: both alleles for red are recessive (c), and both alleles for brown are recessive (b). So it's plain (c) and brown (b).\n- Plain red: both alleles for red are dominant (C), and both alleles for brown are recessive (b). So it's red (C) and plain (c).\n- Plain brown: both alleles for red are dominant (C), and at least one allele for brown is dominant (B). So it's red (C) and brown (B).\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype B (only R)\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype C (only B)\n- Plain red: Phenotype A (both R)\n- Plain brown: Phenotype D (both B)\n\nNow, recalculating the probabilities:\n\nEach bird has two independent traits. The probability of having only R (c) is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16. Only B is (1/4)(3/4)=3/16. Both R and B is (3/4)(3/4)=9/16. Neither is 1/16.\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red (only R): 3/16\n- Checkered brown (only B): 3/16\n- Plain red (both R):9/16\n- Plain brown (both B):1/16\n\nSince the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, the options provided are:\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nBut according to our calculation, the numbers should be in the order of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, with counts proportional to 3,3,9,1 respectively. But none of the options perfectly match this. Option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, plain brown as 3. This is incorrect because our calculation shows checkered brown (only B) as 3 and plain red (both R) as 9. So the correct order should be checkered red (only R) : checkered brown (only B) : plain red (both R) : plain brown (both B). Translating to counts, it's 3:3:9:1. None of the options directly state this, but let's look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:6:2:2 \u2013 Not matching.\n\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2013 Doesn't include both R and B.\n\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2013 Not matching.\n\nD.1:3:9:3 \u2013 Doesn't fit.\n\nE.3:9:1:3 \u2013 Again, checkered red is 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This doesn't align with our findings because we have checkered brown (3) and plain red (9), but also checkered red (3) and plain brown (1). Wait, I think I misassigned the terms earlier. Let me clarify once again:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratios based on our calculations are:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/16\n\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n\n- Plain red:9/16\n\n- Plain brown:1/16\n\nTo convert these to whole numbers, multiply numerator by 16. So:\n\nCheckered red: 3\n\nCheckered brown:3\n\nPlain red:9\n\nPlain brown:1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:3:9:1. But looking at the options, none directly present this. However, option E presents 3:9:1:3, which is similar but inverted. Perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the order. Let me recount:\n\nTotal phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 3\n\n- Checkered brown:3\n\n- Plain red:9\n\n- Plain brown:1\n\nAdding these together: 3+3+9+1=16, which is correct as there are 16 possible combinations in F2.\n\nHowever, the options don't provide 3:3:9:1. The closest option is E, which lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as9, plain red as1, and plain brown as3. But that's inconsistent with our calculation, as plain red should be9 and plain brown1. Therefore, none of the options seem to match perfectly, but perhaps I've misunderstood the termings. Let me check the original question again.\n\nThe question defines:\n\n- Checkered red: plain and red\n\n- Checkered brown: plain and brown\n\n- Plain red: red and plain\n\n- Plain brown: brown and plain\n\nWait, no! The question defines:\n\n- Checkered red: plain and red (so both alleles for red are recessive, and at least one for brown)\n\n- Checkered brown: plain and brown (both red alleles are recessive, and both brown alleles are recessive)\n\n- Plain red: red and plain (both red alleles are dominant, and both brown alleles are recessive)\n\n- Plain brown: brown and plain (both red alleles are dominant, and at least one brown allele is recessive)\n\nWait, that changes everything. Earlier, I incorrectly assigned the terms. According to the question's definitions:\n\n- Checkered red: both alleles for red are recessive (c), and at least one for brown is dominant (B). So it's plain (c) and red (C).\n\n- Checkered brown: both alleles for red are recessive (c), and both brown alleles are recessive (b). So it's plain (c) and brown (b).\n\n- Plain red: both alleles for red are dominant (C), and both brown alleles are recessive (b). So it's red (C) and plain (c).\n\n- Plain brown: both alleles for red are dominant (C), and at least one brown allele is recessive (b). So it's red (C) and brown (B).\n\nThis changes the entire analysis. Therefore, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype A (only R)\n\n- Checkered brown: both C and both B \u2192 Phenotype B (only B)\n\n- Plain red: both C and both b \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n- Plain brown: both C and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype D (both R and B)\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused again. Let me clearly map each bird's phenotype based on the question's definitions.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. Their genotype determines the phenotype as follows:\n\n- For C:\n   - CC or Cc \u2192 Pigmented red (R)\n   - cc \u2192 plain (not R)\n\n- For B:\n   - BB or Bb \u2192 Brown (B)\n   - bb \u2192 plain (not B)\n\nBut the phenotype is a combination of both traits. So:\n\n- If a bird has both R and B (i.e., C and B alleles are present), it is Phenotype A: red and brown.\n\n- If a bird has R but not B (C and b), it is Phenotype B: red and plain.\n\n- If a bird has B but not R (cc and B), it is Phenotype C: plain and brown.\n\n- If a bird has neither R nor B (cc and bb), it is Phenotype D: plain and plain.\n\nBut according to the question's definitions:\n\n- Checkered red is both R and at least one B \u2192 which would be Phenotype B (red and plain)\n\n- Checkered brown is both R and both B \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n\n- Plain red is both R and both b \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and red)\n\n- Plain brown is both R and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype D (red and brown)\n\nWait, that still conflicts with my previous understanding. I think the confusion arises from the exact wording of the question. Let me read it again:\n\nThe question defines:\n\n- Checkered red: plain and red (so both alleles for red are recessive (c), and at least one for brown is dominant (B))\n\n- Checkered brown: plain and brown (both alleles for red are recessive, and both alleles for brown are recessive)\n\n- Plain red: red and plain (both alleles for red are dominant (C), and both alleles for brown are recessive)\n\n- Plain brown: brown and plain (both alleles for red are dominant (C), and at least one allele for brown is recessive (b))\n\nAh, okay, so based on this, the correct mapping is:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype B (only R)\n\n- Checkered brown: both C and both B \u2192 Phenotype A (both R and B)\n\n- Plain red: both C and both b \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n- Plain brown: both C and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype D (both R and B)\n\nWait, now I'm completely confused. Let me try to create a table of all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes based on the correct definitions.\n\nPossible Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigmented red (R), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B (only R)\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 R, Brown \u2192 Phenotype B (only R)\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 R, plain \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n4. CC BB \u2192 same as 1\n\n5. CC Bb \u2192 same as 2\n\n6. CC bb \u2192 same as 3\n\n7. CC bb \u2192 same as 3\n\n8. Cc BB \u2192 R, B \u2192 Phenotype B (only R)\n\n9. Cc Bb \u2192 R, B \u2192 Phenotype B (only R)\n\n10. Cc bb \u2192 R, plain \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n11. cC BB \u2192 same as 8\n\n12. cC Bb \u2192 same as 9\n\n13. cC bb \u2192 same as 10\n\n14. cc BB \u2192 plain, B \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n15. cc Bb \u2192 plain, B \u2192 Phenotype C (only R)\n\n16. cc bb \u2192 plain, plain \u2192 Phenotype D (only R)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because cc is plain, and bb is plain, so cc bb should be plain and plain. But according to the definitions:\n\n- Plain brown is both R and at least one B \u2192 Phenotype D (both R and B)\n\n- Plain red is both R and both b \u2192 Phenotype C (both R and not B)\n\nWait, no. According to the question, plain brown is both R and both b, while plain red is both R and both b as well. Wait, that can't be right because B is brown and b is plain. Wait, no\u2014B is dominant for brown, so if an individual has at least one B, they have brown. If they have both B and b, that's impossible because you can't have both alleles for a trait in the same individual. So, the correct interpretation is:\n\n- An individual with genotype cc Bb has both R and brown (because they have at least one B), so Phenotype D (both R and B).\n\n- An individual with genotype cc bb has both R and plain (because they have both b alleles), so Phenotype C (both R and not B).\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- An individual with genotype CC bb has both R and plain (phenotype C), because they have both r alleles (assuming lowercase is for plain, uppercase for red).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the notation may vary. Let me assume that 'r' is for plain and 'R' is for red (uppercase), 'b' for plain ('b'), 'B' for brown ('B').\n\nThen:\n\n- Any individual with at least one 'B' has brown.\n\n- Any individual with at least one 'r' (lowercase) has plain.\n\nSo:\n\n- Phenotype A: both R and B (genotype RRBB)\n\n- Phenotype B: both R and b (genotype RRbb)\n\n- Phenotype C: both r and B (genotype rrBB)\n\n- Phenotype D: both r and b (genotype rrbb)\n\nThis makes sense. Now, applying this to the F2 generation:\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which self-fertilizes. The possible gametes are:\n\n- CB (25%)\n\n- cb (25%)\n\n- cB (25%)\n\n- bc (25%)\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n\n- Cc: 50%\n\n- cc:25%\n\n- BB:25%\n\n- Bb:50%\n\n- bb:25%\n\nNow, we categorize each F2 genotype into the four phenotypes based on the rules above:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (RRBB)\n\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (RRbb)\n\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n4. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (RRBB)\n\n5. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (RRbb)\n\n6. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n7. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (RRBB)\n\n8. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype B (RRbb)\n\n9. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (RRbb)\n\n10. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n11. cC BB \u2192 Phenotype B (rrBB)\n\n12. cC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (rrBB)\n\n13. cC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n14. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n15. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype C (rrBB)\n\n16. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D (rrbb)\n\nNow, count how many fall into each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: All individuals with CC and BB. From the 16 possible F2 genotypes, only the ones where both C is present and both B is present will be Phenotype A. Looking at the combinations:\n\nOnly the genotype CC BB will satisfy this. Additionally, any genotype where both C is present (CC or Cc) and B is present (BB or Bb) will be Phenotype A. Wait, no\u2014if a bird has CC and BB, it's Phenotype A. If it has CC and Bb, it's Phenotype B. If it has Cc and BB, it's Phenotype B. Only if it has CC and both B and b alleles (which is impossible because you can't have both B and b alleles), it can't be both R and B. Wait, no\u2014actually, in F2, the presence of both R and B depends on the combination of the two genes. So, Phenotype A is when both C and B are present, i.e., CC and BB, CC and Bb, Cc and BB, Cc and Bb. So that's 2 (for C) * 3 (for B) = 6 cases? Wait, no, because each gene is independent, so for each of the 4 possible combinations of the two genes, half the F2 will have each combination. Wait, no\u2014this is confusing. Let's instead count the number of F2 individuals for each phenotype.\n\nWait, in F2, each gene has 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc; similarly for B. So the possible genotypes are:\n\nNumber of each genotype:\n\n- CC: 25% of 16 = 4\n\n- Cc: 50% of 16 = 8\n\n- cc:25% of 16 =4\n\n- BB:25% of16=4\n\n- Bb:50% of16=8\n\n- bb:25% of16=4\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in dominant form. So, for each bird, if they have at least one R (C) and at least one B (B), they are Phenotype A (RRBB). If they have at least one R and at least one b (bb), they are Phenotype C (rrBB). If they have at least one c (cc) and at least one B, they are Phenotype B (RRbb). If they have at least one c and at least one b, they are Phenotype D (rrbb).\n\nSo, counting:\n\n- Phenotype A (RRBB): Only those who have both R and B. Looking at the gen",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that seems different.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that seems different. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to look at the dihybrid cross without considering the independence of the genes, but the question states that the genes are independent. Hmm. Let me try another approach. Using the Punnett square method for F2:\n\nF1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will include the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are a combination of these. Now, to find the phenotypes:\n\nFor each genotype, determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 combinations:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n3. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n4. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n5. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n6. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n7. Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n8. Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n9. Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n10. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n11. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n12. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n13. cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n14. cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n15. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n16. BB \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n17. BB \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n18. BB \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n19. BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n20. Bb \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n21. Bb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n22. Bb \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n23. Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n24. Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A (red and brown): All cases except when C is absent and B is absent. From above, the cases where both C and B are missing are when the bird is cc and bb. How many such cases? Looking at the list, there are 4 instances where the bird is cc (cases 7, 13, 19, 23) and BB (case 20). So total of 8 cases where the bird is cc or BB? Wait, no, each bird can only be one type. So looking at the list:\n\nPhenotype A occurs in:\n\nCases 1-6 (all CC combinations) \u2192 6 cases\nCases 8-12 (Cc \u00d7 anything) \u2192 7 cases (including 8,9,10,11,12)\nCases 14-24 (all BB combinations) \u2192 11 cases\nTotal: 6 + 7 + 11 = 24 cases\n\nPhenotype B (red and checkered): Occurs in cases where C is present but B is absent. These occur in cases 2,3,4,17,18,21,22,24. That's 8 cases.\n\nPhenotype C (plain and brown): Occurs in cases where B is present but C is absent. These are cases 5,6,10,11,15,16,20,23. That's also 8 cases.\n\nPhenotype D (plain and checkered): Occurs in cases where both C and B are absent. Cases 15,16,17,18,19,20,24 \u2192 Wait, no, looking back: Cases where the bird is cc and bb are cases 15,16,17,18,19,20,23,24. Wait, let's recount:\n\nLooking through the list, the cases where the bird is plain and checkered are:\n\nCase 15: cc \u00d7 cc\nCase 16: cc \u00d7 bb\nCase 17: cc \u00d7 BB\nCase 18: BB \u00d7 cc\nCase 19: BB \u00d7 BB\nCase 20: BB \u00d7 CC\nCase 21: Bb \u00d7 cc\nCase 22: Bb \u00d7 cc\nCase 23: Bb \u00d7 cc\nCase 24: Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nThat's 10 cases? Wait, no, looking at the list, each bird can only be one type. So in reality, the number of birds that are plain and checkered is the number of times the bird is cc and bb. From the list:\n\nOnly case 15 is cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 plain and checkered.\nOther cases where the bird is cc and something else don't count because each bird is unique. Wait, no, each bird is represented once in the list, so the number of birds that are plain and checkered is the number of cases where both C and B are absent. Which is only case 15. Similarly, case 16 is cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 plain and checkered. Case 17 is cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 still plain and checkered. Cases 18-24 involve B present, so only cases 15 and 16 are plain and checkered. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is cc and bb, it's one bird. If it's cc and BB, it's another bird. So in the list, how many times does the bird have cc and bb? Only case 15. Similarly, case 16 has cc and bb, making two birds: 15 and 16. Cases 17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 involve at least one B, so they are either red and brown or red and checkered. Therefore, only cases 15 and 16 are plain and checkered. So Phenotype D occurs in 2 cases. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought Phenotype D was 1 part, but now I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine. Earlier, I had:\n\nPhenotype A: 24 cases\nPhenotype B: 8 cases\nPhenotype C: 8 cases\nPhenotype D: ?\n\nBut according to the list, Phenotype A is 24, B is 8, C is 8, and D is 2. Adding these together, 24+8+8+2=42. But the total number of F2 individuals is 2^4=16. Wait, that's impossible because 16 birds cannot produce 42 F2 offspring. Clearly, I'm misunderstanding the calculation. Instead, the correct approach is to realize that each F2 bird is produced by a combination of gametes, and thus each bird is represented once in the Punnett square. Therefore, the total number of F2 birds is (number of possible gametes)^2. Since each parent contributes 4 gametes, the F2 has 16 birds. Therefore, the total number of F2 offspring is 16. My previous breakdown was incorrect because I miscounted the cases.\n\nLet me redo the count correctly:\n\nEach F2 bird is represented once in the Punnett square. So for each combination of gametes from F1 (CcBb) crossed with F1 (CcBb), the resulting bird is one of the 16 possible combinations. Let's enumerate all possible combinations:\n\nGamete 1: CB\nGamete 2: cb\n\nResulting bird: CcBb\n\nSimilarly, other combinations lead to various genotypes. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Let's go through each possible combination:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n3. CB \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n4. CB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n5.

Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n\nNow, let's categorize each bird:\n\n- Phenotype A (red and brown): Cases 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 \u2192 Total of 24 cases\n- Phenotype B (red and checkered): Cases where C is present (CB or cb) but B is absent (BB, Bb, bb). Looking through the list, Phenotype B occurs in cases where the bird is C present and B absent. This happens in cases 10,11,15,16,20,21,25,26,27,28,29,30 \u2192 Wait, no, looking back, Phenotype B is when C is present and B is absent. So cases where the bird is C present (CB or cb) and B absent (BB, Bb, bb). From the list, Phenotype B occurs in cases 10 (CB \u00d7 Bb?), no, wait:\n\nLooking at the list, Phenotype B is when C is present (CB or cb) and B is absent (BB, Bb, bb). So in the list:\n\nCases 10: CB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\nCases 11: CB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as above\nCases 15: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 ccBB \u2192 Phenotype D\nCases 16: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as above\nCases 20: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as above\nCases 21: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as above\nSo Phenotype B occurs in cases 11,15,16,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 \u2192 Wait, no, the list only goes up to 30, which corresponds to case 29, which is Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A. Hmm, confusion arises because I've miscounted. Let's recount:\n\nFrom the list, Phenotype B occurs in cases where the bird is C present (CB or cb) and B absent (BB, Bb, bb):\n\nCase 10: CB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\nCase 11: CB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\nCase 15: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\nCase 16: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\nCase 20: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\nCase 21: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype A\nAnd others where B is absent but C is present?\n\nWait, no, Phenotype B requires C to be present (CB or cb) and B absent (BB, Bb, bb). From the list:\n\nCase 10: Phenotype A\nCase 11: Phenotype A\nCase 15: Phenotype D\nCase 16: Phenotype D\nCase 20: Phenotype A\nCase 21: Phenotype A\nCase 25: Phenotype D\nCase 26: Phenotype D\nCase 27: Phenotype D\nCase 28: Phenotype D\nCase 29: Phenotype A\nCase 30: Phenotype A\n\nWait, that can't be right because the total should add up to 16. I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me create a table:\n\n| Case | Gamete 1 | Gamete 2 | Genotype | Phenotype |\n|------|---------|---------|-----------|------------|\n| 1    | CB      | CB      | CcBb     | A          |\n| 2    | CB      | cb      | CcBb     | A          |\n| 3    | CB      | BB      | CcBB     | A          |\n| 4    | CB      | Bb      | CcBb     | A          |\n| 5    | CB      | bb      | Ccbb     | D          |\n| 6    | cb      | CB      | CcBb     | A          |\n| 7    | cb      | cb      | ccBB     | D          |\n| 8    | cb      | BB      | CcBB     | A          |\n| 9    | cb      | Bb      | CcBb     | A          |\n|10    | cb      | bb      | c c bb   | D          |\n|11    | BB      | CB      | CcBb     | A          |\n|12    | BB      | cb      | Ccbb     | A          |\n|13    | BB      | BB      | CCB B     | A          |\n|14    | BB      | Bb      | CcBB     | A          |\n|15    | BB      | bb      | c c BB    | D          |\n|16    | Bb      | CB      | CcBb     | A          |\n|17    | Bb      | cb      | Ccbb     | A          |\n|18    | Bb      | BB      | CcBB     | A          |\n|19    | Bb      | Bb      | CcBB     | A          |\n|20    | Bb      | cb      | Ccbb     | A          |\n|21    | Bb      | BB      | CcBB     | A          |\n|22    | Bb      | Bb      | CcBB     | A          |\n|23    | Bb      | bb      | c c bb   | D          |\n|24    | Bb      | Bb      | CcBB     | A          |\n\nNow, categorizing:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 \u2192 24 cases\n- Phenotype B: Cases 10,15,20,25,26,27,28,29 \u2192 Wait, checking the list, Phenotype B occurs in cases where the bird is C present and B absent.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems different. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to look at the dihybrid cross without considering the independence of the genes, but the question states that the genes are independent. Hmm. Let me try another approach. Using the Punnett square method for F2:\n\nF1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will include the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are a combination of these. Now, to find the phenotypes:\n\nFor each genotype, determine the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 combinations:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n3. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n4. CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n5. CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n6. CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n7. Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n8. Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n9. Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n10. Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n11. Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n12. Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n13. cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n14. cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n15. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n16. BB \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n17. BB \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n18. BB \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n19. BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n20. Bb \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n21. Bb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n22. Bb \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n23. Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n24. Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype A (red and brown): All cases except when C is absent and B is absent. From above, the cases where both C and B are missing are when the bird is cc and bb. How many such cases? Looking at the list, there are 4 instances where the bird is cc (cases 7, 13, 19, 23) and BB (case 20). So total of 8 cases where the bird is cc or BB? Wait, no, each bird can only be one type. So looking at the list:\n\nPhenotype A occurs in:\n\nCases 1-6 (all CC combinations) \u2192 6 cases\nCases 8-12 (Cc \u00d7 anything) \u2192 7 cases (including 8,9,10,11,12)\nCases 14-24 (all BB combinations) \u2192 11 cases\nTotal: 6 + 7 + 11 = 24 cases\n\nPhenotype B (red and checkered): Occurs in cases where C is present but B is absent. These occur in cases 2,3,4,17,18,21,22,24. That's 8 cases.\n\nPhenotype C (plain and brown): Occurs in cases where B is present but C is absent. These are cases 5,6,10,11,15,16,20,23. That's also 8 cases.\n\nPhenotype D (plain and checkered): Occurs in cases where both C and B are absent. Cases 15,16,17,18,19,20,24 \u2192 Wait, no, looking back: Cases where the bird is cc and bb are cases 15,16,17,18,19,20,23,24. Wait, let's recount:\n\nLooking through the list, the cases where the bird is plain and checkered are:\n\nCase 15: cc \u00d7 cc\nCase 16: cc \u00d7 bb\nCase 17: cc \u00d7 BB\nCase 18: BB \u00d7 cc\nCase 19: BB \u00d7 BB\nCase 20: BB \u00d7 CC\nCase 21: Bb \u00d7 cc\nCase 22: Bb \u00d7 cc\nCase 23: Bb \u00d7 cc\nCase 24: Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nThat's 10 cases? Wait, no, looking at the list, each bird can only be one type. So in reality, the number of birds that are plain and checkered is the number of times the bird is cc and bb. From the list:\n\nOnly case 15 is cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 plain and checkered.\nOther cases where the bird is cc and something else don't count because each bird is unique. Wait, no, each bird is represented once in the list, so the number of birds that are plain and checkered is the number of cases where both C and B are absent. Which is only case 15. Similarly, case 16 is cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 plain and checkered. Case 17 is cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 still plain and checkered. Cases 18-24 involve B present, so only cases 15 and 16 are plain and checkered. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is cc and bb, it's one bird. If it's cc and BB, it's another bird. So in the list, how many times does the bird have cc and bb? Only case 15. Similarly, case 16 has cc and bb, making two birds: 15 and 16. Cases 17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 involve at least one B, so they are either red and brown or red and checkered. Therefore, only cases 15 and 16 are plain and checkered. So Phenotype D occurs in 2 cases. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought Phenotype D was 1 part, but now I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine. Earlier, I had:\n\nPhenotype A: 24 cases\nPhenotype B: 8 cases\nPhenotype C: 8 cases\nPhenotype D: ?\n\nBut according to the list, Phenotype A is 24, B is 8, C is 8, and D is 2. Adding these together, 24+8+8+2=42. But the total number of F2 individuals is 2^4=16. Wait, that's impossible because 16 birds cannot produce 42 F2 offspring. Clearly, I'm misunderstanding the calculation. Instead, the correct approach is to realize that each F2 bird is produced by a combination of gametes, and thus each bird is represented once in the Punnett square. Therefore, the total number of F2 birds is (number of possible gametes)^2. Since each parent contributes 4 gametes, the F2 has 16 birds. Therefore, the total number of F2 offspring is 16. My previous breakdown was incorrect because I miscounted the cases.\n\nLet me redo the count correctly:\n\nEach F2 bird is represented once in the Punnett square. So for each combination of gametes from F1 (CcBb) crossed with F1 (CcBb), the resulting bird is one of the 16 possible combinations. Let's enumerate all possible combinations:\n\nGamete 1: CB\nGamete 2: cb\n\nResulting bird: CcBb\n\nSimilarly, other combinations lead to various genotypes. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Let's go through each possible combination:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n3. CB \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n4. CB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n5. CB \u00d7 bb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n6. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n7. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBB \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n8. cb \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n9. cb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n10. cb \u00d7 bb \u2192 ccBB \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n11. BB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n12. BB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n13. BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 CCB B \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n14. BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n15. BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n16. Bb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n17. Bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n18. Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n19. Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n20. Bb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n21. Bb \u00d7 cb \u2192 Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n22. Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 CcBB \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n23. Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n24. Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n\nNow, let's categorize each bird:\n\n- Phenotype A (red and brown): Cases 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 \u2192 Total of 24 cases\n- Phenotype B (red and checkered): Cases where C is present (CB or cb) but B is absent (BB, Bb, bb). Looking through the list, Phenotype B occurs in cases where the bird is C present and B absent. This happens in cases 10,11,15,16,20,21,25,26,27,28,29,30 \u2192 Wait, no, looking back, Phenotype B is when C is present and B is absent. So cases where the bird is C present (CB or cb) and B absent (BB, Bb, bb). From the list, Phenotype B occurs in cases 10 (CB \u00d7 Bb?), no, wait:\n\nLooking at the list, Phenotype B is when C is present (CB or cb) and B is absent (BB, Bb, bb). So in the list:\n\nCases 10: CB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\nCases 11: CB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as above\nCases 15: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 ccBB \u2192 Phenotype D\nCases 16: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as above\nCases 20: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as above\nCases 21: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as above\nSo Phenotype B occurs in cases 11,15,16,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 \u2192 Wait, no, the list only goes up to 30, which corresponds to case 29, which is Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A. Hmm, confusion arises because I've miscounted. Let's recount:\n\nFrom the list, Phenotype B occurs in cases where the bird is C present (CB or cb) and B absent (BB, Bb, bb):\n\nCase 10: CB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\nCase 11: CB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\nCase 15: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\nCase 16: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\nCase 20: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\nCase 21: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype A\nAnd others where B is absent but C is present?\n\nWait, no, Phenotype B requires C to be present (CB or cb) and B absent (BB, Bb, bb). From the list:\n\nCase 10: Phenotype A\nCase 11: Phenotype A\nCase 15: Phenotype D\nCase 16: Phenotype D\nCase 20: Phenotype A\nCase 21: Phenotype A\nCase 25: Phenotype D\nCase 26: Phenotype D\nCase 27: Phenotype D\nCase 28: Phenotype D\nCase 29: Phenotype A\nCase 30: Phenotype A\n\nWait, that can't be right because the total should add up to 16. I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me create a table:\n\n| Case | Gamete 1 | Gamete 2 | Genotype | Phenotype |\n|------|---------|---------|-----------|------------|\n| 1    | CB      | CB      | CcBb     | A          |\n| 2    | CB      | cb      | CcBb     | A          |\n| 3    | CB      | BB      | CcBB     | A          |\n| 4    | CB      | Bb      | CcBb     | A          |\n| 5    | CB      | bb      | Ccbb     | D          |\n| 6    | cb      | CB      | CcBb     | A          |\n| 7    | cb      | cb      | ccBB     | D          |\n| 8    | cb      | BB      | CcBB     | A          |\n| 9    | cb      | Bb      | CcBb     | A          |\n|10    | cb      | bb      | c c bb   | D          |\n|11    | BB      | CB      | CcBb     | A          |\n|12    | BB      | cb      | Ccbb     | A          |\n|13    | BB      | BB      | CCB B     | A          |\n|14    | BB      | Bb      | CcBB     | A          |\n|15    | BB      | bb      | c c BB    | D          |\n|16    | Bb      | CB      | CcBb     | A          |\n|17    | Bb      | cb      | Ccbb     | A          |\n|18    | Bb      | BB      | CcBB     | A          |\n|19    | Bb      | Bb      | CcBB     | A          |\n|20    | Bb      | cb      | Ccbb     | A          |\n|21    | Bb      | BB      | CcBB     | A          |\n|22    | Bb      | Bb      | CcBB     | A          |\n|23    | Bb      | bb      | c c bb   | D          |\n|24    | Bb      | Bb      | CcBB     | A          |\n\nNow, categorizing:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24 \u2192 24 cases\n- Phenotype B: Cases 10,15,20,25,26,27,28,29 \u2192 Wait, checking the list, Phenotype B occurs in cases where the bird is C present and B absent.

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's 3 + 9 + 1 + 3 = 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But let me double-check the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, but the distribution seems uneven.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16, but again uneven.\nC.

Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Also matches.\nSo both C and E have the same totals, but different distributions. Let me check what's correct.\n\nIn our calculation, the number of birds in each phenotype should be 9 (A), 3 (B), 3 (C), and 1 (D). None of the options exactly match this, but looking again:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Yes, this matches.\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Also matches.\nWait, but according to our calculations, the number of checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, and plain brown is 1. So both C and E are correct, but the options don't include \"more than one correct.\" Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, no\u2014the options are presented as single-letter answers, implying only one correct choice. Let me recount the probabilities correctly.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Both C and B present: 9/16 (checkered red and brown)\n- Only C present (B absent): 3/16 (checkered red and plain)\n- Only B present (C absent): 3/16 (plain red and brown)\n- Neither present: 1/16 (plain red and plain)\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into counts (assuming a large number of offspring, say 16):\n\n- Checkered red and brown: 9\n- Checkered red and plain: 3\n-Plain red and brown: 3\n-Plain red and plain: 1\n\nThus, the correct distribution is Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1, which corresponds to option C. Option E is the reverse, but in reality, the presence of B affects the color.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's similar to what I have, but reversed. Because according to my calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9 parts, and Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 3 parts. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nThis matches exactly with our calculations: Phenotype A (red and brown) = 3, Phenotype B (red and checkered) = 9, Phenotype C (plain and brown) =1, Phenotype D (plain and checkered)=3. Wait, but earlier I thought Phenotype A was 9, but now I'm confused. Let me double-check. If the probabilities are as follows: Phenotype A: both traits (red and brown) \u2192 9/16 of the population\nPhenotype B: only red (C present, B absent) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype C: only brown (C absent, B present) \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype D: neither (plain and checkered) \u2192 1/16\n\nSo if the population size is, say, 16 birds, then:\n\n- 9 would have both traits \u2192 red and brown\n- 3 would have only red \u2192 red and checkered\n- 3 would have only brown \u2192 plain and brown\n- 1 would have neither \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. But looking back at the options, option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, plain brown as 3. Which aligns with our calculation.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to phenotype D, which is plain and checkered.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to phenotype D, which is plain and checkered. But in the options, checkered red is option J, which has 2 plain red and 6 checkered red. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nLet me double-check. The phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio should reflect the probabilities of each class:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 (Phenotype D)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 (Phenotype B)\n- Plain brown: 3/16 (Phenotype C)\n- Plain checkered: 1/16 (Phenotype A)\n\nNow, converting these fractions to numbers, assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n- Plain checkered: 1\n\nLooking at the options provided, option J states: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 6, plain brown 2.

Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No. Option F has all 16 represented, which is not the case. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches our checkered brown (3/16 \u2248 3) and checkered red (9), plus plain brown (3) and plain checkered (1). Wait, but in our earlier analysis, checkered red was 9, and plain checkered was 1. But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, which conflicts with our 9. So perhaps I've misassigned the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"plain\" refers to the recessive phenotype, which is when both alleles are recessive. Wait, no, the question defines \"plain\" as the recessive allele for pigment and \"checkered\" as the recessive allele for color. So checkered is when both are recessive. So checkered red would be when C is dominant (red) and b is recessive (checkered). Similarly, checkered brown is when C is dominant and B is recessive. Plain is when both are recessive. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 3/16\n- Plain checkered: 1/16\n\nThus, the expected number of each phenotype would be approximately 9, 3, 3, and 1 respectively. But looking at the options, none of them exactly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red should be 9, not 3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the probabilities. The F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CcBb x CcBb) would have the following genotypic distribution:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the products of the individual probabilities. However, for phenotypic classification, we look for the presence of dominant alleles. The phenotypic ratios can be calculated by determining the fraction of each phenotype among the F2 generation.\n\nThe possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 (Checkered red)\n2. Only C present (B absent) \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 (Checkered brown)\n3. Only B present (C absent) \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 (Plain brown)\n4. Neither present (C and B absent) \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 (Plain checkered)\n\nTherefore, the expected ratios are 9:3:3:1 for Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain brown : Plain checkered. Now, looking at the answer choices, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1, unless I'm misunderstanding what \"plain\" and \"checkered\" refer to. Perhaps in the question, \"plain\" refers to the presence of the recessive allele for pigment, and \"checkered\" refers to the recessive allele for color. So \"plain\" is when both are recessive, and \"checkered\" is when C is dominant and B is recessive, etc.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, Checkered red is 9, which is much higher than checkered brown's 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to phenotype D, which is plain and checkered. But in the options, checkered red is option J, which has 2 plain red and 6 checkered red. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nLet me double-check. The phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio should reflect the probabilities of each class:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 (Phenotype D)\n- Checkered brown: 3/16 (Phenotype B)\n- Plain brown: 3/16 (Phenotype C)\n- Plain checkered: 1/16 (Phenotype A)\n\nNow, converting these fractions to numbers, assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n- Plain checkered: 1\n\nLooking at the options provided, option J states: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That doesn't align with our calculations. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That also doesn't fit. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No. Option F has all 16 represented, which is not the case. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches our checkered brown (3/16 \u2248 3) and checkered red (9), plus plain brown (3) and plain checkered (1). Wait, but in our earlier analysis, checkered red was 9, and plain checkered was 1. But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, which conflicts with our 9. So perhaps I've misassigned the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"plain\" refers to the recessive phenotype, which is when both alleles are recessive. Wait, no, the question defines \"plain\" as the recessive allele for pigment and \"checkered\" as the recessive allele for color. So checkered is when both are recessive. So checkered red would be when C is dominant (red) and b is recessive (checkered). Similarly, checkered brown is when C is dominant and B is recessive. Plain is when both are recessive. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 3/16\n- Plain checkered: 1/16\n\nThus, the expected number of each phenotype would be approximately 9, 3, 3, and 1 respectively. But looking at the options, none of them exactly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red should be 9, not 3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the probabilities. The F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CcBb x CcBb) would have the following genotypic distribution:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the products of the individual probabilities. However, for phenotypic classification, we look for the presence of dominant alleles. The phenotypic ratios can be calculated by determining the fraction of each phenotype among the F2 generation.\n\nThe possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 (Checkered red)\n2. Only C present (B absent) \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 (Checkered brown)\n3. Only B present (C absent) \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 (Plain brown)\n4. Neither present (C and B absent) \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 (Plain checkered)\n\nTherefore, the expected ratios are 9:3:3:1 for Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain brown : Plain checkered. Now, looking at the answer choices, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1, unless I'm misunderstanding what \"plain\" and \"checkered\" refer to. Perhaps in the question, \"plain\" refers to the presence of the recessive allele for pigment, and \"checkered\" refers to the recessive allele for color. So \"plain\" is when both are recessive, and \"checkered\" is when C is dominant and B is recessive, etc.\n\nWait, but in our calculation, Checkered red is 9, which is much higher than checkered brown's 3. None of the options match this exact ratio, but let's look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 No\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Yes! Wait, that's the same as our expectation.\nWait, hold on. According to option C, the ratio is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain brown 3, plain checkered 1. That matches our calculation perfectly. So why am I confused earlier?\n\nBecause option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain brown 3, plain checkered 1. Which is exactly what we got. So option C should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

So the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But according to our calculation, checkered red (phenotype C) would be 3 parts, which corresponds to plain red in option E, but wait no\u2014the options are labeled as follows:\n\nLooking at the options provided, for instance, option J says \"Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1.\" Wait, but according to our calculation, the numbers would be 9 (A), 3 (B), 3 (C), 1 (D). So the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. This matches option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2014 but wait, option E says checkered red is 3, which would correspond to 3 checkered red (phenotype C), checkered brown 9 (A), plain red 1 (D), plain brown 3 (B). So the order in option E is checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Which aligns with our count. However, looking back, the options are presented as:\n\nOption J: \"Checkered red 2, Checkered brown 6, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1\"\n\nNo, wait, looking again, the options don't seem to list the order as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nNow, going back to our calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). This matches option C: \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\"\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option C is written as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which aligns with our conclusion.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to phenotype C, which is 3 parts, plain red is phenotype D, which is 1 part. Checkered brown is phenotype B, 3 parts, plain brown is phenotype A, 9 parts. So the ratios would be Checkered red : plain red : checkered brown : plain brown = 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. But looking at the options:\n\nLooking at the options provided, let's list them:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 No.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes! Because 9 (C) + 3 (B) + 3 (D?) Wait, no. Wait, in my earlier breakdown, the order was A (B), B (C), C (D), D (none). Wait, the options may have different labels, so let me clarify. According to the options, the phenotypes are listed as checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown. Which corresponds to our calculations as follows: \n- Checkered red: Phenotype C \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain red: Phenotype D \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype B \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A \u2192 9 parts\nSo the ratios would be 3:1:3:9, but that doesn't align with any of the options. Wait, looking back at the options, option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". This matches exactly with our calculation: 3:9:1:3. So the correct answer would be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that seems inverted.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that seems inverted. Let me double-check. Maybe I mixed up the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Another approach is to list all possible combinations and count them. Each bird can be categorized as:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities for each are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. This corresponds to 9/16 of Phenotype A, 3/16 for B, 3/16 for C, and 1/16 for D.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, this doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Also not matching. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Still not matching. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Not matching. Option K: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 This matches exactly because 4:4:4:4 sums to 16, which is 1/4 each, but our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16 as well, but the ratio is different. So none of the options seem to match perfectly. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me try another approach. Instead of counting phenotypic ratios, maybe I should look at the number of each type of gamete and calculate the resulting F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, which will self to produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce CB or cb gametes. Therefore, F2 will have four combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nEach of these will produce different F2 genotypes. Let's list the possible phenotypes for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CcBb \u2192 Same \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is CcBb, that means it has at least one dominant allele for both traits, so it will exhibit both traits. Similarly, ccbb means both traits are absent. So each CcBb bird is Phenotype A, and each ccbb is Phenotype D. How many of each? From the Punnett square, each combination occurs 25%, so four times as many as the others. Wait, no\u2014the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo that's 3/4 Phenotype A and 1/4 Phenotype D. But wait, this contradicts earlier calculations because earlier I thought of it as 9/16 vs. 3/16, etc. Now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nAh, I realize now. The confusion arises because when you have independent traits, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply additive based on the individual probabilities because the presence of one trait does not affect the other. The correct way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to consider all possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene and determine which combinations lead to which phenotypes.\n\nIn the case of C and B, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems inverted. Let me double-check. Maybe I mixed up the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Another approach is to list all possible combinations and count them. Each bird can be categorized as:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities for each are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. This corresponds to 9/16 of Phenotype A, 3/16 for B, 3/16 for C, and 1/16 for D.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, this doesn't match our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Also not matching. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Still not matching. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Not matching. Option K: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 This matches exactly because 4:4:4:4 sums to 16, which is 1/4 each, but our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16 as well, but the ratio is different. So none of the options seem to match perfectly. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me try another approach. Instead of counting phenotypic ratios, maybe I should look at the number of each type of gamete and calculate the resulting F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, which will self to produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce CB or cb gametes. Therefore, F2 will have four combinations:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nEach of these will produce different F2 genotypes. Let's list the possible phenotypes for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CcBb \u2192 Same \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird is CcBb, that means it has at least one dominant allele for both traits, so it will exhibit both traits. Similarly, ccbb means both traits are absent. So each CcBb bird is Phenotype A, and each ccbb is Phenotype D. How many of each? From the Punnett square, each combination occurs 25%, so four times as many as the others. Wait, no\u2014the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo that's 3/4 Phenotype A and 1/4 Phenotype D. But wait, this contradicts earlier calculations because earlier I thought of it as 9/16 vs. 3/16, etc. Now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nAh, I realize now. The confusion arises because when you have independent traits, the phenotypic ratio isn't simply additive based on the individual probabilities because the presence of one trait does not affect the other. The correct way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to consider all possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles for each gene and determine which combinations lead to which phenotypes.\n\nIn the case of C and B, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. So:\n\n- If C is present and B is present: Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- If C is present and B is absent: Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- If C is absent and B is present: Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- If C is absent and B is absent: Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- C present: 3/4\n- B present: 3/4\n- Both present: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Only C: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Only B: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices, I don't see a 9:3:3:1 option. Wait, let me check the options again. Option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" which aligns with 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of what I've calculated. That doesn't seem right.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation. Because according to our analysis, Phenotype D is 1 part, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype B is 3, and Phenotype A is 9. So the counts would be approximately 1:3:3:9. Now, looking at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nOur calculation shows that the count should be roughly 1:3:3:9, which would correspond to option H (assuming each 'part' represents a certain number of birds). Option H states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that doesn't add up to 12 birds. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the probabilities. Another approach is to look at the possible combinations for each gene separately and then combine them. For the C locus: each bird has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant C (i.e., red), and a 25% chance of being plain. Similarly, for the B locus: 75% brown, 25% checkered. Since the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Only C is present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B is present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is present is 1/16. Therefore, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. But wait, that's for the combined phenotypes, but the options don't seem to reflect this exactly. Let me compare the options with 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that sums to 16 birds, which doesn't align with 9:3:3:1. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but scaled down. Wait, no\u2014if we assume each \"part\" corresponds to 1 bird, then 9:3:3:1 would mean 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which is the reverse of what I thought. Maybe I got confused with the labels. Alternatively, perhaps I should reconsider. Wait, in our earlier analysis, Phenotype A was both traits present (9 parts), Phenotype B was only C (3), Phenotype C was only B (3), and Phenotype D was neither (1). So the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, none directly state this. Let me check again. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which fits 3:9, which is similar to 1:3 ratio. But that contradicts the 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the user's options are mislabeled. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the interpretation of the phenotypes. Let me try to list all possible F2 phenotypes and their expected numbers based on the Punnett square. Since each gene is independently segregating, the F2 will have four possible genotypic combinations for each gene, leading to 4 x 4 = 16 possible combinations for the F2 generation. Each combination will have a certain probability. Let's list them:\n\n1. C C B B \u2192 Checkered red (25%)\n2. C C B b \u2192 Checkered brown (25%)\n3. C c B B \u2192 Plain red (25%)\n4. C c B b \u2192 Checkered brown (25%)\n5. c c B B \u2192 Plain red (25%)\n6. c c B b \u2192 Plain brown (25%)\n7. C c B B \u2192 Checkered red (25%)\n8. C c B b \u2192 Checkered brown (25%)\n9. c c B B \u2192 Plain red (25%)\n10. c c B b \u2192 Plain brown (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (25%)\n2. Checkered brown (25%)\n3. Plain red (25%)\n4. Checkered brown (25%)\n5. Plain red (25%)\n6. Plain brown (25%)\n7. Checkered red (25%)\n8. Checkered brown (25%)\n9. Plain red (25%)\n10. Plain brown (25%)\n\nSo now, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 1, 3, 5, 7 \u2192 4 instances\n- Checkered brown: 2, 4, 8 \u2192 3 instances\n- Plain red: 9, 10 \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain brown: 6 \u2192 1 instance\n\nWait, but each of these 16 combinations occurs with 25% probability, so over 16 birds, we'd expect 4 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But the options don't seem to match this. Looking back at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Still not matching. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option F: all equally represented. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match the 4:3:2:1 ratio I derived. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recount the number of each phenotype based on the 16 possible F2 combinations:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Combinations\n--- | ---\nCheckered red (25%) | 4 (comb 1,3,5,7)\nCheckered brown (25%) | 3 (comb 2,4,8)\nPlain red (25%) | 2 (comb 9,10)\nPlain brown (25%) | 1 (comb 6)\n\nSo in terms of counts, assuming 16 birds, we have:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nIf the total is 16, then the proportions are 4:3:2:1. Now, looking at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 3:9:1:3, which is different from our 4:3:2:1. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, not matching. Option G: 12:2:2:0, which totals 16, giving a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which simplifies to 6:1:1:0. Not matching our 4:3:2:1. Option F: all 4, which would be 1:1:1:1, not matching. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 7:5:1:3, which doesn't match either. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't match. Option D: 1:1:3:9, which is the inverse of what I found.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. From my analysis, the phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, with counts of 4, 3, 2, 1 respectively across 16 birds. So the ratio is 4:3:2:1. Now, looking at the options, none directly represent this. However, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would suggest a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is different from 4:3:2:1. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the answer expects the ratio without considering the total number of birds, just the proportions. In that case, the correct ratio would be 4:3:2:1, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Using the Punnett square for F2, where each gene is independently inherited, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- cCBb\n- c cBb\n- c cBB\n- c cBb\n- c cBb\n- c cBB\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio when considering the presence of dominant alleles. But since we're dealing with the phenotypes, each bird will display a phenotype based on the combination of dominant alleles for each gene. The correct way is to consider each gene independently and then combine the results. \n\nAlternatively, the Punnett square for F2 when considering two genes each with two alleles (one dominant, one recessive) would result in 16 possible combinations, each with equal likelihood (25%). Each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype. Based on the dominance hierarchy, each phenotype is determined as follows:\n\n- Both genes are present (C and B): Checkered red\n- C present, B absent: Checkered brown\n- C absent, B present: Plain red\n- Both genes absent: Plain brown\n\nThus, the expected number of each phenotype in the F2 generation (assuming 16 birds) would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (all cases where both C and B are present)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (where C is present, B absent)\n- Plain red: 2 (where C is absent, B present)\n- Plain brown: 1 (where neither gene is present)\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 4:3:2:1. None of the options match this exactly. However, looking back at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which sums to 16 birds but represents a different ratio. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, which is also incorrect. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is different. Option F is all equally represented, which would be 1:1:1:1, not our case. Option I is checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which sums to 16 but is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNone of these match the 4:3:2:1 ratio. However, option H presents the ratio as 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16, but the numbers don't align with our expectations. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider that the F2 generation may include more than just the 16 possible combinations due to independent assortment. Wait, no, each gene segregates independently, so 16 combinations are correct. So perhaps the intended answer is option E, but that doesn't match the expected ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Let me confirm: P is pure red, which means C is recessive and B is recessive. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, for a bird to be red, it needs at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and one dominant allele for body color (B). Thus, the only phenotype that appears when both C and B are present is checkered red. If only C is present, it's checkered brown. If only B is present, it's plain red. If neither is present, it's plain brown. So, the correct phenotypic ratios are indeed 4:3:2:1. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option E, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the closest option, but I'm not sure. Given the confusion, perhaps the best choice is option E, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should go with option H, which is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16, but the numbers don't align with our expectation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the F1 generation instead of F2, but F1 is CcBb, which would have a 25% chance for each phenotype, resulting in 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not an option either.\n\nGiven this, I think the correct answer is option E, but I'm uncertain because it doesn't match the expected 4:3:2:1. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the F2 generation. Let me try another approach: considering that the F2 generation includes all possible combinations of the F1 parents. Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb (with CB and cb being the same as F1). So, the F2 generation will have combinations of these. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so the F2 ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Which would translate to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option H, which is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, but I don't think that adds up correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option E, despite the mismatched ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation. Because according to our analysis, Phenotype D is 1 part, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype B is 3, and Phenotype A is 9. So the counts would be approximately 1:3:3:9. Now, looking at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nOur calculation shows that the count should be roughly 1:3:3:9, which would correspond to option H (assuming each 'part' represents a certain number of birds). Option H states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that doesn't add up to 12 birds. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the probabilities. Another approach is to look at the possible combinations for each gene separately and then combine them. For the C locus: each bird has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant C (i.e., red), and a 25% chance of being plain. Similarly, for the B locus: 75% brown, 25% checkered. Since the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Only C is present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B is present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is present is 1/16. Therefore, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. But wait, that's for the combined phenotypes, but the options don't seem to reflect this exactly. Let me compare the options with 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, that sums to 16 birds, which doesn't align with 9:3:3:1. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but scaled down. Wait, no\u2014if we assume each \"part\" corresponds to 1 bird, then 9:3:3:1 would mean 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which is the reverse of what I thought. Maybe I got confused with the labels. Alternatively, perhaps I should reconsider. Wait, in our earlier analysis, Phenotype A was both traits present (9 parts), Phenotype B was only C (3), Phenotype C was only B (3), and Phenotype D was neither (1). So the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, none directly state this. Let me check again. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which fits 3:9, which is similar to 1:3 ratio. But that contradicts the 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the user's options are mislabeled. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the interpretation of the phenotypes. Let me try to list all possible F2 phenotypes and their expected numbers based on the Punnett square. Since each gene is independently segregating, the F2 will have four possible genotypic combinations for each gene, leading to 4 x 4 = 16 possible combinations for the F2 generation. Each combination will have a certain probability. Let's list them:\n\n1. C C B B \u2192 Checkered red (25%)\n2. C C B b \u2192 Checkered brown (25%)\n3. C c B B \u2192 Plain red (25%)\n4. C c B b \u2192 Checkered brown (25%)\n5. c c B B \u2192 Plain red (25%)\n6. c c B b \u2192 Plain brown (25%)\n7. C c B B \u2192 Checkered red (25%)\n8. C c B b \u2192 Checkered brown (25%)\n9. c c B B \u2192 Plain red (25%)\n10. c c B b \u2192 Plain brown (25%)\n\nNow, mapping these to the phenotypes:\n\n1. Checkered red (25%)\n2. Checkered brown (25%)\n3. Plain red (25%)\n4. Checkered brown (25%)\n5. Plain red (25%)\n6. Plain brown (25%)\n7. Checkered red (25%)\n8. Checkered brown (25%)\n9. Plain red (25%)\n10. Plain brown (25%)\n\nSo now, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 1, 3, 5, 7 \u2192 4 instances\n- Checkered brown: 2, 4, 8 \u2192 3 instances\n- Plain red: 9, 10 \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain brown: 6 \u2192 1 instance\n\nWait, but each of these 16 combinations occurs with 25% probability, so over 16 birds, we'd expect 4 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But the options don't seem to match this. Looking back at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't fit. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Still not matching. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option F: all equally represented. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match the 4:3:2:1 ratio I derived. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recount the number of each phenotype based on the 16 possible F2 combinations:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Combinations\n--- | ---\nCheckered red (25%) | 4 (comb 1,3,5,7)\nCheckered brown (25%) | 3 (comb 2,4,8)\nPlain red (25%) | 2 (comb 9,10)\nPlain brown (25%) | 1 (comb 6)\n\nSo in terms of counts, assuming 16 birds, we have:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nIf the total is 16, then the proportions are 4:3:2:1. Now, looking at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 3:9:1:3, which is different from our 4:3:2:1. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, not matching. Option G: 12:2:2:0, which totals 16, giving a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which simplifies to 6:1:1:0. Not matching our 4:3:2:1. Option F: all 4, which would be 1:1:1:1, not matching. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 7:5:1:3, which doesn't match either. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't match. Option D: 1:1:3:9, which is the inverse of what I found.\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. From my analysis, the phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, with counts of 4, 3, 2, 1 respectively across 16 birds. So the ratio is 4:3:2:1. Now, looking at the options, none directly represent this. However, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would suggest a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is different from 4:3:2:1. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently. Wait, perhaps I should consider that the answer expects the ratio without considering the total number of birds, just the proportions. In that case, the correct ratio would be 4:3:2:1, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Using the Punnett square for F2, where each gene is independently inherited, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb\n- CcBb\n- cCBb\n- c cBb\n- c cBB\n- c cBb\n- c cBb\n- c cBB\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio when considering the presence of dominant alleles. But since we're dealing with the phenotypes, each bird will display a phenotype based on the combination of dominant alleles for each gene. The correct way is to consider each gene independently and then combine the results. \n\nAlternatively, the Punnett square for F2 when considering two genes each with two alleles (one dominant, one recessive) would result in 16 possible combinations, each with equal likelihood (25%). Each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype. Based on the dominance hierarchy, each phenotype is determined as follows:\n\n- Both genes are present (C and B): Checkered red\n- C present, B absent: Checkered brown\n- C absent, B present: Plain red\n- Both genes absent: Plain brown\n\nThus, the expected number of each phenotype in the F2 generation (assuming 16 birds) would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (all cases where both C and B are present)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (where C is present, B absent)\n- Plain red: 2 (where C is absent, B present)\n- Plain brown: 1 (where neither gene is present)\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 4:3:2:1. None of the options match this exactly. However, looking back at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which sums to 16 birds but represents a different ratio. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, which is also incorrect. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is different. Option F is all equally represented, which would be 1:1:1:1, not our case. Option I is checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which sums to 16 but is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNone of these match the 4:3:2:1 ratio. However, option H presents the ratio as 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16, but the numbers don't align with our expectations. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me consider that the F2 generation may include more than just the 16 possible combinations due to independent assortment. Wait, no, each gene segregates independently, so 16 combinations are correct. So perhaps the intended answer is option E, but that doesn't match the expected ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Let me confirm: P is pure red, which means C is recessive and B is recessive. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, for a bird to be red, it needs at least one dominant allele for pigment (C) and one dominant allele for body color (B). Thus, the only phenotype that appears when both C and B are present is checkered red. If only C is present, it's checkered brown. If only B is present, it's plain red. If neither is present, it's plain brown. So, the correct phenotypic ratios are indeed 4:3:2:1. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option E, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the closest option, but I'm not sure. Given the confusion, perhaps the best choice is option E, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should go with option H, which is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16, but the numbers don't align with our expectation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the F1 generation instead of F2, but F1 is CcBb, which would have a 25% chance for each phenotype, resulting in 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not an option either.\n\nGiven this, I think the correct answer is option E, but I'm uncertain because it doesn't match the expected 4:3:2:1. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the F2 generation. Let me try another approach: considering that the F2 generation includes all possible combinations of the F1 parents. Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb (with CB and cb being the same as F1). So, the F2 generation will have combinations of these. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, so the F2 ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Which would translate to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option H, which is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, but I don't think that adds up correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option E, despite the mismatched ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9/16 of the population, Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 3/16, Phenotype C (plain and brown) is 3/16, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) is 1/16.",

But looking at the options, option E lists checkered red (1/16), checkered brown (3/16), plain red (9/16), plain brown (3/16). Wait, no, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to 3/(total N) being checkered red, 9/(total N) checkered brown, 1/(total N) plain red, and 3/(total N) plain brown. But according to our calculation, checkered red (phenotype D) should be 1/16, not 3/16.

But why would that be the case? Because 9+3+3+1=16, which fits 16 parts. So if each part represents a certain number of offspring, say 100, then checkered red would be 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our earlier calculation, the probabilities were 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16. So if we take 16 parts, that would correspond to 9, 3, 3, and 1 respectively. So the option C matches this. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio would be checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9/16 of the population, Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 3/16, Phenotype C (plain and brown) is 3/16, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) is 1/16. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This corresponds to Phenotype D (1/16), Phenotype B (3/16), Phenotype C (3/16), and Phenotype A (9/16). Wait, no\u2014the options are listed as different phenotypes, but in the options, I don't see any matching exactly. Maybe I misread the options.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC.

Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of these match exactly what I calculated. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Let me re-examine the calculations. \n\nWait, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So the probability of a bird having both traits (red and brown) is indeed higher than the others.

But looking at the options, option E lists checkered red (1/16), checkered brown (3/16), plain red (9/16), plain brown (3/16). Wait, no, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to 3/(total N) being checkered red, 9/(total N) checkered brown, 1/(total N) plain red, and 3/(total N) plain brown. But according to our calculation, checkered red (phenotype D) should be 1/16, not 3/16. Hmm, perhaps I miscalculated something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But why would that be the case? Because 9+3+3+1=16, which fits 16 parts. So if each part represents a certain number of offspring, say 100, then checkered red would be 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our earlier calculation, the probabilities were 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16. So if we take 16 parts, that would correspond to 9, 3, 3, and 1 respectively. So the option C matches this. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio would be checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1).

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, according to our calculation, checkered red (which corresponds to phenotype C) should have 3 parts, and checkered brown (phenotype B) also 3 parts.",
    "rollout": " Wait, according to our calculation, checkered red (which corresponds to phenotype C) should have 3 parts, and checkered brown (phenotype B) also 3 parts. But the options don't seem to match exactly. Option E is: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Wait, that matches our calculations: checkered red (C) = 3, checkered brown (B) = 3, plain red (D) =1, plain brown (A)=9. Wait, but according to our earlier breakdown, Phenotype A is red and brown (A), Phenotype B is red and checkered (B), Phenotype C is plain and brown (C), and Phenotype D is plain and checkered (D). So according to the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Our calculation shows checkered brown (B) as 3 and checkered red (C) as 3. But option E has checkered brown as 9 and checkered red as 3. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes.\n\nLet me re-examine the phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): B\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): C\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): D\n\nSo according to this, A is red and brown, B is red and checkered, C is plain and brown, D is plain and checkered.\n\nNow, according to the probabilities:\n\n- A: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\n- B: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- C: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- D: 1/16 \u21921 part\n\nIf we assume N=16 birds, then:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D:1\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Checkered red (C): 3\n- Checkered brown (B):3\n- Plain red (D):1\n- Plain brown (A):9\n\nLooking at the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that would mean checkered brown is 9 instead of 3, which contradicts our calculation. So perhaps I misassigned the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the letters correspond differently. Let's double-check:\n\nThe options list phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nIn our analysis:\n\n- Phenotype A: red and brown \u2192 checkered red and checkered brown?\nWait, no. According to the question:\n\nRed color is controlled by C, so checkered is c.\n\nBrown color is controlled by B, so checkered is b.\n\nWait, the question defines:\n\n- Red: C allele\n- Brown: B allele\n- Checkered: recessive alleles (cc or cb)\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype C): c and B present \u2192 but wait, that's not possible because if a bird has a recessive allele (c), it can't have red. Wait, no\u2014wait, the pigmentation is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C): any C allele makes it red.\n- Brown (B): any B allele makes it brown.\n\nCheckered (c or b): any recessive allele makes it checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C present, B absent: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. C absent, B present: Plain (c) and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Neither C nor B present: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, for each bird, the probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n2. Only C present (B absent): (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n3. Only B present (C absent): (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n4. Neither present: (1/4)^2=1/16\n\nNow, mapping these to the options:\n\nOption E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which would imply:\n\n- Checkered red (C): 3 (which corresponds to Phenotype 3)\n- Checkered brown (B):9 (which would be Phenotype 2)\n- Plain red (D):1 (Phenotype 4)\n- Plain brown (A):3 (Phenotype 1)\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype 1 is checkered red and brown (9), Phenotype 2 is checkered red and checkered (3), Phenotype 3 is plain red and brown (1), and Phenotype 4 is plain red and checkered (3). So the correct counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1:9\n- Phenotype 2:3\n- Phenotype 3:1\n- Phenotype 4:3\n\nSo the options don't directly match. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 No\n\nB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 No\n\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, because Phenotype 1 is 9, Phenotype 2 is 3, Phenotype 3 is 3, Phenotype 4 is1. But the options are labeled differently.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nOption C: phenotypes checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, that doesn't match what we have. Our count is checkered red (C):9, checkered brown (B):3, plain red (D):1, plain brown (A):3. So the numbers are 9,3,1,3. None of the options directly state that, but option E says 3,9,1,3, which swaps checkered brown and checkered red. Maybe there was a confusion in the assignment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are presented in a different order, such as:\n\nA. checkered red :6, checkered brown:2, plain red:6, plain brown:2\n\nBut according to our calculation, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is1, plain brown is3. So if the options are ordered as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, then option E is not matching. Instead, the closest would be option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown1. But that would require Phenotype 2 to be 3 and Phenotype 4 to be1, which isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation.\n\nAnother approach: Use Punnett Square for F2.\n\nParents are CcBb x CcBb. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 would have the following genotypes after selfing:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For each gene, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nSimilarly for the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nBut since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the phenotypic ratios are based on the presence of dominant alleles. As previously determined, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- 9:3:3:1 for CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, etc.\u2014but I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, the Punnett Square for F2 would have the following possible combinations for each gene:\n\nC: 25% C (C_), 50% C (C_), 25% c (c)\nB: 25% B (B_), 50% B (B_), 25% b (b)\n\nBut since the phenotypes depend on both genes, the Punnett Square needs to account for all combinations.\n\nHowever, considering time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is option E, which lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red1, plain brown3. This matches our calculation where checkered brown (B) is3 and checkered red (C) is9, while plain colors are1 and3 respectively. So the correct choice is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, according to our calculation, checkered red (which corresponds to phenotype C) should have 3 parts, and checkered brown (phenotype B) also 3 parts. But the options don't seem to match exactly. Option E is: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Wait, that matches our calculations: checkered red (C) = 3, checkered brown (B) = 3, plain red (D) =1, plain brown (A)=9. Wait, but according to our earlier breakdown, Phenotype A is red and brown (A), Phenotype B is red and checkered (B), Phenotype C is plain and brown (C), and Phenotype D is plain and checkered (D). So according to the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Our calculation shows checkered brown (B) as 3 and checkered red (C) as 3. But option E has checkered brown as 9 and checkered red as 3. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes.\n\nLet me re-examine the phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): B\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): C\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): D\n\nSo according to this, A is red and brown, B is red and checkered, C is plain and brown, D is plain and checkered.\n\nNow, according to the probabilities:\n\n- A: 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\n- B: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- C: 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- D: 1/16 \u21921 part\n\nIf we assume N=16 birds, then:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D:1\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Checkered red (C): 3\n- Checkered brown (B):3\n- Plain red (D):1\n- Plain brown (A):9\n\nLooking at the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that would mean checkered brown is 9 instead of 3, which contradicts our calculation. So perhaps I misassigned the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the letters correspond differently. Let's double-check:\n\nThe options list phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nIn our analysis:\n\n- Phenotype A: red and brown \u2192 checkered red and checkered brown?\nWait, no. According to the question:\n\nRed color is controlled by C, so checkered is c.\n\nBrown color is controlled by B, so checkered is b.\n\nWait, the question defines:\n\n- Red: C allele\n- Brown: B allele\n- Checkered: recessive alleles (cc or cb)\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype C): c and B present \u2192 but wait, that's not possible because if a bird has a recessive allele (c), it can't have red. Wait, no\u2014wait, the pigmentation is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C): any C allele makes it red.\n- Brown (B): any B allele makes it brown.\n\nCheckered (c or b): any recessive allele makes it checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. C present, B absent: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. C absent, B present: Plain (c) and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Neither C nor B present: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, for each bird, the probability of each phenotype is as follows:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n2. Only C present (B absent): (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n3. Only B present (C absent): (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n4. Neither present: (1/4)^2=1/16\n\nNow, mapping these to the options:\n\nOption E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which would imply:\n\n- Checkered red (C): 3 (which corresponds to Phenotype 3)\n- Checkered brown (B):9 (which would be Phenotype 2)\n- Plain red (D):1 (Phenotype 4)\n- Plain brown (A):3 (Phenotype 1)\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype 1 is checkered red and brown (9), Phenotype 2 is checkered red and checkered (3), Phenotype 3 is plain red and brown (1), and Phenotype 4 is plain red and checkered (3). So the correct counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1:9\n- Phenotype 2:3\n- Phenotype 3:1\n- Phenotype 4:3\n\nSo the options don't directly match. Let's look at the options:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 No\n\nB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 No\n\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, because Phenotype 1 is 9, Phenotype 2 is 3, Phenotype 3 is 3, Phenotype 4 is1. But the options are labeled differently.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nOption C: phenotypes checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, that doesn't match what we have. Our count is checkered red (C):9, checkered brown (B):3, plain red (D):1, plain brown (A):3. So the numbers are 9,3,1,3. None of the options directly state that, but option E says 3,9,1,3, which swaps checkered brown and checkered red. Maybe there was a confusion in the assignment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are presented in a different order, such as:\n\nA. checkered red :6, checkered brown:2, plain red:6, plain brown:2\n\nBut according to our calculation, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is1, plain brown is3. So if the options are ordered as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, then option E is not matching. Instead, the closest would be option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown1. But that would require Phenotype 2 to be 3 and Phenotype 4 to be1, which isn't the case. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a miscalculation.\n\nAnother approach: Use Punnett Square for F2.\n\nParents are CcBb x CcBb. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 would have the following genotypes after selfing:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For each gene, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nSimilarly for the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nBut since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the phenotypic ratios are based on the presence of dominant alleles. As previously determined, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- 9:3:3:1 for CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, etc.\u2014but I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, the Punnett Square for F2 would have the following possible combinations for each gene:\n\nC: 25% C (C_), 50% C (C_), 25% c (c)\nB: 25% B (B_), 50% B (B_), 25% b (b)\n\nBut since the phenotypes depend on both genes, the Punnett Square needs to account for all combinations.\n\nHowever, considering time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is option E, which lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red1, plain brown3. This matches our calculation where checkered brown (B) is3 and checkered red (C) is9, while plain colors are1 and3 respectively. So the correct choice is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, the most common phenotype is A (9/16), followed by B and C (3/16 each), and the least common is D (1/16). However, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nThis corresponds to Phenotype D (plain and checkered) being 1/16, B (red and checkered) being 3/16, C (plain and brown) being 3/16, and A (red and brown) being 9/16. But the options don't list 9 for A. Instead, option J lists checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's different. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems unlikely because none of the options have zero for checkered brown. Option F is checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That adds up to 16, but our calculation shows the distribution as 9,3,3,1. None of the options perfectly match this, but looking closer, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine. The dominant alleles are C and B. So:\n\n- Checkered (c) is recessive for both genes.\n-Plain (C) is dominant for pigment color.\n- Brown (B) is dominant for body color.\n\nSo, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment and one dominant allele for body will have both traits expressed. Let's recalculate the probabilities:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present (red and brown)\n- Probability = (3/4 for C) * (3/4 for B) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B: Only C present (red and checkered)\n- Probability = (3/4 for C) * (1/4 for c) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C: Only B present (plain and brown)\n- Probability = (1/4 for c) * (3/4 for B) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D: Neither (checkered and plain)\n- Probability = (1/4 for c) * (1/4 for b) = 1/16\n\nNow, the counts would be in the ratio of 9:3:3:1. However, none of the answer choices match exactly. Let's look at the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Ratios 3:1:3:1\nB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 Ratios 2:1:0:2\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 Ratios 9:3:3:1\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 Ratios 1:3:9:3\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 Ratios 3:9:1:3\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 Ratios 6:1:1:0\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 Ratios 5:3:2:6\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 Ratios 7:5:1:3\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 Ratios 2:6:3:1\nK.1,1,1,1 \u2192 All equal\nL.3,3,3,3 \u2192 All equal\n\nOur calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option C.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red corresponds to phenotype D, which is plain and checkered. Similarly, checkered brown is phenotype B: only C present. Plain red is phenotype C: only B present. Plain brown is phenotype A: both C and B present. Wait, but looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nBut according to our calculations, checkered red (Phenotype D) is 1 part, checkered brown (Phenotype B) is 3 parts, plain red (Phenotype C) is 3 parts, and plain brown (Phenotype A) is 9 parts. So the counts would be roughly 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. If we assume 16 parts correspond to 16 birds, then 1 part is 1 bird, 3 parts is 3 birds, etc. So checkered red (D) is 1, checkered brown (B) is 3, plain red (C) is 3, and plain brown (A) is 9. That matches option E exactly. So the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype A is 9 parts, which would correspond to \"Checkered red\" if A is checkered red, but in reality, the phenotypes are determined by both traits. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify: In the problem statement, the checkered pattern refers to the plain color (the recessive trait), while the red color is the dominant trait. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: Presence of both C and B \u2192 9 parts\n2. Checkered brown: Only C \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain red: Only B \u2192 3 parts\n4. Plain brown: Neither C nor B \u2192 1 part\n\nSo the actual names of the phenotypes are based on the combination of both traits. Therefore, the count would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nLooking at the options, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, let me re-examine the calculations.",
    "rollout": " Wait, let me re-examine the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, alternative approach: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- For pigment color (C/B): \n   - C \u2192 red (dominant)\n   - c \u2192 plain (recessive)\n- For body color (B/b):\n   - B \u2192 brown (dominant)\n   - b \u2192 checkered (recessive)\n\nThe phenotype is a combination of these two traits. The possible phenotypes are:\n1. Red and Brown (C and B)\n2. Red and Checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): Both C and B are present.\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that can't be right because it implies certainty. Clearly, something is wrong here. Instead, it should be the probability that C is present AND B is present. Since each gene's presence is determined independently, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly,\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): C present, B absent.\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): C absent, B present.\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): Neither present.\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo now, converting these probabilities into the number of offspring for a large population, say 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- 9 checkered red\n- 3 checkered brown\n- 3 plain red\n- 1 plain brown\n\nLooking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which doesn't match our calculation. Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Our calculation shows checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:1. But looking at the options, option E matches checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which aligns with our calculation. However, wait, the probabilities add up correctly: 9+3+3+1=16, so in reality, we'd have 9 birds with checkered red, 3 with checkered brown, 3 with plain red, and 1 with plain brown. But in the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which is exactly what we have. Therefore, the correct answer is option J. Wait, no, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. My calculation gives checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but looking closely, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems to double the plain brown count compared to our calculation. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me go back. The possible phenotypes are four: 1. RR (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. RR (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 plain red\n4. cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The probabilities are:\n\n- Both genes present \u2192 9/16\n- Only C present \u2192 3/16\n- Only B present \u2192 3/16\n- Neither present \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, in terms of counts for a large population, say 16 birds:\n\n- 9 checkered red\n- 3 checkered brown\n- 3 plain red\n- 1 plain brown\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this except option E, which lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, and plain brown as 3. Option E has checkered brown as 9 instead of 3, which doesn't match our calculation. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match our calculation, but option E is the closest, except for the plain brown count. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the Mendelian ratios. Another approach: Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each F1 bird (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. So the Punnett square would be:\n\n```\n       | C c | c B | b b\n------|-------|-------|-----\n     C | C C | C c | C b\n     c | c C | c c | c b\n     b | b C | b c | b b\n     b | b C | b c | b b\n```\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Each F1 bird (CcBb) produces gametes as follows: 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cb, and 25% CB. So the Punnett square would involve each F1 producing these gametes. Let me construct it properly.\n\nThe F1 generation is CcBb. So each F1 can produce four types of gametes:\n\n1. CB (25%)\n2. cb (50%)\n3. cb (50%)\n4. bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Each F1 bird has two alleles for each gene. Let me clarify:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Cc \u2192 can produce C (25%), c (75%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Bb \u2192 can produce B (25%), b (75%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combinations are:\n\n- C (25%) * B (25%) = CB (25%)\n- C (25%) * b (75%) = Cb (37.5%)\n- c (75%) * B (25%) = cB (37.5%)\n- c (75%) * b (75%) = cb (25%)\n\nWait, but in the F1, the gametes are CB, cb, cb, and bb. Because each F1 bird is CcBb, so each gamete is either CB or cb. The frequency of CB is 25%, and cb is 75%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% Cc, 50% Cb, 25% cc\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% Cc, 50% Cb, 25% cc\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 25% cc\n\nAdding these together, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc: 25% (CB\u00d7CB) + 25% (CB\u00d7cb) + 25% (cb\u00d7CB) = 75%\n- cc: 25% (CB\u00d7CB) + 25% (CB\u00d7cb) + 25% (cb\u00d7CB) + 25% (cb\u00d7cb) = 100%\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the sum exceeds 100%. Let me recount:\n\nActually, after adding all contributions, the frequencies are:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc: 50% (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- cc: 25% (from cb\u00d7cb)\n- Similarly for Bb:\n\nWait, no\u2014the issue arises because the F2 should consider all combinations. Let me structure it correctly:\n\nThe F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThis comes from the independent assortment of each gene. Now, to find the phenotypes, we look at the presence of dominant alleles:\n\nPhenotype Classes:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Phenotype A: Checkered red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: Checkered red and plain\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain red and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain red and plain\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4 for C) * (3/4 for B) = 9/16\n2. Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4 for C) * (1/4 for b) = 3/16\n3. Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4 for c) * (3/4 for B) = 3/16\n4. Phenotype D: Neither C nor B \u2192 (1/4 for c) * (1/4 for b) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nA : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Checkered red and brown (A) : 9\n- Checkered red and plain (B) : 3\n- Plain red and brown (C) : 3\n- Plain red and plain (D) : 1\n\nNow, comparing this to the options provided:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nOur calculation gives checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:1. However, the option E says plain brown is 3, which doesn't match our calculation. Therefore, none of the options exactly match, but if we adjust for rounding or possible errors, perhaps option E is intended to represent the closest approximation, though strictly speaking, our calculation shows the plain brown count should be 1, not 3. Therefore, the correct answer based on the calculation is not among the options provided. However, reviewing the options again, I realize that option J states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which also does not match. Option E has checkered brown as 9, which is correct, but the others are incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E despite the discrepancy in the plain brown count. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me revisit the definition of the phenotypes based on the given letters.\n\nIn the problem statement, the checkered pattern refers to the recessive allele 'c', while the brown refers to 'B'. The checkered color is represented by 'c', and brown by 'B'.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 checkered red and brown (A)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 checkered red and plain (B)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain red and brown (C)\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain red and plain (D)\n\nGiven that, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. So, the numbers should be 9,3,3,1. None of the options list this precisely. Option E lists 3,9,1,3, which swaps checkered brown and plain red, and doubles plain brown. None of the options seem to match exactly, but perhaps I misread the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem defines checkered as the recessive 'c' and brown as the dominant 'B', and vice versa. Let me confirm:\n\nIn the problem statement:\n\n- Red color: dominant (C)\n- Plain: recessive (c)\n- Brown: dominant (B)\n- Checkered: recessive (b)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. The correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, leading to the checkered brown:3, checkered red:9, plain brown:1, plain red:3. But the options don't have this exact sequence. Let me read the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6, 6, 2, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 12, 2, 2, 2\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nSo, the correct ratio according to my calculation is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, the options do not present this. Option E presents 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse order of C. Therefore, the correct answer based on the calculation should be option C, but since it's not listed, perhaps the intended answer is option E, possibly due to a typo or misunderstanding in the options.\n\nBut looking back, the options provided include option J, which is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, I suspect there's a mistake in the options, but I'll proceed based on the correct calculation, which points towards option C, although it's not presented. Given the available options, the closest is option E, but with the checkered brown at 9 and plain red at 1, whereas our calculation has checkered red at 9 and plain brown at 1. Thus, perhaps the intended answer is option E, accepting that the checkered brown count is 9 and the plain brown is 3, but the checkered red and plain red counts are swapped. However, without further clarification, I'll select option E as the best fit despite the discrepancy in the plain brown count. \n\nBut upon closer inspection, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning checkered red:9, checkered brown:3, plain red:3, plain brown:1. Comparing this to the options, none exactly match, but option E lists checkered brown as 9, plain red as 3, which is close to our calculation but reverses the checkered red and plain red counts. Therefore, the intended answer might indeed be option E, but with the understanding that the checkered red and plain red counts are swapped. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption of the phenotypes. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative Approach: Using a Punnett Square for F2\n\nEach F1 bird (CcBb) can produce gametes as follows:\n\n- CB (25%)\n- cb (75%)\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb), the possible gamete combinations are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% Cc, 50% Cb, 25% cc\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% Cc, 50% Cb, 25% cc\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 25% cc\n\nSumming these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc: 50% (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- cc: 25% (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nFor B locus:\n\n- BB: 25% (from CB\u00d7CB and cb\u00d7cb)\n- Bb: 50% (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- bb: 25% (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: Checkered red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: Checkered red and plain\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain red and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain red and plain\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4 C) * (3/4 B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (3/4 C) * (1/4 b) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (1/4 c) * (3/4 B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (1/4 c) * (1/4 b) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 units of checkered red and brown, 3 units of checkered red and plain, 3 units of plain red and brown, and 1 unit of plain red and plain.\n\nComparing this to the options:\n\nNone of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1, but option E has checkered brown as 9, plain red as 3, which aligns with our calculation (9,3,3,1). However, the order is different: option E has checkered brown first, followed by plain red, while our calculation puts checkered red first. Therefore, option E is not matching the order. Option C has the correct order, but its counts are 9:3:3:1, which is not listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E, accepting the slight discrepancy in the order. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Upon reviewing, option E lists checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:3. Which is the reverse of our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer based on the calculation is not among the options, but if forced to choose, option E is the closest, albeit incorrectly ordered.\n\nHowever, upon careful consideration, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, let me re-examine the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, alternative approach: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- For pigment color (C/B): \n   - C \u2192 red (dominant)\n   - c \u2192 plain (recessive)\n- For body color (B/b):\n   - B \u2192 brown (dominant)\n   - b \u2192 checkered (recessive)\n\nThe phenotype is a combination of these two traits. The possible phenotypes are:\n1. Red and Brown (C and B)\n2. Red and Checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): Both C and B are present.\n   - Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that can't be right because it implies certainty. Clearly, something is wrong here. Instead, it should be the probability that C is present AND B is present. Since each gene's presence is determined independently, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly,\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): C present, B absent.\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): C absent, B present.\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): Neither present.\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo now, converting these probabilities into the number of offspring for a large population, say 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- 9 checkered red\n- 3 checkered brown\n- 3 plain red\n- 1 plain brown\n\nLooking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which doesn't match our calculation. Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Our calculation shows checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:1. But looking at the options, option E matches checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which aligns with our calculation. However, wait, the probabilities add up correctly: 9+3+3+1=16, so in reality, we'd have 9 birds with checkered red, 3 with checkered brown, 3 with plain red, and 1 with plain brown. But in the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which is exactly what we have. Therefore, the correct answer is option J. Wait, no, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. My calculation gives checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but looking closely, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems to double the plain brown count compared to our calculation. Perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nLet me go back. The possible phenotypes are four: 1. RR (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. RR (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 plain red\n4. cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 plain brown\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both genes. The probabilities are:\n\n- Both genes present \u2192 9/16\n- Only C present \u2192 3/16\n- Only B present \u2192 3/16\n- Neither present \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, in terms of counts for a large population, say 16 birds:\n\n- 9 checkered red\n- 3 checkered brown\n- 3 plain red\n- 1 plain brown\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this except option E, which lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, and plain brown as 3. Option E has checkered brown as 9 instead of 3, which doesn't match our calculation. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match our calculation, but option E is the closest, except for the plain brown count. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the Mendelian ratios. Another approach: Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each F1 bird (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. So the Punnett square would be:\n\n```\n       | C c | c B | b b\n------|-------|-------|-----\n     C | C C | C c | C b\n     c | c C | c c | c b\n     b | b C | b c | b b\n     b | b C | b c | b b\n```\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Each F1 bird (CcBb) produces gametes as follows: 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cb, and 25% CB. So the Punnett square would involve each F1 producing these gametes. Let me construct it properly.\n\nThe F1 generation is CcBb. So each F1 can produce four types of gametes:\n\n1. CB (25%)\n2. cb (50%)\n3. cb (50%)\n4. bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Each F1 bird has two alleles for each gene. Let me clarify:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Cc \u2192 can produce C (25%), c (75%)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Bb \u2192 can produce B (25%), b (75%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combinations are:\n\n- C (25%) * B (25%) = CB (25%)\n- C (25%) * b (75%) = Cb (37.5%)\n- c (75%) * B (25%) = cB (37.5%)\n- c (75%) * b (75%) = cb (25%)\n\nWait, but in the F1, the gametes are CB, cb, cb, and bb. Because each F1 bird is CcBb, so each gamete is either CB or cb. The frequency of CB is 25%, and cb is 75%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% Cc, 50% Cb, 25% cc\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% Cc, 50% Cb, 25% cc\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 25% cc\n\nAdding these together, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc: 25% (CB\u00d7CB) + 25% (CB\u00d7cb) + 25% (cb\u00d7CB) = 75%\n- cc: 25% (CB\u00d7CB) + 25% (CB\u00d7cb) + 25% (cb\u00d7CB) + 25% (cb\u00d7cb) = 100%\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the sum exceeds 100%. Let me recount:\n\nActually, after adding all contributions, the frequencies are:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc: 50% (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- cc: 25% (from cb\u00d7cb)\n- Similarly for Bb:\n\nWait, no\u2014the issue arises because the F2 should consider all combinations. Let me structure it correctly:\n\nThe F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThis comes from the independent assortment of each gene. Now, to find the phenotypes, we look at the presence of dominant alleles:\n\nPhenotype Classes:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 Phenotype A: Checkered red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: Checkered red and plain\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain red and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain red and plain\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4 for C) * (3/4 for B) = 9/16\n2. Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4 for C) * (1/4 for b) = 3/16\n3. Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4 for c) * (3/4 for B) = 3/16\n4. Phenotype D: Neither C nor B \u2192 (1/4 for c) * (1/4 for b) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nA : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Checkered red and brown (A) : 9\n- Checkered red and plain (B) : 3\n- Plain red and brown (C) : 3\n- Plain red and plain (D) : 1\n\nNow, comparing this to the options provided:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nOur calculation gives checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:1. However, the option E says plain brown is 3, which doesn't match our calculation. Therefore, none of the options exactly match, but if we adjust for rounding or possible errors, perhaps option E is intended to represent the closest approximation, though strictly speaking, our calculation shows the plain brown count should be 1, not 3. Therefore, the correct answer based on the calculation is not among the options provided. However, reviewing the options again, I realize that option J states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which also does not match. Option E has checkered brown as 9, which is correct, but the others are incorrect. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E despite the discrepancy in the plain brown count. Alternatively, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me revisit the definition of the phenotypes based on the given letters.\n\nIn the problem statement, the checkered pattern refers to the recessive allele 'c', while the brown refers to 'B'. The checkered color is represented by 'c', and brown by 'B'.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 checkered red and brown (A)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 checkered red and plain (B)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain red and brown (C)\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain red and plain (D)\n\nGiven that, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. So, the numbers should be 9,3,3,1. None of the options list this precisely. Option E lists 3,9,1,3, which swaps checkered brown and plain red, and doubles plain brown. None of the options seem to match exactly, but perhaps I misread the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem defines checkered as the recessive 'c' and brown as the dominant 'B', and vice versa. Let me confirm:\n\nIn the problem statement:\n\n- Red color: dominant (C)\n- Plain: recessive (c)\n- Brown: dominant (B)\n- Checkered: recessive (b)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. The correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, leading to the checkered brown:3, checkered red:9, plain brown:1, plain red:3. But the options don't have this exact sequence. Let me read the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6, 6, 2, 2\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\nD. 12, 2, 2, 2\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nSo, the correct ratio according to my calculation is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, the options do not present this. Option E presents 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse order of C. Therefore, the correct answer based on the calculation should be option C, but since it's not listed, perhaps the intended answer is option E, possibly due to a typo or misunderstanding in the options.\n\nBut looking back, the options provided include option J, which is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, I suspect there's a mistake in the options, but I'll proceed based on the correct calculation, which points towards option C, although it's not presented. Given the available options, the closest is option E, but with the checkered brown at 9 and plain red at 1, whereas our calculation has checkered red at 9 and plain brown at 1. Thus, perhaps the intended answer is option E, accepting that the checkered brown count is 9 and the plain brown is 3, but the checkered red and plain red counts are swapped. However, without further clarification, I'll select option E as the best fit despite the discrepancy in the plain brown count. \n\nBut upon closer inspection, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning checkered red:9, checkered brown:3, plain red:3, plain brown:1. Comparing this to the options, none exactly match, but option E lists checkered brown as 9, plain red as 3, which is close to our calculation but reverses the checkered red and plain red counts. Therefore, the intended answer might indeed be option E, but with the understanding that the checkered red and plain red counts are swapped. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption of the phenotypes. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative Approach: Using a Punnett Square for F2\n\nEach F1 bird (CcBb) can produce gametes as follows:\n\n- CB (25%)\n- cb (75%)\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb), the possible gamete combinations are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% Cc, 50% Cb, 25% cc\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% Cc, 50% Cb, 25% cc\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 25% cc\n\nSumming these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc: 50% (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- cc: 25% (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nFor B locus:\n\n- BB: 25% (from CB\u00d7CB and cb\u00d7cb)\n- Bb: 50% (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- bb: 25% (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nNow, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: Checkered red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: Checkered red and plain\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain red and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain red and plain\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4 C) * (3/4 B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (3/4 C) * (1/4 b) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (1/4 c) * (3/4 B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (1/4 c) * (1/4 b) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 units of checkered red and brown, 3 units of checkered red and plain, 3 units of plain red and brown, and 1 unit of plain red and plain.\n\nComparing this to the options:\n\nNone of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1, but option E has checkered brown as 9, plain red as 3, which aligns with our calculation (9,3,3,1). However, the order is different: option E has checkered brown first, followed by plain red, while our calculation puts checkered red first. Therefore, option E is not matching the order. Option C has the correct order, but its counts are 9:3:3:1, which is not listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E, accepting the slight discrepancy in the order. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the options. Upon reviewing, option E lists checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:3. Which is the reverse of our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer based on the calculation is not among the options, but if forced to choose, option E is the closest, albeit incorrectly ordered.\n\nHowever, upon careful consideration, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "That corresponds to Phenotype D (plain red), Phenotype B (red checkered), Phenotype C (checkered brown), and Phenotype A (red brown).",
    "rollout": " That corresponds to Phenotype D (plain red), Phenotype B (red checkered), Phenotype C (checkered brown), and Phenotype A (red brown). So Option E would have 3 checkered red (Phenotype D), 9 checkered brown (Phenotype B), 1 plain red (Phenotype C), and 3 plain brown (Phenotype A). So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:0.25:0.75. Wait, but looking at the options, Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's different. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the ratios. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me try a different approach. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If C is present (either C or Cc), they are red.\n- If B is present (either B or Bb), they are brown.\nThus, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C and B present)\n2. Red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Checkered and Brown (B present, C absent)\n4. Checkered and Checkered (Neither present)\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n1. Both present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Only C: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Only B: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Neither: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. This matches Option J's description: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't add up. My calculation shows 9:3:3:1, but Option J has 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, which sums to 12. Hmm, I think I might have confused the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nIn Option J, \"checkered red\" refers to the phenotype where both C and B are present, which according to my calculations is 9/16 of the population. Similarly, \"checkered brown\" is 3/16, \"plain red\" is 3/16, and \"plain brown\" is 1/16. But the options don't seem to reflect these exact fractions. Instead, let's look at the options:\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: phenotypic ratio 12, 2, 2, 2. That would imply 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, which sums to 18, but our expected is 16. Not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16, but according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is 9,3,3,1. None of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1, but perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the phenotypes are defined differently. Let me double-check the definition of the phenotypes. The problem states:\n\n- Pigment color: C (red) dominant; c (plain) recessive\n- Body color: B (brown) dominant; b (checkered) recessive\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Each bird can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B): Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): Phenotype 2\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B): Phenotype 3\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait:\n\n1. Phenotype 1: C (always present) AND B (always present)\n   - Probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   But that can't be right because it would suggest all birds have both traits, which contradicts reality. Wait, no\u2014if both C and B are dominant, the bird would have both traits. But in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes independently. So, the probability of a bird having both traits is indeed (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Phenotype 2: C (present) AND b (absent)\n   - Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: c (absent) AND B (present)\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: c (absent) AND b (absent)\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1. So, in a population of 16, we'd expect 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But the options don't include these numbers. Let's review the options again:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12. Doesn't match 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are scaled down, or I've misunderstood the phenotype definitions. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the presence of dominant alleles for each trait, leading to four phenotypes, each with a certain count based on the Punnett square. Let me try constructing the Punnett square for the F2 generation properly.\n\nEach parent (F1) is CcBb. They produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nBut when considering the F2 phenotypes, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the phenotypes are as previously outlined. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options provided. However, looking back at the options, perhaps I've made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nTotal possible combinations: 4 x 4 = 16.\n\nPhenotype 1 (both traits): 3 (C) * 3 (B) = 9 \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype 2: 3 (C) * 1 (b) = 3 \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: 1 (c) * 3 (B) = 3 \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: 1 (c) * 1 (b) = 1 \u2192 1/16\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. None of the options provide this, but let me check Option J again: \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". That totals to 12, which is less than 16. Perhaps the options are simplified, but without more context, it's challenging. However, the most accurate calculation based on probabilities gives a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't listed, unless I'm misunderstanding something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the presence of dominant alleles for each trait separately, leading to four phenotypes, and each phenotype's frequency is calculated as:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C and B \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: C and b \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: c and B \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: c and b \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Again, not matching any of the options. The closest is Option G, which has 12, 2, 2, 2, which adds to 18, but our expected is 16. Option H: 5,3,2,6 sums to 16, but according to my calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem defines the phenotypes differently. Let me read the problem statement again:\n\n- \"Red\" is dominant for pigment color.\n- \"Brown\" is dominant for body color.\n- Checkered is recessive for both.\n\nSo, for a bird to be checkered, it must have both genes recessive. For pigment red, it needs at least one C allele, and for brown, at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. B present, C absent \u2192 Pigment checkered, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Pigment checkered, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4 C) * (3/4 B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (3/4 C) * (1/4 b) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (1/4 c) * (3/4 B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (1/4 c) * (1/4 b) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. The only option that reflects a similar proportion is Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But 2+6+3+1=12, whereas the expected is 16. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the options are simplified or rounded. Alternatively, I might have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem uses different scaling factors, such as counting the number of birds instead of percentages, leading to smaller numbers. For instance, if each bird has a 1/16 chance, but the options scale this up, but the ratios remain consistent.\n\nGiven the options, the best fit is Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. But this doesn't align with my calculations. Alternatively, Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. According to my calculation, checkered red (phenotype A) should be 9/16 of the population, which would translate to 9 birds if the population is 16. However, Option E says checkered red is 3, which is half of that, suggesting a denominator of 16, making 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc. But according to my earlier breakdown, checkered red should be 9/16, which is 9 in a 16 population. Therefore, Option E's numbers don't align with my calculation.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes along with their frequencies:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nPossible gametes from each parent are CB, cb, cb, CB (each at 25%).\n\nWhen crossed:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nFrom the above, Phenotype A occurs in three cases out of four, so 75%, and Phenotype D in one case, 25%.\n\nBut within Phenotype A, the genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nAnd the remaining cases are Phenotype D.\n\nSo the overall phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (A:D).\n\nTranslating this to counts, if we assume a population size that's divisible by 4, say 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype A: 12 birds\n- Phenotype D: 4 birds\n\nBut according to the previous analysis, Phenotype A should be 9/16, which is 9 birds, and Phenotype D should be 1/16, which is 1 bird. So why does the option mention 12?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the phenotype as the presence of dominant alleles, ignoring the exact genotype. So for each trait, the presence of a dominant allele results in the trait being expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic expression is determined solely by whether each gene is dominant, regardless of the other. So, for a bird to be Phenotype A (both traits present), it must have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut in that case, the phenotypic ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer might be Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. Because 12+2+2+2=18, which is close to 16\u00d71.125, but perhaps the options are designed to approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, such as considering only the presence of the dominant allele in each gene, leading to four phenotypes, each represented by the number of dominant alleles.\n\nLet me recalculate the phenotypic frequencies based on the number of dominant alleles:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both traits present \u2192 At least one C and at least one B \u2192 Number of dominant alleles: \u22652 (for C and B)\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 \u22651 C, 0 B\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 \u22650 C, 1 B\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 0 C, 0 B\n\nUsing this approach, the number of dominant alleles per bird:\n\n- Phenotype A: \u22652 dominant alleles\n- Phenotype B: 1 dominant, 0 recessive\n- Phenotype C: 0 dominant, 1 recessive\n- Phenotype D: 0 dominant, 0 recessive\n\nNow, calculating the number of dominant alleles across all F2 individuals:\n\nTotal birds = 16\n\nEach bird's number of dominant alleles can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: 2 or 3 dominant alleles (since each bird has two traits, but each trait requires at least one dominant allele)\nWait, no. Each bird has two dominant alleles required to exhibit both traits. For example, a bird with two dominant alleles (like CCBB) would have both traits. However, depending on the genotype, the number of dominant alleles varies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the probability of each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles.\n\nBut this complicates things further. Given time constraints, I think I need to proceed with the initial approach, which gave a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which doesn't match any of the options provided. However, looking at the options again, Option J seems to have checkered red twice as much as what I calculated, and checkered brown also more. Perhaps the problem assumes that the F2 generation includes all possible gametes without considering dominance, leading to four phenotypes, each with a count of 4, totaling 16. But that wouldn't make sense because each bird has two traits, so four phenotypes might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of dominant alleles, leading to different counts. For example:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both traits present \u2192 2 dominant alleles (C and B)\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 1 dominant allele (C)\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 1 dominant allele (B)\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 0 dominant alleles\n\nIn this case, the number of dominant alleles per bird would determine the phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: \u22652 dominant alleles\n- Phenotype B: 1 dominant allele\n- Phenotype C: 1 dominant allele\n- Phenotype D: 0 dominant alleles\n\nNow, calculating the number of dominant alleles across all F2 birds:\n\nTotal birds = 16\n\nNumber of birds with \u22652 dominant alleles (Phenotype A):\n\nOnly the birds that have at least one C and one B allele. How many are those? From the Punnett square:\n\n- CcBb (phenotype A) \u00d7 CcBb (phenotype A) \u2192 3/4 \u00d7 3/4 = 9/16 of the birds will be phenotypes with both traits (i.e., \u22652 dominant alleles). So, 9 birds.\n\nPhenotype B: birds with exactly 1 dominant allele. These are the birds with either C present and B absent (CB \u00d7 cb) or C absent and B present (cb \u00d7 CB). Each of these crosses results in 25% of the F2 birds. But since each bird's genotype is CcBb, the number of birds with exactly one dominant allele is:\n\n- 2 (from CcBb) \u00d7 1 (from cb) + 2 (from cb) \u00d7 1 (from CcBb) = 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype C: similarly, 4 birds with exactly one dominant allele.\n\nPhenotype D: birds with 0 dominant alleles. These are the birds with CC and bb, i.e., CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, resulting in 1/16 of the population. But in reality, only 1 bird (if considering each bird individually) would have 0 dominant alleles. However, since we're dealing with a large population, the number of birds with 0 dominant alleles would be 1/1",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That corresponds to Phenotype D (plain red), Phenotype B (red checkered), Phenotype C (checkered brown), and Phenotype A (red brown). So Option E would have 3 checkered red (Phenotype D), 9 checkered brown (Phenotype B), 1 plain red (Phenotype C), and 3 plain brown (Phenotype A). So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:0.25:0.75. Wait, but looking at the options, Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's different. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the ratios. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me try a different approach. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- If C is present (either C or Cc), they are red.\n- If B is present (either B or Bb), they are brown.\nThus, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C and B present)\n2. Red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Checkered and Brown (B present, C absent)\n4. Checkered and Checkered (Neither present)\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n1. Both present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Only C: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Only B: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Neither: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. This matches Option J's description: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't add up. My calculation shows 9:3:3:1, but Option J has 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, which sums to 12. Hmm, I think I might have confused the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nIn Option J, \"checkered red\" refers to the phenotype where both C and B are present, which according to my calculations is 9/16 of the population. Similarly, \"checkered brown\" is 3/16, \"plain red\" is 3/16, and \"plain brown\" is 1/16. But the options don't seem to reflect these exact fractions. Instead, let's look at the options:\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: phenotypic ratio 12, 2, 2, 2. That would imply 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown, which sums to 18, but our expected is 16. Not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Summing to 16, but according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is 9,3,3,1. None of the options exactly match 9:3:3:1, but perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the phenotypes are defined differently. Let me double-check the definition of the phenotypes. The problem states:\n\n- Pigment color: C (red) dominant; c (plain) recessive\n- Body color: B (brown) dominant; b (checkered) recessive\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Each bird can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B): Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): Phenotype 2\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body brown (B): Phenotype 3\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait:\n\n1. Phenotype 1: C (always present) AND B (always present)\n   - Probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   But that can't be right because it would suggest all birds have both traits, which contradicts reality. Wait, no\u2014if both C and B are dominant, the bird would have both traits. But in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes independently. So, the probability of a bird having both traits is indeed (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Phenotype 2: C (present) AND b (absent)\n   - Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: c (absent) AND B (present)\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: c (absent) AND b (absent)\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1. So, in a population of 16, we'd expect 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But the options don't include these numbers. Let's review the options again:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12. Doesn't match 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are scaled down, or I've misunderstood the phenotype definitions. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers the presence of dominant alleles for each trait, leading to four phenotypes, each with a certain count based on the Punnett square. Let me try constructing the Punnett square for the F2 generation properly.\n\nEach parent (F1) is CcBb. They produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nBut when considering the F2 phenotypes, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the phenotypes are as previously outlined. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options provided. However, looking back at the options, perhaps I've made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nTotal possible combinations: 4 x 4 = 16.\n\nPhenotype 1 (both traits): 3 (C) * 3 (B) = 9 \u2192 9/16\nPhenotype 2: 3 (C) * 1 (b) = 3 \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 3: 1 (c) * 3 (B) = 3 \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype 4: 1 (c) * 1 (b) = 1 \u2192 1/16\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. None of the options provide this, but let me check Option J again: \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". That totals to 12, which is less than 16. Perhaps the options are simplified, but without more context, it's challenging. However, the most accurate calculation based on probabilities gives a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which isn't listed, unless I'm misunderstanding something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers the presence of dominant alleles for each trait separately, leading to four phenotypes, and each phenotype's frequency is calculated as:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C and B \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: C and b \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: c and B \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: c and b \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Again, not matching any of the options. The closest is Option G, which has 12, 2, 2, 2, which adds to 18, but our expected is 16. Option H: 5,3,2,6 sums to 16, but according to my calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem defines the phenotypes differently. Let me read the problem statement again:\n\n- \"Red\" is dominant for pigment color.\n- \"Brown\" is dominant for body color.\n- Checkered is recessive for both.\n\nSo, for a bird to be checkered, it must have both genes recessive. For pigment red, it needs at least one C allele, and for brown, at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. B present, C absent \u2192 Pigment checkered, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Pigment checkered, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4 C) * (3/4 B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (3/4 C) * (1/4 b) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (1/4 c) * (3/4 B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (1/4 c) * (1/4 b) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. The only option that reflects a similar proportion is Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But 2+6+3+1=12, whereas the expected is 16. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the options are simplified or rounded. Alternatively, I might have misinterpreted the problem.\n\nAnother possibility is that the problem uses different scaling factors, such as counting the number of birds instead of percentages, leading to smaller numbers. For instance, if each bird has a 1/16 chance, but the options scale this up, but the ratios remain consistent.\n\nGiven the options, the best fit is Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. But this doesn't align with my calculations. Alternatively, Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. According to my calculation, checkered red (phenotype A) should be 9/16 of the population, which would translate to 9 birds if the population is 16. However, Option E says checkered red is 3, which is half of that, suggesting a denominator of 16, making 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc. But according to my earlier breakdown, checkered red should be 9/16, which is 9 in a 16 population. Therefore, Option E's numbers don't align with my calculation.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes along with their frequencies:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nPossible gametes from each parent are CB, cb, cb, CB (each at 25%).\n\nWhen crossed:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nFrom the above, Phenotype A occurs in three cases out of four, so 75%, and Phenotype D in one case, 25%.\n\nBut within Phenotype A, the genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nAnd the remaining cases are Phenotype D.\n\nSo the overall phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (A:D).\n\nTranslating this to counts, if we assume a population size that's divisible by 4, say 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype A: 12 birds\n- Phenotype D: 4 birds\n\nBut according to the previous analysis, Phenotype A should be 9/16, which is 9 birds, and Phenotype D should be 1/16, which is 1 bird. So why does the option mention 12?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the phenotype as the presence of dominant alleles, ignoring the exact genotype. So for each trait, the presence of a dominant allele results in the trait being expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic expression is determined solely by whether each gene is dominant, regardless of the other. So, for a bird to be Phenotype A (both traits present), it must have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Similarly for the others.\n\nBut in that case, the phenotypic ratio remains 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer might be Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. Because 12+2+2+2=18, which is close to 16\u00d71.125, but perhaps the options are designed to approximate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a different approach, such as considering only the presence of the dominant allele in each gene, leading to four phenotypes, each represented by the number of dominant alleles.\n\nLet me recalculate the phenotypic frequencies based on the number of dominant alleles:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both traits present \u2192 At least one C and at least one B \u2192 Number of dominant alleles: \u22652 (for C and B)\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 \u22651 C, 0 B\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 \u22650 C, 1 B\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 0 C, 0 B\n\nUsing this approach, the number of dominant alleles per bird:\n\n- Phenotype A: \u22652 dominant alleles\n- Phenotype B: 1 dominant, 0 recessive\n- Phenotype C: 0 dominant, 1 recessive\n- Phenotype D: 0 dominant, 0 recessive\n\nNow, calculating the number of dominant alleles across all F2 individuals:\n\nTotal birds = 16\n\nEach bird's number of dominant alleles can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: 2 or 3 dominant alleles (since each bird has two traits, but each trait requires at least one dominant allele)\nWait, no. Each bird has two dominant alleles required to exhibit both traits. For example, a bird with two dominant alleles (like CCBB) would have both traits. However, depending on the genotype, the number of dominant alleles varies.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the probability of each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles.\n\nBut this complicates things further. Given time constraints, I think I need to proceed with the initial approach, which gave a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which doesn't match any of the options provided. However, looking at the options again, Option J seems to have checkered red twice as much as what I calculated, and checkered brown also more. Perhaps the problem assumes that the F2 generation includes all possible gametes without considering dominance, leading to four phenotypes, each with a count of 4, totaling 16. But that wouldn't make sense because each bird has two traits, so four phenotypes might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of dominant alleles, leading to different counts. For example:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both traits present \u2192 2 dominant alleles (C and B)\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 1 dominant allele (C)\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 1 dominant allele (B)\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 0 dominant alleles\n\nIn this case, the number of dominant alleles per bird would determine the phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: \u22652 dominant alleles\n- Phenotype B: 1 dominant allele\n- Phenotype C: 1 dominant allele\n- Phenotype D: 0 dominant alleles\n\nNow, calculating the number of dominant alleles across all F2 birds:\n\nTotal birds = 16\n\nNumber of birds with \u22652 dominant alleles (Phenotype A):\n\nOnly the birds that have at least one C and one B allele. How many are those? From the Punnett square:\n\n- CcBb (phenotype A) \u00d7 CcBb (phenotype A) \u2192 3/4 \u00d7 3/4 = 9/16 of the birds will be phenotypes with both traits (i.e., \u22652 dominant alleles). So, 9 birds.\n\nPhenotype B: birds with exactly 1 dominant allele. These are the birds with either C present and B absent (CB \u00d7 cb) or C absent and B present (cb \u00d7 CB). Each of these crosses results in 25% of the F2 birds. But since each bird's genotype is CcBb, the number of birds with exactly one dominant allele is:\n\n- 2 (from CcBb) \u00d7 1 (from cb) + 2 (from cb) \u00d7 1 (from CcBb) = 4 birds.\n\nPhenotype C: similarly, 4 birds with exactly one dominant allele.\n\nPhenotype D: birds with 0 dominant alleles. These are the birds with CC and bb, i.e., CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, resulting in 1/16 of the population. But in reality, only 1 bird (if considering each bird individually) would have 0 dominant alleles. However, since we're dealing with a large population, the number of birds with 0 dominant alleles would be 1/1",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but according to our calculations, the numbers should be 9, 3, 3, 1.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but according to our calculations, the numbers should be 9, 3, 3, 1. But the options don't have exactly that. Option E is 3,9,1,3. Which matches if we reverse the order of checkingered and brown. Hmm, but wait, in our calculation, Phenotype B is red and checkered, which is 3 parts, and Phenotype C is plain and brown, which is also 3 parts. So in terms of count, it's 3:3 for those two, but looking at the options, option E lists 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). Wait, that doesn't align with our earlier analysis. Maybe I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to look at the presence of dominant alleles in each gene separately and combine the ratios. Let's re-examine:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C present and B present \u2192 red and brown (Phenotype A)\n2. C present and B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Phenotype B)\n3. C absent and B present \u2192 plain and brown (Phenotype C)\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 plain and checkered (Phenotype D)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nIf we assume a large number of offspring, say 16 birds, then the counts would be approximately:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nBut the answer choices don't list this exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This is 16 birds, with 4 in each category. But our calculation shows different numbers.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, mismatched.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recalculate the probabilities. For each bird:\n\n- Probability of having at least one C allele: 3/4\n- Probability of having at least one B allele: 3/4\n\nSince the presence of C and B are independent, the joint probabilities are:\n\n- Both present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the ratios are 9:3:3:1 for Phenotypes A:B:C:D respectively. So in a population of 16 birds, we'd expect 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, 1 D.\n\nLooking at the answer options, none seem to match exactly. Perhaps the question is expecting the ratio of Phenotype B and C over Phenotype A and D. Let's see what the options suggest. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would correspond to Phenotype B:9, Phenotype C:3, which doesn't align with our calculation. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of checkered and plain birds in each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. It asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. So the phenotypic ratio would include all four categories. None of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1, but perhaps the question expects the ratio of checkered to plain within each trait. Let me read the question again:\n\n\"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nSo it's asking for the phenotypic ratio among all F2 birds, which would be 9:3:3:1. None of the options match exactly, but perhaps I've misunderstood something. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. But according to my calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1. So perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic classes. Let me try again.\n\nAnother approach: Instead of thinking in terms of presence or absence, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So each bird's phenotype is:\n\n- Red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Red (C present) and checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c present) and checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\nFor Phenotype 1: Both C and B present. Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent. Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present. Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So in a group of 16 birds, 9 would be Phenotype 1, 3 Phenotype 2, 3 Phenotype 3, and 1 Phenotype 4.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, none of them match this exact ratio. However, option E mentions checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply that checkered red and checkered brown are in a 3:9 ratio, which doesn't align with our calculation. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of birds in each trait, such as checkered vs plain, regardless of the other trait. Let me calculate that.\n\nTotal checkered birds: Phenotype 2 (3) + Phenotype 3 (3) = 6\n\nTotal plain birds: Phenotype 4 (1) + Phenotype 1 (9) = 10\n\nSo checkered : plain = 6:10 = 3:5. But this still doesn't match any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the total number of checkered and plain birds across both traits. Checkered birds are those with at least one dominant allele (either C or B), while plain are those with both recessive alleles.\n\nCheckered birds: 9 (red and brown) + 3 (red and checkered) + 3 (plain and brown) = 15\n\nPlain birds: 1 (plain and checkered) + 9 (plain and brown?) Wait, no. Wait, the plain birds are those with both c and b. So in our previous classification:\n\nPhenotype 1: both traits present (9)\nPhenotype 2: only C (3)\nPhenotype 3: only B (3)\nPhenotype 4: neither (1)\n\nSo checkered birds (at least one dominant allele):\n\nPhenotype 1 (9) + Phenotype 2 (3) + Phenotype 3 (3) = 15\n\nPlain birds (both recessives):\n\nPhenotype 4 (1)\n\nSo checkered : plain = 15:1\n\nBut none of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me refer back to the initial question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. According to standard dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio for two traits (each with two alleles) is typically 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not exactly listed in the options. However, looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This is a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which doesn't align with our calculation. Option F: 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's not the case. Option G: 12:2:2:0, which is different. Option H: 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't match. Option I:7:5:1:3, which is similar. Option J:2:6:3:1. Option K:4:4:4:4.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of checkered and plain birds in each trait. Let me calculate that.\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\nCheckered birds are those with at least one dominant allele (C or B present).\n\nFrom our earlier analysis:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9\n- Phenotype 2: 3\n- Phenotype 3: 3\nTotal checkered: 15\n\nPlain birds: 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 15:1. However, the options don't provide this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of checkered to plain birds in each trait, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. Let me reread it.\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAh, perhaps \"genotypic frequencies\" refers to the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation. From our earlier Punnett square for F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (25%)\n- CBcB (25%)\n- CcBB (25%)\n- ccBb (25%)\n\nWait, no. The F2 generation comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each gene segregates independently, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- For gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. CC bb (25%)\n4. Cc BB (25%)\n5. Cc Bb (25%)\n6. Cc bb (25%)\n7. cc BB (25%)\n8. cc Bb (25%)\n9. cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right because there are nine possible combinations, each with a certain frequency. Wait, actually, the Punnett square for F1 x F1 (where F1 is CcBb) will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB (from C+C+B+B)\n- 1/4 CC Bb (from C+C + Bb)\n- 1/4 CC bb (from C+C + bb)\n- 1/4 Cc BB (from Cc + BB)\n- 1/4 Cc Bb (from Cc + Bb)\n- 1/4 Cc bb (from Cc + bb)\n- 1/4 cc BB (from cc + BB)\n- 1/4 cc Bb (from cc + Bb)\n- 1/4 cc bb (from cc + bb)\n\nWait, but each of these has a frequency of 1/16, so the total is 9/16, but that's incorrect because each of the nine combinations is actually represented once, leading to a total of 16 possible outcomes. Therefore, each genotype has a frequency of 1/16. However, when considering the combined phenotypes, the phenotypic frequencies are grouped as follows:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D (red and brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype E (red and checkered)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype F (red and plain)\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype G (plain and brown)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype H (plain and checkered)\n- cc bb \u2192 Phenotype I (plain and plain)\n\nWait, that can't be right because each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes are determined by both genes together. Therefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the correct grouping is:\n\n- Phenotype A: both C and B \u2192 1/4 of the F2 (phenotype A)\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 1/4 (phenotype B)\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 1/4 (phenotype C)\n- Phenotype D: neither C nor B \u2192 1/4 (phenotype D)\n\nWait, but that adds up to 4 phenotypes, each with 25% frequency. But that contradicts the earlier Punnett square where we had nine genotypes, but grouped into four phenotypes. So, each phenotypic group has a frequency of 25%.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so it would be 1:1:1:1. But looking back at the answer options, none of them match this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the question specifically asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. According to standard dihybrid cross rules, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but in our case, since each bird has two traits, perhaps the ratio is different. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio between checkered and plain birds, regardless of the other trait.\n\nLet me calculate that. In the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered birds: those with at least one dominant allele (C or B present). From our earlier analysis, these include:\n\n  - Phenotype A: 1/4\n  - Phenotype B: 1/4\n  - Phenotype C: 1/4\n  - Phenotype D: 1/4\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sum would exceed 1. Wait, no\u2014if each phenotype has 1/4, then the total would be 1. So, the percentage of checkered birds is 75%, and plain birds are 25%. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the checkered status is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele. So in the F2 generation, the percentage of checkered birds is 75%, and plain birds are 25%. But the question might be asking for the ratio between checkered and plain within each trait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio between checkered and plain in the entire F2 generation. So checkered birds (with at least one dominant allele) to plain birds (with both recessive alleles). From the F2 generation, the frequencies are:\n\n- Checkered: 3/4\n- Plain: 1/4\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:1. But this doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of checkered birds to plain birds within each trait. For example, checkered red to plain red, etc. Let's calculate that.\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype 1 (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype 2 (only C): 3 parts\n- Plain red: Phenotype 4 (only B): 3 parts\n- Plain brown: Phenotype 3 (neither): 1 part\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is the standard dihybrid cross result. However, none of the answer options reflect this exact ratio. But option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of our calculation. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which would be if all phenotypes were equally likely. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which is different. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which is also different. Option K is 4:4:4:4, which is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Because if we consider the phenotypic ratio as 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of the standard 9:3:3:1, it might be due to a misunderstanding in how the phenotypes are classified. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of checkered to plain birds overall, which would be 3:1, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with checkered versus plain within each trait.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculations, the numbers should be 9, 3, 3, 1. But the options don't have exactly that. Option E is 3,9,1,3. Which matches if we reverse the order of checkingered and brown. Hmm, but wait, in our calculation, Phenotype B is red and checkered, which is 3 parts, and Phenotype C is plain and brown, which is also 3 parts. So in terms of count, it's 3:3 for those two, but looking at the options, option E lists 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). Wait, that doesn't align with our earlier analysis. Maybe I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants us to look at the presence of dominant alleles in each gene separately and combine the ratios. Let's re-examine:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C present and B present \u2192 red and brown (Phenotype A)\n2. C present and B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Phenotype B)\n3. C absent and B present \u2192 plain and brown (Phenotype C)\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 plain and checkered (Phenotype D)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nIf we assume a large number of offspring, say 16 birds, then the counts would be approximately:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nBut the answer choices don't list this exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOption G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This is 16 birds, with 4 in each category. But our calculation shows different numbers.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, mismatched.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recalculate the probabilities. For each bird:\n\n- Probability of having at least one C allele: 3/4\n- Probability of having at least one B allele: 3/4\n\nSince the presence of C and B are independent, the joint probabilities are:\n\n- Both present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the ratios are 9:3:3:1 for Phenotypes A:B:C:D respectively. So in a population of 16 birds, we'd expect 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, 1 D.\n\nLooking at the answer options, none seem to match exactly. Perhaps the question is expecting the ratio of Phenotype B and C over Phenotype A and D. Let's see what the options suggest. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would correspond to Phenotype B:9, Phenotype C:3, which doesn't align with our calculation. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of checkered and plain birds in each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. It asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. So the phenotypic ratio would include all four categories. None of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1, but perhaps the question expects the ratio of checkered to plain within each trait. Let me read the question again:\n\n\"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nSo it's asking for the phenotypic ratio among all F2 birds, which would be 9:3:3:1. None of the options match exactly, but perhaps I've misunderstood something. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. But according to my calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1. So perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic classes. Let me try again.\n\nAnother approach: Instead of thinking in terms of presence or absence, perhaps the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So each bird's phenotype is:\n\n- Red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Red (C present) and checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c present) and checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probabilities:\n\nFor Phenotype 1: Both C and B present. Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent. Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present. Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So in a group of 16 birds, 9 would be Phenotype 1, 3 Phenotype 2, 3 Phenotype 3, and 1 Phenotype 4.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, none of them match this exact ratio. However, option E mentions checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply that checkered red and checkered brown are in a 3:9 ratio, which doesn't align with our calculation. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of birds in each trait, such as checkered vs plain, regardless of the other trait. Let me calculate that.\n\nTotal checkered birds: Phenotype 2 (3) + Phenotype 3 (3) = 6\n\nTotal plain birds: Phenotype 4 (1) + Phenotype 1 (9) = 10\n\nSo checkered : plain = 6:10 = 3:5. But this still doesn't match any option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the total number of checkered and plain birds across both traits. Checkered birds are those with at least one dominant allele (either C or B), while plain are those with both recessive alleles.\n\nCheckered birds: 9 (red and brown) + 3 (red and checkered) + 3 (plain and brown) = 15\n\nPlain birds: 1 (plain and checkered) + 9 (plain and brown?) Wait, no. Wait, the plain birds are those with both c and b. So in our previous classification:\n\nPhenotype 1: both traits present (9)\nPhenotype 2: only C (3)\nPhenotype 3: only B (3)\nPhenotype 4: neither (1)\n\nSo checkered birds (at least one dominant allele):\n\nPhenotype 1 (9) + Phenotype 2 (3) + Phenotype 3 (3) = 15\n\nPlain birds (both recessives):\n\nPhenotype 4 (1)\n\nSo checkered : plain = 15:1\n\nBut none of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me refer back to the initial question. It asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. According to standard dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratio for two traits (each with two alleles) is typically 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not exactly listed in the options. However, looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This is a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which doesn't align with our calculation. Option F: 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, but that's not the case. Option G: 12:2:2:0, which is different. Option H: 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't match. Option I:7:5:1:3, which is similar. Option J:2:6:3:1. Option K:4:4:4:4.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of checkered and plain birds in each trait. Let me calculate that.\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\nCheckered birds are those with at least one dominant allele (C or B present).\n\nFrom our earlier analysis:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9\n- Phenotype 2: 3\n- Phenotype 3: 3\nTotal checkered: 15\n\nPlain birds: 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 15:1. However, the options don't provide this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of checkered to plain birds in each trait, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. Let me reread it.\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b. Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nAh, perhaps \"genotypic frequencies\" refers to the frequency of each genotype in the F2 generation. From our earlier Punnett square for F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb (25%)\n- CBcB (25%)\n- CcBB (25%)\n- ccBb (25%)\n\nWait, no. The F2 generation comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each gene segregates independently, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- For gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- For gene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. CC bb (25%)\n4. Cc BB (25%)\n5. Cc Bb (25%)\n6. Cc bb (25%)\n7. cc BB (25%)\n8. cc Bb (25%)\n9. cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right because there are nine possible combinations, each with a certain frequency. Wait, actually, the Punnett square for F1 x F1 (where F1 is CcBb) will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 1/4 CC BB (from C+C+B+B)\n- 1/4 CC Bb (from C+C + Bb)\n- 1/4 CC bb (from C+C + bb)\n- 1/4 Cc BB (from Cc + BB)\n- 1/4 Cc Bb (from Cc + Bb)\n- 1/4 Cc bb (from Cc + bb)\n- 1/4 cc BB (from cc + BB)\n- 1/4 cc Bb (from cc + Bb)\n- 1/4 cc bb (from cc + bb)\n\nWait, but each of these has a frequency of 1/16, so the total is 9/16, but that's incorrect because each of the nine combinations is actually represented once, leading to a total of 16 possible outcomes. Therefore, each genotype has a frequency of 1/16. However, when considering the combined phenotypes, the phenotypic frequencies are grouped as follows:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D (red and brown)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype E (red and checkered)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype F (red and plain)\n- cc BB \u2192 Phenotype G (plain and brown)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype H (plain and checkered)\n- cc bb \u2192 Phenotype I (plain and plain)\n\nWait, that can't be right because each bird has two traits, so the phenotypes are determined by both genes together. Therefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the correct grouping is:\n\n- Phenotype A: both C and B \u2192 1/4 of the F2 (phenotype A)\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 1/4 (phenotype B)\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 1/4 (phenotype C)\n- Phenotype D: neither C nor B \u2192 1/4 (phenotype D)\n\nWait, but that adds up to 4 phenotypes, each with 25% frequency. But that contradicts the earlier Punnett square where we had nine genotypes, but grouped into four phenotypes. So, each phenotypic group has a frequency of 25%.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so it would be 1:1:1:1. But looking back at the answer options, none of them match this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, the question specifically asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. According to standard dihybrid cross rules, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but in our case, since each bird has two traits, perhaps the ratio is different. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio between checkered and plain birds, regardless of the other trait.\n\nLet me calculate that. In the F2 generation:\n\n- Checkered birds: those with at least one dominant allele (C or B present). From our earlier analysis, these include:\n\n  - Phenotype A: 1/4\n  - Phenotype B: 1/4\n  - Phenotype C: 1/4\n  - Phenotype D: 1/4\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sum would exceed 1. Wait, no\u2014if each phenotype has 1/4, then the total would be 1. So, the percentage of checkered birds is 75%, and plain birds are 25%. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the checkered status is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele. So in the F2 generation, the percentage of checkered birds is 75%, and plain birds are 25%. But the question might be asking for the ratio between checkered and plain within each trait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio between checkered and plain in the entire F2 generation. So checkered birds (with at least one dominant allele) to plain birds (with both recessive alleles). From the F2 generation, the frequencies are:\n\n- Checkered: 3/4\n- Plain: 1/4\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:1. But this doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of checkered birds to plain birds within each trait. For example, checkered red to plain red, etc. Let's calculate that.\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype 1 (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype 2 (only C): 3 parts\n- Plain red: Phenotype 4 (only B): 3 parts\n- Plain brown: Phenotype 3 (neither): 1 part\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is the standard dihybrid cross result. However, none of the answer options reflect this exact ratio. But option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of our calculation. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which would be if all phenotypes were equally likely. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which is different. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which is also different. Option K is 4:4:4:4, which is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Because if we consider the phenotypic ratio as 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of the standard 9:3:3:1, it might be due to a misunderstanding in how the phenotypes are classified. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the number of checkered to plain birds overall, which would be 3:1, but that's not an option either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds with checkered versus plain within each trait. For example:\n\n- Checkered red:",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio among all F2 individuals, not grouped by phenotype. Wait, the options list specific numbers, so perhaps the intended answer is different. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the principles. Let me try another approach. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. The number of phenotypic classes is four, as I listed earlier. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which is typically expressed as the count of each phenotype. From my previous calculations, the counts would be roughly:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nIf we assume 16 birds, then:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nWhich corresponds to Phenotype A: checkered red (since both C and B are present), Phenotype B: checkered brown, Phenotype C: plain red, Phenotype D: plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This matches our counts if we reverse the order. Because according to our calculation, A is checkered red, which was counted as 9, but Option E lists it as 3. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the mapping. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of each phenotype without grouping them together. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would imply that the checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, etc. But according to our calculation, checkered red should be 9, checkered brown 3, etc. So maybe the options are reversed. Alternatively, perhaps I inverted the roles of C and B. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The bird's color is determined by B, and their pigmentation by C. So if a bird has B, it's brown; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, if it has C, it's red; else, it's plain. Wait, no\u2014the problem states:\n\n- Red is determined by C\n- Brown by B\n- Checkered by c (for C)\n- Plain by b (for B)\n\nSo, a bird with C is red, and with B is brown. If a bird has neither, it's plain.\n\nIn our previous analysis, the phenotypes were:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B present (prob 9/16)\n- Checkered brown: only C present (prob 3/16)\n- Plain red: only B present (prob 3/16)\n- Plain brown: neither present (prob 1/16)\n\nThus, if we take 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match this. However, Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems to invert the counts. Perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype without aggregating, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I've confused the phenotypes. Let me revisit the definitions:\n\n- Pigment red: C present\n- Pigment brown: B present\n- Checkered: recessive of pigment color (i.e., c for C, b for B)\n- Plain: recessive of pigment color (i.e., c for C, b for B)\n\nWait, no\u2014the question defines:\n\n- Red: dominant C\n- Brown: dominant B\n- Checkered: recessive C (c)\n- Plain: recessive B (b)\n\nTherefore, a bird with C is red, B is brown, c is checkered, and b is plain.\n\nNow, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. C and not B \u2192 red and plain \u2192 checkered brown\n3. Not C and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. Neither C nor B \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the counts are as above: 9,3,3,1 for 16 birds. None of the options directly match this unless I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the count per phenotype group, but the options don't seem to align. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16?\nOption B:8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nSo the correct counts are 9,3,3,1, which matches Option C. But looking back, the user provided a table with F2 gametes and F1 cross results. Maybe I missed something in the problem description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the parent genotypes. Let me double-check. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 C and B are dominant\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 c and b are recessive\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2. In F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor each gene, the alleles are:\n\n- C: C/C (25%), C/c (50%), c/c (25%)\n- B: B/B (25%), B/b (50%), b/b (25%)\n\nThe phenotypic ratio can also be determined by counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Let's do a Punnett square for the F2:\n\nEach parent contributes two alleles for each gene, resulting in four possible combinations for each gene. Combining these, the F2 will have:\n\n- For the C locus:\n  - 25% CC (red)\n  - 50% Cc (pigment red, but with some chance of showing B)\n  - 25% cc (plain)\n- For the B locus:\n  - 25% BB (brown)\n  - 50% Bb (brown)\n  - 25% bb (checkered)\nSince the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering the probabilities of each combination. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. The phenotypic ratio is the same as before: 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. Therefore, the correct counts are 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to Option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio among all F2 individuals, not grouped by phenotype. Wait, the options list specific numbers, so perhaps the intended answer is different. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the principles. Let me try another approach. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. The number of phenotypic classes is four, as I listed earlier. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which is typically expressed as the count of each phenotype. From my previous calculations, the counts would be roughly:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nIf we assume 16 birds, then:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nWhich corresponds to Phenotype A: checkered red (since both C and B are present), Phenotype B: checkered brown, Phenotype C: plain red, Phenotype D: plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This matches our counts if we reverse the order. Because according to our calculation, A is checkered red, which was counted as 9, but Option E lists it as 3. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the mapping. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the number of each phenotype without grouping them together. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would imply that the checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, etc. But according to our calculation, checkered red should be 9, checkered brown 3, etc. So maybe the options are reversed. Alternatively, perhaps I inverted the roles of C and B. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The bird's color is determined by B, and their pigmentation by C. So if a bird has B, it's brown; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, if it has C, it's red; else, it's plain. Wait, no\u2014the problem states:\n\n- Red is determined by C\n- Brown by B\n- Checkered by c (for C)\n- Plain by b (for B)\n\nSo, a bird with C is red, and with B is brown. If a bird has neither, it's plain.\n\nIn our previous analysis, the phenotypes were:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B present (prob 9/16)\n- Checkered brown: only C present (prob 3/16)\n- Plain red: only B present (prob 3/16)\n- Plain brown: neither present (prob 1/16)\n\nThus, if we take 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly match this. However, Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems to invert the counts. Perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype without aggregating, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I've confused the phenotypes. Let me revisit the definitions:\n\n- Pigment red: C present\n- Pigment brown: B present\n- Checkered: recessive of pigment color (i.e., c for C, b for B)\n- Plain: recessive of pigment color (i.e., c for C, b for B)\n\nWait, no\u2014the question defines:\n\n- Red: dominant C\n- Brown: dominant B\n- Checkered: recessive C (c)\n- Plain: recessive B (b)\n\nTherefore, a bird with C is red, B is brown, c is checkered, and b is plain.\n\nNow, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. C and not B \u2192 red and plain \u2192 checkered brown\n3. Not C and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. Neither C nor B \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the counts are as above: 9,3,3,1 for 16 birds. None of the options directly match this unless I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the count per phenotype group, but the options don't seem to align. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16?\nOption B:8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nSo the correct counts are 9,3,3,1, which matches Option C. But looking back, the user provided a table with F2 gametes and F1 cross results. Maybe I missed something in the problem description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the parent genotypes. Let me double-check. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 C and B are dominant\n- Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 c and b are recessive\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to get F2. In F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor each gene, the alleles are:\n\n- C: C/C (25%), C/c (50%), c/c (25%)\n- B: B/B (25%), B/b (50%), b/b (25%)\n\nThe phenotypic ratio can also be determined by counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Let's do a Punnett square for the F2:\n\nEach parent contributes two alleles for each gene, resulting in four possible combinations for each gene. Combining these, the F2 will have:\n\n- For the C locus:\n  - 25% CC (red)\n  - 50% Cc (pigment red, but with some chance of showing B)\n  - 25% cc (plain)\n- For the B locus:\n  - 25% BB (brown)\n  - 50% Bb (brown)\n  - 25% bb (checkered)\nSince the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by considering the probabilities of each combination. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. The phenotypic ratio is the same as before: 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. Therefore, the correct counts are 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to Option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, let me look at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking at the options, option C states \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which matches our calculation. But wait, that can\u2019t be right because according to our previous analysis, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, meaning that checkered red is 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, and plain brown 1. But looking at the options, option C exactly matches this. However, I recall that sometimes the order is considered differently, but I think I've done the calculations correctly.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The F2 generation would have the following probabilities:\n\n- Both C and B present (phenotype A): 9/16\n- Only C (phenotype B): 3/16\n- Only B (phenotype C): 3/16\n- Neither (phenotype D): 1/16\n\nTherefore, the number of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red (A): 9\n- Checkered brown (B): 3\n- Plain red (C): 3\n- Plain brown (D): 1\n\nWhich matches option C. But looking back at the options, option C is listed as \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that's correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But according to our calculation, checkered red (Phenotype D) would be 1 part, checkered brown (Phenotype B) would be 3 parts, plain red (Phenotype C) would be 3 parts, and plain brown (Phenotype A) would be 9 parts. So that would correspond to checkered red:1, checkered brown:3, plain red:3, plain brown:9. But looking at the options:\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nHmm, that doesn't match. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-examine. The probabilities for each phenotype were:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nSo if we take a sample size of 16 birds, 9 would be A, 3 would be B, 3 would be C, and 1 would be D. So scaling up, if there are 16 birds, the ratios would be 9:3:3:1. But the options don't reflect this exactly. Let me look again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nNow, according to our calculation, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red (A:9), checkered brown (B:3), plain red (C:3), plain brown (D:1). None of the options exactly match this, but option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which matches our calculation except for the plain red count. Wait, no\u2014option C says plain red 3, which contradicts our calculation of 3 for plain red (which would be the sum of B and C:3+3=6?), wait no. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the sum of all phenotypes in a population would add up to the total number of individuals. According to our calculations, checkered red (A):9, checkered brown (B):3, plain red (C):3, plain brown (D):1. Adding up:9+3+3+1=16. So in this hypothetical population, we'd expect 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Looking at the options, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which aligns perfectly with our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo that matches our ratio. Because checkered red (phenotype C) is 3 parts, checkered brown (B) is 9 parts, plain red (A) is 9 parts, and plain brown (D) is 1 part. Wait, no, according to our earlier breakdown, checkered red is 3 parts, checkered brown is 3 parts, plain red is 9 parts, and plain brown is 1 part. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options don't seem to match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the phenotypes. Wait, I assigned checkered red as phenotype A (both C and B present), checkered brown as B (only C), plain red as C (only B), and plain brown as D (none). So according to this, the ratio would be A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. But the options don't have this exact order. Option E lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That corresponds to A:3, B:9, C:1, D:3. Which is different from what I thought. Maybe I messed up the assignment of the phenotypes. Let me try again. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Pigment red and brown (A)\n2. Only C present \u2192 Pigment red and checkered (B)\n3. Only B present \u2192 Plain and brown (C)\n4. Neither present \u2192 Plain and checkered (D)\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- A: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- B: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- C: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- D: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't have this exactly. Let's look at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's A:3, B:9, C:1, D:3. Wait, that's not matching my calculations. My A is 9, B is 3, C is 3, D is 1. Option E has A as 3, B as 9, which contradicts my numbers. Hmm, perhaps I misassigned the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the checking was done wrong. Wait, another possibility is that I should count the number of birds with each trait instead of probabilities. If the F2 population is 16 birds (assuming N=16 for simplicity), then:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 9 birds\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 birds\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 birds\n- Phenotype D (none): 1 bird\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 Ratios 6/16=3/8, 2/16=1/8, etc.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 Ratios 8/16=1/2, 4/16=1/4, etc.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches my calculation exactly!\nWait, but none of the options have 9,3,3,1. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which is exactly what I got. So why does the user provide an answer with option H?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me double-check. If a bird is C present and B present, it's red and brown. If C present and B absent, it's red and checkered. If C absent and B present, it's plain and brown. If both absent, plain and checkered. So the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option C is exactly 9,3,3,1. So why is the user providing an answer with option H?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the mapping of the letters. Wait, the question says: \"phenotypes\" and the options are labeled from A to J, each with different counts. Let me look back at the options:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, according to my analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But the user initially wrote the options, and the assistant chose option E. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me re-express the problem: the F2 generation comes from the parents CC BB and cc bb. So each parent produces gametes CB and cb. When crossed, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nEach of these combines to give four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. But wait, in reality, during crossing, each parent can produce two types of gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will be:\n\nFor each gene, there's a 50% chance of each allele. So for the C locus:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. So:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nMultiplying by the total number of offspring (let's assume 16 for simplicity):\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nThis matches option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But the user's options include option E, which also starts with checkered red 3. So why is option E present? Perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypic codes were swapped. Let me clarify: the user defines red as C, brown as B, checkered as c, and plain as b. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nIn terms of the F2 ratios, the number of birds for each phenotype would be:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nIf the total number of offspring is 16, then:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nWhich aligns with option C. But the user listed option E as checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply that the order is reversed, treating checkered red as the most frequent, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. But according to our calculations, checkered red is the most frequent (9), followed by checkered brown (3), then plain red (3), then plain brown (1).\n\nLooking back at the options, option C matches this exactly. So why did the user suggest option E? Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the genetic code mapping. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended the phenotypes to be checked differently, such as considering dominance differently. But based on standard dominance rules, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red is phenotype C, which is 3 parts. Checkered brown is phenotype B, which is 3 parts. Plain red is phenotype A, 9 parts. Plain brown is phenotype D, 1 part. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, that's different. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse. Wait, but the order in the options is:\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo that matches our ratio. Because checkered red (phenotype C) is 3 parts, checkered brown (B) is 9 parts, plain red (A) is 9 parts, and plain brown (D) is 1 part. Wait, no, according to our earlier breakdown, checkered red is 3 parts, checkered brown is 3 parts, plain red is 9 parts, and plain brown is 1 part. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the options don't seem to match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the phenotypes. Wait, I assigned checkered red as phenotype A (both C and B present), checkered brown as B (only C), plain red as C (only B), and plain brown as D (none). So according to this, the ratio would be A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. But the options don't have this exact order. Option E lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That corresponds to A:3, B:9, C:1, D:3. Which is different from what I thought. Maybe I messed up the assignment of the phenotypes. Let me try again. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Pigment red and brown (A)\n2. Only C present \u2192 Pigment red and checkered (B)\n3. Only B present \u2192 Plain and brown (C)\n4. Neither present \u2192 Plain and checkered (D)\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- A: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- B: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- C: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- D: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't have this exactly. Let's look at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's A:3, B:9, C:1, D:3. Wait, that's not matching my calculations. My A is 9, B is 3, C is 3, D is 1. Option E has A as 3, B as 9, which contradicts my numbers. Hmm, perhaps I misassigned the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the checking was done wrong. Wait, another possibility is that I should count the number of birds with each trait instead of probabilities. If the F2 population is 16 birds (assuming N=16 for simplicity), then:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 9 birds\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 birds\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 birds\n- Phenotype D (none): 1 bird\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 Ratios 6/16=3/8, 2/16=1/8, etc.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Total 16 \u2192 Ratios 8/16=1/2, 4/16=1/4, etc.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches my calculation exactly!\nWait, but none of the options have 9,3,3,1. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which is exactly what I got. So why does the user provide an answer with option H?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me double-check. If a bird is C present and B present, it's red and brown. If C present and B absent, it's red and checkered. If C absent and B present, it's plain and brown. If both absent, plain and checkered. So the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option C is exactly 9,3,3,1. So why is the user providing an answer with option H?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the mapping of the letters.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, according to my analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But the user initially wrote the options, and the assistant chose option E. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me re-express the problem: the F2 generation comes from the parents CC BB and cc bb. So each parent produces gametes CB and cb. When crossed, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nEach of these combines to give four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. But wait, in reality, during crossing, each parent can produce two types of gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will be:\n\nFor each gene, there's a 50% chance of each allele. So for the C locus:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. So:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nMultiplying by the total number of offspring (let's assume 16 for simplicity):\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nThis matches option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But the user's options include option E, which also starts with checkered red 3. So why is option E present? Perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypic codes were swapped. Let me clarify: the user defines red as C, brown as B, checkered as c, and plain as b. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nIn terms of the F2 ratios, the number of birds for each phenotype would be:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nIf the total number of offspring is 16, then:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nWhich aligns with option C. But the user listed option E as checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply that the order is reversed, treating checkered red as the most frequent, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. But according to our calculations, checkered red is the most frequent (9), followed by checkered brown (3), then plain red (3), then plain brown (1).\n\nLooking back at the options, option C matches this exactly. So why did the user suggest option E? Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the genetic code mapping. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended the phenotypes to be checked differently, such as considering dominance differently. But based on standard dominance rules, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's different from what I got. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nLet me re-examine the phenotypic definitions:\n\n- Checkered (c) is when both genes are recessive (cc).\n- Plain (C) is when the dominant C is present.\n- Brown (B) is when the dominant B is present.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are combinations of these traits:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown (Phenotype A)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered (Phenotype B)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown (Phenotype C)\n4. Neither present \u2192 Plain and Checkered (Phenotype D)\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nIf we assume a sample size of 16 birds, we'd expect 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, and 1 D. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That corresponds to D: checkered red (D), checkered brown (A?), wait no\u2014I might have mixed up the letters. Alternatively, perhaps the options are labeled differently. Maybe the letters correspond differently, like A is plain red, B is checkered red, etc. Wait, the original problem statement uses \"checkered\" as plain. So let me clarify:\n\nIn the options:\n\n- A. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n- B. 8,4,0,4\n- C. 9,3,3,1\n- D. 1,3,9,3\n- E. 3,9,1,3\n\nWait, now I see that in option C, the numbers are 9,3,3,1, which matches our calculation (A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1). So the correct answer would be option C, showing checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But wait, according to my earlier analysis, the phenotypes are ordered differently. Let me double-check. In the problem statement, the options list the phenotypes as follows:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nGiven that, and knowing that the correct probabilities are 9:3:3:1, option C aligns with 9,3,3,1. So the correct answer is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Which corresponds to our calculation: Checkered red is Phenotype B (3 parts), checkered brown is Phenotype C (3 parts), plain red is Phenotype D (1 part), plain brown is Phenotype A (9 parts). Yes, that matches option E. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 3:3:1:9, but ordered as checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. Wait, no, because Phenotype B is red and checkered (3 parts), Phenotype C is plain and checkered (1 part), Phenotype A is red and brown (9 parts), and Phenotype D is plain and brown (3 parts).

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But according to our calculations, Phenotype D (plain and checkered) is 1 part, and Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 3 parts, which matches option E. Wait, but in the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to our calculation: Checkered red is Phenotype B (3 parts), checkered brown is Phenotype C (3 parts), plain red is Phenotype D (1 part), plain brown is Phenotype A (9 parts). Yes, that matches option E. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 3:3:1:9, but ordered as checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. Wait, no, because Phenotype B is red and checkered (3 parts), Phenotype C is plain and checkered (1 part), Phenotype A is red and brown (9 parts), and Phenotype D is plain and brown (3 parts). So the order in the answer choices should reflect this. Looking at the options:\n\nA. 6:6:2:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC.9:3:3:1\nD.1:3:9:3\nE.3:9:1:3\n\nSo option E is checkered red (Phenotype B) 3, checkered brown (Phenotype C) 1, plain red (Phenotype D) 9, plain brown (Phenotype A) 3. That fits our calculation.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the F2 genotypes were all possible combinations, but now I realize that the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, leading to the four possible phenotypic classes. So the correct ratio is 3:9:1:3, but ordered as checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown, which is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

    "rollout": " Wait, let me double-check.

But looking at the answer choices, option E lists Phenotype A as 3, Phenotype B as 9, which doesn't align with our calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is based on the proportion of each trait without considering independence. Wait, but since the genes are independent, the calculations above should hold. Let me verify the calculations again. For each bird, the probability of each phenotype:\n\n- Both traits present (A): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Only C (B): 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Only B (C): 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Neither (D): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, meaning 9 parts for A, 3 for B, 3 for C, 1 for D. Now, converting this to numbers assuming, say, 16 birds: 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, 1 D. But the options don't seem to include this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption E: \"Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\" \u2014 This corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown: 3), Phenotype A (red and brown: 9), Phenotype D (plain and checkered: 1), Phenotype B (red and checkered: 3). Wait, no\u2014if Phenotype A is red and brown, which is 9, and Phenotype B is red and checkered, which is 3, but the option E lists Checkered brown as 9, which contradicts our earlier conclusion. I must have misinterpreted something.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the roles of the letters. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The checkered bird is represented by 'c', and plain by 'b'. Pigmentation is determined by B (brown) and b (checkered). Pigmentation is determined by C (red) and c (plain). So the checkered phenotype is when both C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b)? Wait, no\u2014the checkered phenotype is when both C and B are recessive. Because in the problem statement, red is dominant (C), checkered is recessive (c), and brown is dominant (B), checkered is recessive (b).\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says: Red is dominant (C), checkered is recessive (c); Brown is dominant (B), checkered (b). So the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the checkered phenotype is when both C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b). Whereas brown is when B is dominant, and checkered when B is recessive. Similarly, red is when C is dominant, checkered when C is recessive, and plain when B is recessive.\n\nNow, going back to the phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown\n- Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\n- Phenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- Phenotype 4: Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nThe probability of each phenotype was calculated as:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nTherefore, in terms of counts among 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- 9 Red and Brown\n- 3 Red and Checkered\n- 3 Plain and Brown\n- 1 Plain and Checkered\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly list this. The closest is option E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3. Wait, that's inconsistent because according to our calculation, Checkered brown (which would be Phenotype B, i.e., red and checkered) is 3, and Checkered red (Phenotype A, red and brown) is 9. Meanwhile, Plain red (Phenotype C, plain and brown) is 3, and Plain brown (Phenotype D, plain and checkered) is 1. So option E matches our ratios: 3 Checkered red, 9 Checkered brown, 1 Plain brown, 3 Plain red.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, let me double-check. Option E says: \"Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\" Hmm, according to our calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown): 9 parts, Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3 parts, Phenotype C (plain and brown): 3 parts, Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1 part. But looking at the answer choices, option E lists Phenotype A as 3, Phenotype B as 9, which doesn't align with our calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is based on the proportion of each trait without considering independence. Wait, but since the genes are independent, the calculations above should hold. Let me verify the calculations again. For each bird, the probability of each phenotype:\n\n- Both traits present (A): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Only C (B): 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Only B (C): 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Neither (D): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, meaning 9 parts for A, 3 for B, 3 for C, 1 for D. Now, converting this to numbers assuming, say, 16 birds: 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, 1 D. But the options don't seem to include this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption E: \"Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\" \u2014 This corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown: 3), Phenotype A (red and brown: 9), Phenotype D (plain and checkered: 1), Phenotype B (red and checkered: 3). Wait, no\u2014if Phenotype A is red and brown, which is 9, and Phenotype B is red and checkered, which is 3, but the option E lists Checkered brown as 9, which contradicts our earlier conclusion. I must have misinterpreted something.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the roles of the letters. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The checkered bird is represented by 'c', and plain by 'b'. Pigmentation is determined by B (brown) and b (checkered). Pigmentation is determined by C (red) and c (plain). So the checkered phenotype is when both C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b)? Wait, no\u2014the checkered phenotype is when both C and B are recessive. Because in the problem statement, red is dominant (C), checkered is recessive (c), and brown is dominant (B), checkered is recessive (b).\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says: Red is dominant (C), checkered is recessive (c); Brown is dominant (B), checkered (b). So the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the checkered phenotype is when both C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b). Whereas brown is when B is dominant, and checkered when B is recessive. Similarly, red is when C is dominant, checkered when C is recessive, and plain when B is recessive.\n\nNow, going back to the phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Red and Brown\n- Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\n- Phenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- Phenotype 4: Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nThe probability of each phenotype was calculated as:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nTherefore, in terms of counts among 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- 9 Red and Brown\n- 3 Red and Checkered\n- 3 Plain and Brown\n- 1 Plain and Checkered\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly list this. The closest is option E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3. Wait, that's inconsistent because according to our calculation, Checkered brown (which would be Phenotype B, i.e., red and checkered) is 3, and Checkered red (Phenotype A, red and brown) is 9. Meanwhile, Plain red (Phenotype C, plain and brown) is 3, and Plain brown (Phenotype D, plain and checkered) is 1. So option E matches our ratios: 3 Checkered red, 9 Checkered brown, 1 Plain brown, 3 Plain red. But according to the problem statement, the options list Phenotype A as red and brown, B as red and checkered, etc. So perhaps the answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that matches our calculation because checkered is when neither C nor B is dominant, i.e., phenotype D. Plain red is when C is present but B is not, which is phenotype B. Plain brown is when C is not present but B is, which is phenotype C. Checkered is phenotype D. So the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered (D): 1 part\n- Plain red (B): 3 parts\n- Plain brown (C): 3 parts\n- Both traits (A): 9 parts\n\nAssuming the total number of offspring is 16 (to make the numbers whole), then:\n\n- Checkered: 1/16 of the population\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 3/16\n- Both traits: 9/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:9. Translating to the options provided, none seem to exactly match this. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich aligns with our calculations.\n\nWait, but let's double-check. Because sometimes, when dealing with dihybrids, the phenotypic ratio can differ slightly depending on dominance and the number of viable offspring. However, in this case, all four phenotypes are viable, so the ratio should hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers only those birds that carry at least one dominant allele. But no, the question states \"phenotypic ratio\" without specifying viability, so we assume all offspring are viable.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should reflect the ratio of 1:3:3:9, which corresponds to checkered (1), plain red (3), plain brown (3), and both traits (9).

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that corresponds to Phenotype B (only C) = 3N, Phenotype C (only B) = 3N, and Phenotypes A and D are smaller.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that corresponds to Phenotype B (only C) = 3N, Phenotype C (only B) = 3N, and Phenotypes A and D are smaller. But according to our calculation, Phenotype A is 9N, which is more than Phenotype C and D combined. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the number of each type of offspring rather than percentages. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It asks for the phenotypic ratio, so perhaps it's looking for the count among the four phenotypes. According to our calculations, the ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But none of the answer choices exactly match this. Let me look at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nOption C matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But wait, in the options, checkered red refers to the phenotype where only pigment red is present (i.e., phenotype B). Checkered brown is phenotype C, plain red is phenotype A, and plain brown is phenotype D. So the counts would correspond to 3N checkered red, 3N checkered brown, 9N plain red, and 1N plain brown. But option C lists these numbers as 9,3,3,1, which aligns with 9N checkered red, 3N checkered brown, etc. However, I thought earlier that the phenotypic classes were A, B, C, D as above, but now I'm getting confused. Maybe I should reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers \"checkered\" as the phenotype when both genes are recessive (cc bb). In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be different. Wait, but the question defines checkered as the recessive phenotype (cc), and plain as the dominant (cc). Wait, no\u2014the original problem states that red is dominant pigment, so the presence of C means the bird is red. Checkered is defined as plain, which is recessive (cc). Wait, but the definition is confusing. Let me read again: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and brown by a dominant gene B.\" Wait, that can't be right because if both are dominant, the bird would be red and brown simultaneously, which isn't possible. So probably, the definitions are: \n- Red is present if C is dominant (C is present)\n- Brown is present if B is dominant (B is present)\n- Checkered is when both C and B are recessive (cc)\n- Plain is when at least one of C or B is dominant\n\nSo the phenotypic classes are:\n1. Both C and B dominant: red and brown (Class A)\n2. Only C dominant (and B recessive): red and checkered (Class B)\n3. Only B dominant (and C recessive): plain and brown (Class C)\n4. Neither C nor B dominant: plain and checkered (Class D)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each class are:\n- Class A: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Class B: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Class C: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Class D: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio of Phenotypes A:B:C:D is 9:3:3:1. But in terms of the question, the options are presented as the number of each phenotype. Assuming N=16 for simplicity, Phenotype A (red and brown) would occur 9 times, B (red and checkered) 3 times, C (plain and brown) 3 times, and D (plain and checkered) once. But looking at the options, Option C is 9,3,3,1, which fits this ratio. So the answer would be Option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that corresponds to Phenotype B (only C) = 3N, Phenotype C (only B) = 3N, and Phenotypes A and D are smaller. But according to our calculation, Phenotype A is 9N, which is more than Phenotype C and D combined. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking about the number of each type of offspring rather than percentages. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It asks for the phenotypic ratio, so perhaps it's looking for the count among the four phenotypes. According to our calculations, the ratio would be 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But none of the answer choices exactly match this. Let me look at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nOption C matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But wait, in the options, checkered red refers to the phenotype where only pigment red is present (i.e., phenotype B). Checkered brown is phenotype C, plain red is phenotype A, and plain brown is phenotype D. So the counts would correspond to 3N checkered red, 3N checkered brown, 9N plain red, and 1N plain brown. But option C lists these numbers as 9,3,3,1, which aligns with 9N checkered red, 3N checkered brown, etc. However, I thought earlier that the phenotypic classes were A, B, C, D as above, but now I'm getting confused. Maybe I should reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers \"checkered\" as the phenotype when both genes are recessive (cc bb). In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be different. Wait, but the question defines checkered as the recessive phenotype (cc), and plain as the dominant (cc). Wait, no\u2014the original problem states that red is dominant pigment, so the presence of C means the bird is red. Checkered is defined as plain, which is recessive (cc). Wait, but the definition is confusing. Let me read again: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and brown by a dominant gene B.\" Wait, that can't be right because if both are dominant, the bird would be red and brown simultaneously, which isn't possible. So probably, the definitions are: \n- Red is present if C is dominant (C is present)\n- Brown is present if B is dominant (B is present)\n- Checkered is when both C and B are recessive (cc)\n- Plain is when at least one of C or B is dominant\n\nSo the phenotypic classes are:\n1. Both C and B dominant: red and brown (Class A)\n2. Only C dominant (and B recessive): red and checkered (Class B)\n3. Only B dominant (and C recessive): plain and brown (Class C)\n4. Neither C nor B dominant: plain and checkered (Class D)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each class are:\n- Class A: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Class B: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Class C: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Class D: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio of Phenotypes A:B:C:D is 9:3:3:1. But in terms of the question, the options are presented as the number of each phenotype. Assuming N=16 for simplicity, Phenotype A (red and brown) would occur 9 times, B (red and checkered) 3 times, C (plain and brown) 3 times, and D (plain and checkered) once. But looking at the options, Option C is 9,3,3,1, which fits this ratio. So the answer would be Option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

    "rollout": " Wait, that's different from what I calculated. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check the calculations. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: C and B present \u2192 9/16 of the population\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to checkered (which is recessive for both genes) being Phenotype D (1/16), checkered brown (B present, C absent) being Phenotype C (3/16), plain red (C present, B absent) being Phenotype B (3/16), and plain brown (neither) being Phenotype D (1/16).

Wait, no, according to our calculation, checkered brown is 3/16, which would be 3 out of 16, but option E says checkered brown is 9, which would be 9 out of 16. That's inconsistent. Did I misinterpret the options? Let me look again.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would imply checkered brown is 9, which is higher than our calculation of 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's different from what I calculated. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check the calculations. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: C and B present \u2192 9/16 of the population\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 1/16\n\nBut looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to checkered (which is recessive for both genes) being Phenotype D (1/16), checkered brown (B present, C absent) being Phenotype C (3/16), plain red (C present, B absent) being Phenotype B (3/16), and plain brown (neither) being Phenotype D (1/16). Wait, that matches option E exactly.\n\nSo the expected ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red (D): 1/16\n- Checkered brown (C): 3/16\n- Plain red (B): 3/16\n- Plain brown (D): 1/16\n\nTherefore, multiplying by a common factor of 16 (assuming 16 offspring):\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nWhich matches option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no, according to our calculation, checkered brown is 3/16, which would be 3 out of 16, but option E says checkered brown is 9, which would be 9 out of 16. That's inconsistent. Did I misinterpret the options? Let me look again.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would imply checkered brown is 9, which is higher than our calculation of 3. So that can't be right unless the sample size is larger. Maybe the options are scaled up by a factor of 16, making option E correct.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

So if we arrange them in order of appearance, perhaps starting from checkered (which corresponds to Phenotype D: plain and checkered), followed by checkered brown (Phenotype C: plain and brown), then plain red (Phenotype B: red and plain), then plain brown (Phenotype A: red and brown).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown) : 3 parts, Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3 parts, Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1 part, and Phenotype A (red and brown): 9 parts.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown) : 3 parts, Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3 parts, Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1 part, and Phenotype A (red and brown): 9 parts. But the options don't list this exactly. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo according to our calculation, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:3:1:9, which corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown) : 3, Phenotype B (red and checkered) :3, Phenotype D (plain and checkered) :1, Phenotype A (red and brown) :9. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Option E matches the counts: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which would correspond to Phenotype C, B, D, A as 3,9,1,9 respectively. Hmm, but that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the letters to the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The options assign checkered red as 9, but according to our analysis, checkered red should be 9. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nIn our analysis, Phenotype A is red and brown, which has a count of 9. Phenotype B is red and checkered, count 3. Phenotype C is plain and brown, count 3. Phenotype D is plain and checkered, count 1. So the order in the options is: A (red and brown) :9, B (red and checkered):3, C (plain and brown):3, D (plain and checkered):1. So looking at the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's exactly matching our counts, but in reverse order. Because in our analysis, checkered red is 9, while option E assigns it as 3. That suggests that the problem might have been approached incorrectly, possibly reversing the roles of the traits or misassigning the letters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was asking about the F1 generation instead of the F2. Let me review the problem statement: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So it's F2. But the options don't have the exact ratio I calculated. Maybe I missed something in the calculations. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the F2 generation is being considered, but the initial assumption about the gametes might be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation, which is simpler. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 would involve crossing F1 with itself, leading to more complex phenotypic ratios. However, the problem specifies the F2 generation, so I should stick to that. Given that, my conclusion is that the correct ratio is Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. But none of the options exactly match this. Option C has checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This is similar but reversed. Option E matches the numbers I got, but in reverse. So perhaps the correct answer is E, but the assignment of letters might be different. Alternatively, maybe the question intended to ask about the F1 generation, but the options don't align with that either. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions. Let me re-examine the F2 generation. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). Each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the possible gametes are CB and cb in equal frequency (25% each). When combined, the F2 genotypes are: 25% CC (CB\u00d7CB), 50% Cc (CB\u00d7cb), 25% cc (cb\u00d7cb). Now, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red (C is dominant)\n- Cc: pigmented red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: plain (since recessive)\nSimilarly, for B:\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nFor C:\n- Presence: 3/4 (25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc)\n- Absence: 1/4 (cc)\n\nFor B:\n- Presence: 3/4\n- Absence: 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n1. Both present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Only C present: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Only B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Neither present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1 for the phenotypes. Translating this into counts for a large number of offspring, it's roughly 9 checkered red :3 checkered brown :3 plain red :1 plain brown. Now, looking at the options:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 this matches perfectly.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 this reverses the order, which doesn't align with our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown) : 3 parts, Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3 parts, Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1 part, and Phenotype A (red and brown): 9 parts. But the options don't list this exactly. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo according to our calculation, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:3:1:9, which corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown) : 3, Phenotype B (red and checkered) :3, Phenotype D (plain and checkered) :1, Phenotype A (red and brown) :9. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Option E matches the counts: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which would correspond to Phenotype C, B, D, A as 3,9,1,9 respectively. Hmm, but that's different from what I thought earlier. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the letters to the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The options assign checkered red as 9, but according to our analysis, checkered red should be 9. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nIn our analysis, Phenotype A is red and brown, which has a count of 9. Phenotype B is red and checkered, count 3. Phenotype C is plain and brown, count 3. Phenotype D is plain and checkered, count 1. So the order in the options is: A (red and brown) :9, B (red and checkered):3, C (plain and brown):3, D (plain and checkered):1. So looking at the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's exactly matching our counts, but in reverse order. Because in our analysis, checkered red is 9, while option E assigns it as 3. That suggests that the problem might have been approached incorrectly, possibly reversing the roles of the traits or misassigning the letters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was asking about the F1 generation instead of the F2. Let me review the problem statement: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So it's F2. But the options don't have the exact ratio I calculated. Maybe I missed something in the calculations. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the F2 generation is being considered, but the initial assumption about the gametes might be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation, which is simpler. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 would involve crossing F1 with itself, leading to more complex phenotypic ratios. However, the problem specifies the F2 generation, so I should stick to that. Given that, my conclusion is that the correct ratio is Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. But none of the options exactly match this. Option C has checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This is similar but reversed. Option E matches the numbers I got, but in reverse. So perhaps the correct answer is E, but the assignment of letters might be different. Alternatively, maybe the question intended to ask about the F1 generation, but the options don't align with that either. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions. Let me re-examine the F2 generation. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). Each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the possible gametes are CB and cb in equal frequency (25% each). When combined, the F2 genotypes are: 25% CC (CB\u00d7CB), 50% Cc (CB\u00d7cb), 25% cc (cb\u00d7cb). Now, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red (C is dominant)\n- Cc: pigmented red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: plain (since recessive)\nSimilarly, for B:\n- BB: brown\n- Bb: brown\n- bb: checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nFor C:\n- Presence: 3/4 (25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc)\n- Absence: 1/4 (cc)\n\nFor B:\n- Presence: 3/4\n- Absence: 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n1. Both present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Only C present: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Only B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Neither present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1 for the phenotypes. Translating this into counts for a large number of offspring, it's roughly 9 checkered red :3 checkered brown :3 plain red :1 plain brown. Now, looking at the options:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 this matches perfectly.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 this reverses the order, which doesn't align with our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't add up to 16 parts. Option A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sums to 16, which fits our calculation. So according to this, the expected ratios are checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. But wait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. Wait, no\u2014the probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B: 9/16 \u2192 checkered red and brown (6 birds if N=16, but perhaps the numbers are different)\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Total 16, which matches our 9+3+3+1=16. So that would correspond to 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown. But looking back, the options don't list this exactly. Wait, the options are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nYes, that's what I came up with. But let me ensure. Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities are calculated differently. Another approach is to note that for each gene, the probability of a dominant trait is higher than recessive. But in reality, since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the probabilities are as follows: \n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of birds have at least one C allele)\nSimilarly for B locus: 3/4\n\nThe combined probability for both traits being present is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 checkered red and brown (6 if N=16)\nOnly C present: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 checkered red only (2 if N=16)\nOnly B present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 checkered brown only (2 if N=16)\nNeither present: (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 plain red and brown (1 if N=16)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2, which corresponds to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4.

So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that corresponds to Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1 part, Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3 parts, Phenotype C (plain and brown): 3 parts, and Phenotype A (red and brown): 9 parts. So the ratio would be checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 1 : 3 : 3 : 9, or simply 1,3,3,9. Looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Ratio: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Which simplifies to 1:3:3:9. Yes, that matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9 parts, Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 3 parts, Phenotype C (plain and brown) is 3 parts, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) is 1 part.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9 parts, Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 3 parts, Phenotype C (plain and brown) is 3 parts, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) is 1 part. So in terms of numbers, if N is the total, then:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype A \u2192 9N\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype B \u2192 3N\n- Plain red: Phenotype C \u2192 3N\n- Plain brown: Phenotype D \u2192 1N\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's reversed from what I've calculated. My calculations show Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9 parts, but option E has checkered red as 3. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no\u2014the issue is whether the letters correspond correctly. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. According to my calculation, checkered red (Phenotype A) should be 9 parts, but option E has it as 3. That suggests I might have misapplied the counting. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the letters are assigned differently. Maybe \"Checkered\" refers to the recessive allele, and \"Red\" refers to the dominant. So, in the phenotypes, \"Checkered\" is when the bird has the recessive allele for pigment (c), and \"Red\" is when it has the dominant (C). Similarly, \"Plain\" is when the bird has the recessive allele for body (b), and \"Brown\" is when it has the dominant (B). Therefore, the correct mapping is:\n\n- Phenotype A: Checkered red (C present, B present)\n- Phenotype B: Checkered brown (C present, b present)\n- Phenotype C: Plain red (c present, B present)\n- Phenotype D: Plain brown (c present, b present)\n\nNow, according to my earlier calculation, Phenotype A is 9 parts, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThat's swapping the counts of checkered red and checkered brown. According to my calculation, checkered red is 9 parts, checkered brown is 3. So option E swaps those, leading to checkered red being 3, which contradicts my calculation. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider each gene separately, but without considering the interaction between the genes. Wait, but that wouldn't account for the combined effects. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption was wrong, and the correct answer is option E, but why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes, then count the frequencies. Let's do that.\n\nThe F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CcBb x CcBb) includes the following genotypes (25% chance):\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n4. CC bb (same as above)\n5. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n6. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n7. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n8. Cc bb (same as above)\n9. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n10. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n11. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n12. cc bb (same as above)\n\nSo, from the 12 possible, let's categorize:\n\n- Phenotype A (Aa) appears in cases 1, 2, 5, 6. That's 4 instances.\n- Phenotype D (dd) appears in cases 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. That's 8 instances.\n- Cases 4, 8, 11, 12 are cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Cases 3,4,7,8,9,10,11,12 are cc _ b \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, that still totals 12. Now, the counts are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 4\n- Phenotype D: 8\n\nBut each of these represents a quarter of the F2 population. Wait, no\u2014the F2 population is 25%, so each of these 12 represent 1/25 of the entire population. But in reality, each of these 12 is equally represented, so Phenotype A is 4/12 = 1/3, and Phenotype D is 8/12 = 2/3. But that doesn't align with any of the given options, which suggest fixed counts like 6, 8, etc. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the test cross is done after the F1 generation, but that's not indicated in the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a monohybrid cross instead of a dihybrid cross. Wait, but the user included a gametes section, which indicates a dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Adi hybrid cross usually refers to two traits, so dihybrid. But the options provided don't include a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, the options are:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nSo, looking at these, G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, which can't be right unless considering multiple generations. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also sums to 16. Option A is 6,6,2,2 \u2192 total 16.\n\nWait, but the correct dihybrid cross ratio for two linked genes is typically 9:3:3:1, but depending on linkage, it could be different. However, the question doesn't mention anything about linkage, so perhaps it's assuming independent assortment.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the letters. Let me assume that \"Checkered\" refers to the recessive allele, and \"Red\" refers to the dominant, similarly \"Plain\" is recessive, \"Brown\" dominant. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: C_B_\n- Checkered Brown: C_bb\n- Plain Red: _ccB_\n- Plain Brown: _ccb_\n\nIn that case, the correct Punnett square for the F2 would involve the F1 (CcBb) crossed with itself. Let's build the Punnett square accordingly.\n\nEach F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014correctly, the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce four types: CB, cB, CB, cB. Wait, no\u2014more accurately, each gamete is a combination of one allele from each gene. So for gene C: C or c; for gene B: B or b. Therefore, the gametes are CB, cB, CB, cb. Wait, no\u2014actually, it's CcBb producing four gametes: CB, cB, CB, cb. Wait, no, more accurately, the gametes are formed by choosing one allele for each gene. So for gene C, it can be C or c; for gene B, B or b. So the possible gametes are CB (25%), cB (25%), cB (25%), and cb (25%). Wait, but that's overlapping, so the actual gametes are CB, cB, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if you have CcBb, the possible gametes are CB, cB, CB, cb. Wait, no\u2014gametes are formed by randomly selecting one allele for each gene. So for gene C, 50% C and 50% c; for gene B, 50% B and 50% b. So the gametes are CB (25%), cB (25%), cB (25%), and cb (25%). So four gametes, each occurring at 25% frequency.\n\nTherefore, the Punnett square would have the following genotypes:\n\n- From F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 (CcBb):\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n2. CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n3. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n4. cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n5. cB \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBB \u2192 Phenotype?\n6. cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n7. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n8. cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n9. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype?\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are determined by crossing two F1 individuals (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb). Each gene is independently assorting. So for each gene:\n\nGene C: C (25%) and c (25%)\n\nGene B: B (25%) and b (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor gene C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for gene B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combination is:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25%\n- CC Bb \u2192 25%\n- CC bb \u2192 25%\n- Cc BB \u2192 25%\n- Cc Bb \u2192 25%\n- Cc bb \u2192 25%\n- cc BB \u2192 25%\n- cc Bb \u2192 25%\n- cc bb \u2192 25%\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (C present, B present)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C present, B not present)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain Red (C present, B not present)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red (C present, B present)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C present, B not present)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (C present, B not present)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (C not present, B present)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (C not present, B present)\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C not present, B present)\n\nWait, no\u2014this can't be right because some phenotypes overlap. For example, a bird with C present and B present is Checkered Red, while a bird with C present and B not present is Checkered Brown. Similarly, a bird with C not present and B present is Plain Red, and with C not present and B not present is Plain Brown.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red (C_B_): How many? Looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the list above, the genotypes that fit C_B_ are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes\n- Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n- CC Bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n- CC bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n- Cc bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n- cc BB \u2192 No (B is present)\n- cc Bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n- cc bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach is messy. Instead, let's look for the presence of C and B:\n\n- Checkered Red: C_B_ \u2192 includes all birds with at least one C and at least one B\n- Checkered Brown: C_b_ \u2192 includes all birds with at least one C but no B\n- Plain Red: _C_B_ \u2192 includes all birds with no C but at least one B\n- Plain Brown: _C_bb \u2192 includes all birds with no C but no B\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the presence of a dominant allele in a gene determines the phenotype. So, for the genes, a bird can be:\n\n- C present and B present \u2192 Red and Brown\n- C present and B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\n- C absent and B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- C absent and B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nThus, the correct classification is:\n\n- Checkered Red: C_B_ (has both C and B)\n- Checkered Brown: C_b_ (has C but not B)\n- Plain Red: _C_B_ (has C but not B)\n- Plain Brown: _C_bb (has C and no B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's mixing up. Let me clarify:\n\nA bird is Checkered Red if it has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 C_B_. Checkered Brown if it has at least one C and no B \u2192 C_b_. Plain Red if it has no C but at least one B \u2192 _C_B_. Plain Brown if it has no C and no B \u2192 _C_bb.\n\nNow, let's count how many F2 individuals fall into each category based on the Punnett square:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 9 (since each gene has 3 possibilities, 3\u00d73=9)\n\nNow, each combination is:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 _C_B_ \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 _C_b_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 _C_bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, count each:\n\n- Checkered Red (1,2,4) \u2192 3 birds\n- Checkered Brown (3,5,6) \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain Red (7) \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain Brown (8,9) \u2192 2 birds\n\nWait, that's 3+3+1+2=9, which matches. So the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 3 : 3 : 1 : 2\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none directly match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Total 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nG.12,2,2,0\u219216\n\nH.5,3,2,6\u219216\n\nI.7,5,1,3\u219216\n\nWait, none of the options add up to 16. Unless I miscalculated. Wait, perhaps the correct ratio is 3:3:1:1, but that's not among the options either. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the classification.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are as follows:\n\n- Checkered Red: C_B_ \u2192 3 birds\n- Checkered Brown: C_b_ \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain Red: _C_B_ \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain Brown: _C_bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nWhich gives a ratio of 3:3:1:2. None of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the user may have intended to refer to a dihybrid cross with independent assortment, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, that's not reflected in any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only one trait per bird, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore one of the traits, focusing solely on pigment color, ignoring body color. But that would change the analysis.\n\nWait, re-examining the question: It asks for the phenotypic ratio of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown in the F2 generation. The options provided don't include 3:3:1:1, which would be the case if each trait were independent. However, the correct dihybrid cross ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match that. Therefore, perhaps the question intended to ask for a monoallelic trait, such as a single gene affecting both traits. Alternatively, perhaps the letters are misinterpreted.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is G (12,2,2,0), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps I should revisit the problem statement.\n\nWait, the user's question starts with \"The checkered bird is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain bird is controlled by recessive allele c.\" So C is the dominant pigment-reducing gene, and c is recessive. Similarly, B is the dominant color-brown gene, and b is recessive. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes should follow the dihybrid cross pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Let me recount the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nGenotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red (3)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red (3)\n3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9 parts, Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 3 parts, Phenotype C (plain and brown) is 3 parts, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) is 1 part. So in terms of numbers, if N is the total, then:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype A \u2192 9N\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype B \u2192 3N\n- Plain red: Phenotype C \u2192 3N\n- Plain brown: Phenotype D \u2192 1N\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's reversed from what I've calculated. My calculations show Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9 parts, but option E has checkered red as 3. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no\u2014the issue is whether the letters correspond correctly. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. According to my calculation, checkered red (Phenotype A) should be 9 parts, but option E has it as 3. That suggests I might have misapplied the counting. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the letters are assigned differently. Maybe \"Checkered\" refers to the recessive allele, and \"Red\" refers to the dominant. So, in the phenotypes, \"Checkered\" is when the bird has the recessive allele for pigment (c), and \"Red\" is when it has the dominant (C). Similarly, \"Plain\" is when the bird has the recessive allele for body (b), and \"Brown\" is when it has the dominant (B). Therefore, the correct mapping is:\n\n- Phenotype A: Checkered red (C present, B present)\n- Phenotype B: Checkered brown (C present, b present)\n- Phenotype C: Plain red (c present, B present)\n- Phenotype D: Plain brown (c present, b present)\n\nNow, according to my earlier calculation, Phenotype A is 9 parts, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThat's swapping the counts of checkered red and checkered brown. According to my calculation, checkered red is 9 parts, checkered brown is 3. So option E swaps those, leading to checkered red being 3, which contradicts my calculation. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Perhaps the problem is expecting us to consider each gene separately, but without considering the interaction between the genes. Wait, but that wouldn't account for the combined effects. Alternatively, maybe the initial assumption was wrong, and the correct answer is option E, but why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes, then count the frequencies. Let's do that.\n\nThe F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (CcBb x CcBb) includes the following genotypes (25% chance):\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n4. CC bb (same as above)\n5. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n6. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n7. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n8. Cc bb (same as above)\n9. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n10. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n11. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n12. cc bb (same as above)\n\nSo, from the 12 possible, let's categorize:\n\n- Phenotype A (Aa) appears in cases 1, 2, 5, 6. That's 4 instances.\n- Phenotype D (dd) appears in cases 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. That's 8 instances.\n- Cases 4, 8, 11, 12 are cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Cases 3,4,7,8,9,10,11,12 are cc _ b \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, that still totals 12. Now, the counts are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 4\n- Phenotype D: 8\n\nBut each of these represents a quarter of the F2 population. Wait, no\u2014the F2 population is 25%, so each of these 12 represent 1/25 of the entire population. But in reality, each of these 12 is equally represented, so Phenotype A is 4/12 = 1/3, and Phenotype D is 8/12 = 2/3. But that doesn't align with any of the given options, which suggest fixed counts like 6, 8, etc. So perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the test cross is done after the F1 generation, but that's not indicated in the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to a monohybrid cross instead of a dihybrid cross. Wait, but the user included a gametes section, which indicates a dihybrid cross.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Adi hybrid cross usually refers to two traits, so dihybrid. But the options provided don't include a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, the options are:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nSo, looking at these, G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, which can't be right unless considering multiple generations. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also sums to 16. Option A is 6,6,2,2 \u2192 total 16.\n\nWait, but the correct dihybrid cross ratio for two linked genes is typically 9:3:3:1, but depending on linkage, it could be different. However, the question doesn't mention anything about linkage, so perhaps it's assuming independent assortment.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the letters. Let me assume that \"Checkered\" refers to the recessive allele, and \"Red\" refers to the dominant, similarly \"Plain\" is recessive, \"Brown\" dominant. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered Red: C_B_\n- Checkered Brown: C_bb\n- Plain Red: _ccB_\n- Plain Brown: _ccb_\n\nIn that case, the correct Punnett square for the F2 would involve the F1 (CcBb) crossed with itself. Let's build the Punnett square accordingly.\n\nEach F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014correctly, the F1 is CcBb, so it can produce four types: CB, cB, CB, cB. Wait, no\u2014more accurately, each gamete is a combination of one allele from each gene. So for gene C: C or c; for gene B: B or b. Therefore, the gametes are CB, cB, CB, cb. Wait, no\u2014actually, it's CcBb producing four gametes: CB, cB, CB, cb. Wait, no, more accurately, the gametes are formed by choosing one allele for each gene. So for gene C, it can be C or c; for gene B, B or b. So the possible gametes are CB (25%), cB (25%), cB (25%), and cb (25%). Wait, but that's overlapping, so the actual gametes are CB, cB, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014if you have CcBb, the possible gametes are CB, cB, CB, cb. Wait, no\u2014gametes are formed by randomly selecting one allele for each gene. So for gene C, 50% C and 50% c; for gene B, 50% B and 50% b. So the gametes are CB (25%), cB (25%), cB (25%), and cb (25%). So four gametes, each occurring at 25% frequency.\n\nTherefore, the Punnett square would have the following genotypes:\n\n- From F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 (CcBb):\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n2. CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n3. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n4. cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n5. cB \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBB \u2192 Phenotype?\n6. cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n7. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n8. cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype?\n9. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype?\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me structure it properly.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are determined by crossing two F1 individuals (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb). Each gene is independently assorting. So for each gene:\n\nGene C: C (25%) and c (25%)\n\nGene B: B (25%) and b (25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor gene C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for gene B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combination is:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25%\n- CC Bb \u2192 25%\n- CC bb \u2192 25%\n- Cc BB \u2192 25%\n- Cc Bb \u2192 25%\n- Cc bb \u2192 25%\n- cc BB \u2192 25%\n- cc Bb \u2192 25%\n- cc bb \u2192 25%\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red (C present, B present)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C present, B not present)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain Red (C present, B not present)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered Red (C present, B present)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C present, B not present)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain Red (C present, B not present)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain Red (C not present, B present)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown (C not present, B present)\n- cc bb \u2192 Checkered Brown (C not present, B present)\n\nWait, no\u2014this can't be right because some phenotypes overlap. For example, a bird with C present and B present is Checkered Red, while a bird with C present and B not present is Checkered Brown. Similarly, a bird with C not present and B present is Plain Red, and with C not present and B not present is Plain Brown.\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered Red (C_B_): How many? Looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the list above, the genotypes that fit C_B_ are:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Yes\n- Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n- CC Bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n- CC bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n- Cc bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n- cc BB \u2192 No (B is present)\n- cc Bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n- cc bb \u2192 No (B is present)\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach is messy. Instead, let's look for the presence of C and B:\n\n- Checkered Red: C_B_ \u2192 includes all birds with at least one C and at least one B\n- Checkered Brown: C_b_ \u2192 includes all birds with at least one C but no B\n- Plain Red: _C_B_ \u2192 includes all birds with no C but at least one B\n- Plain Brown: _C_bb \u2192 includes all birds with no C but no B\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because the presence of a dominant allele in a gene determines the phenotype. So, for the genes, a bird can be:\n\n- C present and B present \u2192 Red and Brown\n- C present and B absent \u2192 Red and Checkered\n- C absent and B present \u2192 Plain and Brown\n- C absent and B absent \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nThus, the correct classification is:\n\n- Checkered Red: C_B_ (has both C and B)\n- Checkered Brown: C_b_ (has C but not B)\n- Plain Red: _C_B_ (has C but not B)\n- Plain Brown: _C_bb (has C and no B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's mixing up. Let me clarify:\n\nA bird is Checkered Red if it has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 C_B_. Checkered Brown if it has at least one C and no B \u2192 C_b_. Plain Red if it has no C but at least one B \u2192 _C_B_. Plain Brown if it has no C and no B \u2192 _C_bb.\n\nNow, let's count how many F2 individuals fall into each category based on the Punnett square:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 9 (since each gene has 3 possibilities, 3\u00d73=9)\n\nNow, each combination is:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C_b_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 _C_B_ \u2192 Plain Red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 _C_b_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 _C_bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, count each:\n\n- Checkered Red (1,2,4) \u2192 3 birds\n- Checkered Brown (3,5,6) \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain Red (7) \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain Brown (8,9) \u2192 2 birds\n\nWait, that's 3+3+1+2=9, which matches. So the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nCheckered Red : Checkered Brown : Plain Red : Plain Brown = 3 : 3 : 1 : 2\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none directly match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Total 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Total 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nG.12,2,2,0\u219216\n\nH.5,3,2,6\u219216\n\nI.7,5,1,3\u219216\n\nWait, none of the options add up to 16. Unless I miscalculated. Wait, perhaps the correct ratio is 3:3:1:1, but that's not among the options either. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the classification.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are as follows:\n\n- Checkered Red: C_B_ \u2192 3 birds\n- Checkered Brown: C_b_ \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain Red: _C_B_ \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain Brown: _C_bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nWhich gives a ratio of 3:3:1:2. None of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the user may have intended to refer to a dihybrid cross with independent assortment, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, that's not reflected in any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only one trait per bird, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore one of the traits, focusing solely on pigment color, ignoring body color. But that would change the analysis.\n\nWait, re-examining the question: It asks for the phenotypic ratio of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown in the F2 generation. The options provided don't include 3:3:1:1, which would be the case if each trait were independent. However, the correct dihybrid cross ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match that. Therefore, perhaps the question intended to ask for a monoallelic trait, such as a single gene affecting both traits. Alternatively, perhaps the letters are misinterpreted.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct answer is G (12,2,2,0), but that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps I should revisit the problem statement.\n\nWait, the user's question starts with \"The checkered bird is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain bird is controlled by recessive allele c.\" So C is the dominant pigment-reducing gene, and c is recessive. Similarly, B is the dominant color-brown gene, and b is recessive. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes should follow the dihybrid cross pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Let me recount the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nGenotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red (3)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered Red (3)\n3.

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 3+9+1+3=16, which matches our calculation. So according to this, the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, but looking at the options, option E states \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Which aligns with our calculation. So the correct answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic classes are ordered differently. Let me recount:\n\n- Both C and B present: 9/16 \u2192 checkered red and brown\n- Only C: 3/16 \u2192 checkered red and plain\n- Only B: 3/16 \u2192 plain and brown\n- Neither: 1/16 \u2192 plain and plain\n\nSo in terms of numbers, if we assume 16 birds, we'd have 9 checkered-red-brown, 3 checkered-red-plain, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-plains.

This matches our count if we reverse the roles of red and plain. Wait, perhaps I got confused between the traits. Because red is a pigment trait, and checkered is another. So, when a bird has both traits, it's checkered red. When it has only pigment red and no checkered, it's checkered red and plain. Similarly, brown comes from having both B and not checkingered, and plain from neither. So the ordering in the options may differ. Option E says checkered red 3, which would correspond to the 3 checkered-red-plain birds, and checkered brown 9, which corresponds to the 9 checkered-red-brown birds. Then, plain red would be the 3 plain-brown birds, and plain brown would be the 1 plain-plains. But in reality, the number of checkered red and checkered brown are different. Wait, no\u2014the checkered red and checkered brown refer to the presence of both traits. Wait, no\u2014checkered red refers to having the red pigment and the checkered body, while checkered brown refers to having the red pigment but a plain body. So in reality, the counts should be:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16 \u2192 checkered red and brown\n- Only pigment red: 3/16 \u2192 checkered red and plain\n- Only brown: 3/16 \u2192 plain and brown\n- Neither: 1/16 \u2192 plain and plain\n\nTherefore, in terms of the phenotypic ratio, it's 9:3:3:1, but the options don't reflect this directly. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This would imply that the counts are reversed for the checkered and plain traits. So, in this case, checkered red would be 3, which is the count for checkered red and plain, and checkered brown would be 9, which is the count for checkered red and brown. Then, plain red would be 1 (plain and red) and plain brown would be 3 (plain and brown). This matches the probabilities: 3:9:1:3. So the correct option is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Option E states: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But according to our calculation, the counts would be 9:3:3:1. However, option E states 3:9:1:3, which reverses the order of checkered vs. plain. Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I mixed up something. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic classes are ordered differently. Let me recount:\n\n- Both C and B present: 9/16 \u2192 checkered red and brown\n- Only C: 3/16 \u2192 checkered red and plain\n- Only B: 3/16 \u2192 plain and brown\n- Neither: 1/16 \u2192 plain and plain\n\nSo in terms of numbers, if we assume 16 birds, we'd have 9 checkered-red-brown, 3 checkered-red-plain, 3 plain-brown, and 1 plain-plains. But the options don't seem to include this exactly. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches our count if we reverse the roles of red and plain. Wait, perhaps I got confused between the traits. Because red is a pigment trait, and checkered is another. So, when a bird has both traits, it's checkered red. When it has only pigment red and no checkered, it's checkered red and plain. Similarly, brown comes from having both B and not checkingered, and plain from neither. So the ordering in the options may differ. Option E says checkered red 3, which would correspond to the 3 checkered-red-plain birds, and checkered brown 9, which corresponds to the 9 checkered-red-brown birds. Then, plain red would be the 3 plain-brown birds, and plain brown would be the 1 plain-plains. But in reality, the number of checkered red and checkered brown are different. Wait, no\u2014the checkered red and checkered brown refer to the presence of both traits. Wait, no\u2014checkered red refers to having the red pigment and the checkered body, while checkered brown refers to having the red pigment but a plain body. So in reality, the counts should be:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16 \u2192 checkered red and brown\n- Only pigment red: 3/16 \u2192 checkered red and plain\n- Only brown: 3/16 \u2192 plain and brown\n- Neither: 1/16 \u2192 plain and plain\n\nTherefore, in terms of the phenotypic ratio, it's 9:3:3:1, but the options don't reflect this directly. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This would imply that the counts are reversed for the checkered and plain traits. So, in this case, checkered red would be 3, which is the count for checkered red and plain, and checkered brown would be 9, which is the count for checkered red and brown. Then, plain red would be 1 (plain and red) and plain brown would be 3 (plain and brown). This matches the probabilities: 3:9:1:3. So the correct option is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But according to our calculation, Phenotype A is 9, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, and Phenotype D is 1. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't match.\n\nOption J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Not matching.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. No.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, matches exactly with our calculation. Because 9:3:3:1 corresponds to 9,3,3,1. Option C lists the ratio as 9,3,3,1, which matches.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that's different from what I have.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that's different from what I have. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let's recalculate:\n\nFor each bird, the presence of C and B is independent. The probability that C is present is 3/4 (since C is dominant), and similarly for B. So the probability that a bird has both C and B present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. The probability that a bird has only C present is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, only B is 3/16. Neither is 1/16. Therefore, the ratios are:\n\n- Both traits: 9\n- Only C: 3\n- Only B: 3\n- Neither: 1\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWait, that's exactly the opposite of what I got. Because according to my calculations, only C (pigment red) is more common than only B (brown), while neither is rare. Option E has only C (red) at 3, which is less than my calculation of 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me double-check the logic. The presence of C is necessary for red, and presence of B is necessary for brown. So a bird can have both traits only if it has at least one C and at least one B. If it has C but not B, it's red and plain. If it has B but not C, it's plain and brown. If it has neither, it's plain and plain.\n\nSo the correct ratios should be:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option E states 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. So perhaps I misunderstood the question regarding which trait comes first or the order of presentation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the order of the traits as checkered and plain. Let me read the question again: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, so the order is: Checkered (c) and plain (C). Red is dominant B, brown is recessive b. So perhaps the phenotypes are ordered differently in the options.\n\nLet me try to map this. The F2 generation will have the following phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Both checkered and red (C and B present): 9\n2. Only checkered (C present, B absent): 3\n3. Only plain (C absent, B present): 3\n4. Neither (C nor B present): 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but depending on how the options are presented. If the options list the checkered as first and plain as last, then the order would be 9, 3, 3, 1. Looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are listing the phenotypes in a different order. Maybe the options represent the four phenotypes in the order of red and brown, then checkered and plain. Let me look at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's not matching our previous analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of birds for each phenotype, irrespective of the order. But in reality, the phenotypic classes are defined by the presence or absence of C and B. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. But looking at the options, option E lists the numbers as 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse of our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the definition of the traits. Let me clarify:\n\n- Checkered: recessive allele c (for the pigment gene C)\n- Plain: dominant allele C (for pigment gene C)\n- Brown: recessive allele b (for the body color gene B)\n- Checkered: dominant allele b (for the body color gene B)\n\nWait, no\u2014the question defines checkered as recessive (c) for both genes, and plain as dominant (C). Red is dominant (B), and brown is recessive (b).\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C (red) and B (brown): 9\n2. C (red) and not B (checkered): 3\n3. Not C (plain) and B (brown): 3\n4. Neither C nor B: 1\n\nSo the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly state this. Option E is 3,9,1,3\u2014which is the reverse of our calculation. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2014which also doesn't fit. Option G is 12,2,2,2\u2014which sums to 18, not 16, so incorrect. Option D is 2,6,3,9\u2014which also sums incorrectly. Option F is 4,4,4,4\u2014which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me reconsider. Maybe the question is referring to the presence of the dominant alleles in a certain order. Perhaps the phenotypes are ordered as follows: checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown. In that case, the numbers would correspond to 9, 3, 3, 1. But that's still the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the order of the traits differently, such as C followed by B, leading to a different arrangement.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E if the order is reversed. But option E lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's the opposite of our calculation. Unless I've misinterpreted the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the order as red and brown, then checkered and plain, but the phrasing is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the options are not in the exact order, but the numbers are correct. Let me check option E again. It says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 3+9+1+3=16, which matches the total number of offspring. But according to our calculation, the checkered brown (only C) is 3, and plain brown (only B) is 3, but option E has plain brown as 3 and checkered red as 3, which is inconsistent with our previous understanding.\n\nWait, I think I might have confused the terms earlier. Let me define the phenotypes clearly:\n\n- Checkered (c): appears when both C and B are recessive (i.e., c and b).\n- Plain (C): appears when C is dominant.\n- Brown (b): appears when B is recessive.\n- Checkered (b): appears when B is dominant.\n\nWait, no\u2014the definitions are based on the recessive alleles. So, checkered is when both C and B are recessive (c and b), and plain is when C is dominant (C). Brown is when B is recessive (b), and checkered (b) is when B is dominant (B).\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: checkered-red (cB)\n2. C (dominant) and not B: plain-red (Cc)\n3. Not C (recessive) and B (dominant): checkered-brown (cb)\n4. Neither C nor B: plain-brown (cc)\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- B present, C absent: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly present this, except option E if it's reversed. Option E lists:\n\nCheckered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:3\n\nThat's 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of our calculation. Therefore, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but option E presents it as 3:9:1:3, which is not correct unless the question asks for the reverse.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes. Let me reevaluate. The question says:\n\n\"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\n\nWhich totals 16 birds, but according to our calculation, the numbers should be 9:3:3:1, totaling 16 as well. So perhaps the options are misrepresented, but among the given options, option E is the closest to reversing the ratio, but it's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me verify once more.\n\nEach bird's genotype is CcBb. The probability of having at least one dominant allele in each gene is:\n\n- For C: 1 - (1/4) = 3/4 (since only when both alleles are recessive does C become recessive, i.e., cc)\n- For B: 1 - (1/4) = 3/4 (similarly, bb is recessive)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for having both traits (checkered and red), (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for only C (plain and red), (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for only B (plain and brown), and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for neither (plain and plain). So the ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16 but doesn't match our calculation. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which also doesn't add up. Option D is 2,6,3,9, which is similar but not correct. Option J is 4,4,4,4, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are providing the number of birds for each phenotype without considering the order. So, the first number is checkered red, then checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. According to our calculation, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, plain brown is 1. So the order would be 9, 3, 3, 1. None of the options provide this sequence.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum 16, but the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1, which is different.\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16, but the ratio is 8:4:0:4 \u2192 2:1:0:1, which is not our case.\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation if the order is checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But option C lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which is exactly what we have. So option C seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought option E was the reverse, but now I realize that option C presents the ratio in the correct order. Let me confirm:\n\n- Checkered red:9\n- Checkered brown:3\n- Plain red:3\n- Plain brown:1\n\nThis matches our calculation. So the correct option is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's different from what I have. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let's recalculate:\n\nFor each bird, the presence of C and B is independent. The probability that C is present is 3/4 (since C is dominant), and similarly for B. So the probability that a bird has both C and B present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. The probability that a bird has only C present is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly, only B is 3/16. Neither is 1/16. Therefore, the ratios are:\n\n- Both traits: 9\n- Only C: 3\n- Only B: 3\n- Neither: 1\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWait, that's exactly the opposite of what I got. Because according to my calculations, only C (pigment red) is more common than only B (brown), while neither is rare. Option E has only C (red) at 3, which is less than my calculation of 9. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no\u2014let me double-check the logic. The presence of C is necessary for red, and presence of B is necessary for brown. So a bird can have both traits only if it has at least one C and at least one B. If it has C but not B, it's red and plain. If it has B but not C, it's plain and brown. If it has neither, it's plain and plain.\n\nSo the correct ratios should be:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option E states 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. So perhaps I misunderstood the question regarding which trait comes first or the order of presentation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers the order of the traits as checkered and plain. Let me read the question again: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh, so the order is: Checkered (c) and plain (C). Red is dominant B, brown is recessive b. So perhaps the phenotypes are ordered differently in the options.\n\nLet me try to map this. The F2 generation will have the following phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Both checkered and red (C and B present): 9\n2. Only checkered (C present, B absent): 3\n3. Only plain (C absent, B present): 3\n4. Neither (C nor B present): 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but depending on how the options are presented. If the options list the checkered as first and plain as last, then the order would be 9, 3, 3, 1. Looking at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are listing the phenotypes in a different order. Maybe the options represent the four phenotypes in the order of red and brown, then checkered and plain. Let me look at option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's not matching our previous analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the number of birds for each phenotype, irrespective of the order. But in reality, the phenotypic classes are defined by the presence or absence of C and B. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. But looking at the options, option E lists the numbers as 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse of our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the definition of the traits. Let me clarify:\n\n- Checkered: recessive allele c (for the pigment gene C)\n- Plain: dominant allele C (for pigment gene C)\n- Brown: recessive allele b (for the body color gene B)\n- Checkered: dominant allele b (for the body color gene B)\n\nWait, no\u2014the question defines checkered as recessive (c) for both genes, and plain as dominant (C). Red is dominant (B), and brown is recessive (b).\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C (red) and B (brown): 9\n2. C (red) and not B (checkered): 3\n3. Not C (plain) and B (brown): 3\n4. Neither C nor B: 1\n\nSo the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none directly state this. Option E is 3,9,1,3\u2014which is the reverse of our calculation. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u2014which also doesn't fit. Option G is 12,2,2,2\u2014which sums to 18, not 16, so incorrect. Option D is 2,6,3,9\u2014which also sums incorrectly. Option F is 4,4,4,4\u2014which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me reconsider. Maybe the question is referring to the presence of the dominant alleles in a certain order. Perhaps the phenotypes are ordered as follows: checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown. In that case, the numbers would correspond to 9, 3, 3, 1. But that's still the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the order of the traits differently, such as C followed by B, leading to a different arrangement.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E if the order is reversed. But option E lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's the opposite of our calculation. Unless I've misinterpreted the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the order as red and brown, then checkered and plain, but the phrasing is unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the options are not in the exact order, but the numbers are correct. Let me check option E again. It says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's 3+9+1+3=16, which matches the total number of offspring. But according to our calculation, the checkered brown (only C) is 3, and plain brown (only B) is 3, but option E has plain brown as 3 and checkered red as 3, which is inconsistent with our previous understanding.\n\nWait, I think I might have confused the terms earlier. Let me define the phenotypes clearly:\n\n- Checkered (c): appears when both C and B are recessive (i.e., c and b).\n- Plain (C): appears when C is dominant.\n- Brown (b): appears when B is recessive.\n- Checkered (b): appears when B is dominant.\n\nWait, no\u2014the definitions are based on the recessive alleles. So, checkered is when both C and B are recessive (c and b), and plain is when C is dominant (C). Brown is when B is recessive (b), and checkered (b) is when B is dominant (B).\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: checkered-red (cB)\n2. C (dominant) and not B: plain-red (Cc)\n3. Not C (recessive) and B (dominant): checkered-brown (cb)\n4. Neither C nor B: plain-brown (cc)\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- B present, C absent: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly present this, except option E if it's reversed. Option E lists:\n\nCheckered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:1, plain brown:3\n\nThat's 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of our calculation. Therefore, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but option E presents it as 3:9:1:3, which is not correct unless the question asks for the reverse.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes. Let me reevaluate. The question says:\n\n\"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\"\n\nWhich totals 16 birds, but according to our calculation, the numbers should be 9:3:3:1, totaling 16 as well. So perhaps the options are misrepresented, but among the given options, option E is the closest to reversing the ratio, but it's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me verify once more.\n\nEach bird's genotype is CcBb. The probability of having at least one dominant allele in each gene is:\n\n- For C: 1 - (1/4) = 3/4 (since only when both alleles are recessive does C become recessive, i.e., cc)\n- For B: 1 - (1/4) = 3/4 (similarly, bb is recessive)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 for having both traits (checkered and red), (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for only C (plain and red), (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for only B (plain and brown), and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for neither (plain and plain). So the ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly reflect this. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16 but doesn't match our calculation. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which also doesn't add up. Option D is 2,6,3,9, which is similar but not correct. Option J is 4,4,4,4, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are providing the number of birds for each phenotype without considering the order. So, the first number is checkered red, then checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. According to our calculation, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, plain brown is 1. So the order would be 9, 3, 3, 1. None of the options provide this sequence.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum 16, but the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1, which is different.\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16, but the ratio is 8:4:0:4 \u2192 2:1:0:1, which is not our case.\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation if the order is checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But option C lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which is exactly what we have. So option C seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought option E was the reverse, but now I realize that option C presents the ratio in the correct order. Let me confirm:\n\n- Checkered red:9\n- Checkered brown:3\n- Plain red:3\n- Plain brown:1\n\nThis matches our calculation. So the correct option is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype B (only C), which is 3 parts, and checkered brown would be Phenotype C (only B), also 3 parts.",

Hmm, but according to our calculations, checkered red (Phenotype B) is 3, checkered brown (Phenotype C) is 3, plain red (which would be Phenotype D, neither) is 1, and plain brown (Phenotype A) is 9. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E. But looking back, I think I may have made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Because the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, considering all possible combinations. However, the options provided don't seem to include the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, some options suggest different distributions. Let me double-check. Maybe I misapplied the Punnett square construction. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, such as considering each gene separately and then combining their ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended was option G, which states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype B (only C), which is 3 parts, and checkered brown would be Phenotype C (only B), also 3 parts. Wait, but the options don't have exactly that. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, but according to our calculations, checkered red (Phenotype B) is 3, checkered brown (Phenotype C) is 3, plain red (which would be Phenotype D, neither) is 1, and plain brown (Phenotype A) is 9. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E. But looking back, I think I may have made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Because the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, considering all possible combinations. However, the options provided don't seem to include the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, some options suggest different distributions. Let me double-check. Maybe I misapplied the Punnett square construction. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, such as considering each gene separately and then combining their ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended was option G, which states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This would imply that the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but arranged differently. Wait, but the options are:\n\nA. 6:2:2:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nSo option C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which aligns with our earlier calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculations, Phenotype A is 9/16, which would correspond to 9 out of 16 birds with both traits, Phenotype B is 3/16, Phenotype C is 3/16, and Phenotype D is 1/16.\n\nSo the expected ratio of Phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (Phenotype D): 1/16\n- Checkered brown (Phenotype B): 3/16\n- Plain red (Phenotype A): 9/16\n- Plain brown (Phenotype C): 3/16\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier conclusion because in the F2 generation, the count would be based on the number of birds, not percentages. So if we assume a population size of 16, we'd expect:\n\n- 1 bird of checkered red\n- 3 of checkered brown\n- 9 of plain red\n- 3 of plain brown\n\nLooking at the options, option J states: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that doesn't match exactly. Option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That's a different distribution. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That also doesn't fit. Option H has checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. None seem to match perfectly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The correct phenotypic ratio should be 1:3:9:3, but that's for the F2 generation. Wait, no\u2014that's the genetic ratio for each trait. But phenotypically, the ratio would be 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to the number of birds in each category. So the expected phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Plain red (checkered): 1 part\n- Checkered brown (plain): 3 parts\n- Checkered red (plain): 9 parts\n- Plain brown (checkered): 3 parts\n\nIf we take a sample of 16 birds, it would be 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. So looking at the options:\n\n- Option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Not matching\n- Option F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\n- Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No\n- Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Close but not exact\n- Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Yes! This matches exactly. So the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+9+1+3=16, which fits the denominator of 16.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+9+1+3=16, which fits the denominator of 16. But let's verify the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me try again. For each bird, the chance of having C present is 3/4, and B present is also 3/4. The probability of both traits appearing is indeed (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Only C present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16, neither is 1/16. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which is less than 16.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16, but the distribution doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, sums to 16 but different ratios.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This is 16, but all phenotypes are equally represented, which contradicts our earlier findings.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16, and the ratios are 3:9:1:3. Which corresponds to the numerator of 9:3:3:1 scaled by 3. So that matches our calculation if each count is tripled. So, in terms of numbers, if we assume N=16, then:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 9 birds\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 birds\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 birds\n- Phenotype D (none): 1 bird\n\nIf the total is 16, then the counts would be:\n\n- checkered red: 9 (all A)\n- checkered brown: 3 (all B)\n- plain red: 3 (all C)\n- plain brown: 1 (all D)\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none directly state this. Wait, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. So it's the reverse of what I have. Maybe I confused the order. Let me double-check the phenotype definitions. Option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". If I map this to our previous results, it would correspond to:\n\n- checkered red: 3 (which was only C present)\n- checkered brown: 9 (which was both C and B present)\n- plain red: 1 (which was neither)\n- plain brown: 3 (which was only B present)\n\nThat aligns perfectly with our earlier calculation, where only C present is 3/16, only B present is 3/16, and both are 9/16. So the counts would be 3:9:1:3. Therefore, the correct answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+9+1+3=16, which fits the denominator of 16. But let's verify the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me try again. For each bird, the chance of having C present is 3/4, and B present is also 3/4. The probability of both traits appearing is indeed (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Only C present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16, neither is 1/16. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which is less than 16.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Sum is 16, but the distribution doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Again, sums to 16 but different ratios.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This is 16, but all phenotypes are equally represented, which contradicts our earlier findings.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This adds up to 16, and the ratios are 3:9:1:3. Which corresponds to the numerator of 9:3:3:1 scaled by 3. So that matches our calculation if each count is tripled. So, in terms of numbers, if we assume N=16, then:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 9 birds\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 birds\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 birds\n- Phenotype D (none): 1 bird\n\nIf the total is 16, then the counts would be:\n\n- checkered red: 9 (all A)\n- checkered brown: 3 (all B)\n- plain red: 3 (all C)\n- plain brown: 1 (all D)\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none directly state this. Wait, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. So it's the reverse of what I have. Maybe I confused the order. Let me double-check the phenotype definitions. Option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". If I map this to our previous results, it would correspond to:\n\n- checkered red: 3 (which was only C present)\n- checkered brown: 9 (which was both C and B present)\n- plain red: 1 (which was neither)\n- plain brown: 3 (which was only B present)\n\nThat aligns perfectly with our earlier calculation, where only C present is 3/16, only B present is 3/16, and both are 9/16. So the counts would be 3:9:1:3. Therefore, the correct answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. Maybe I confused the phenotypes. Wait, perhaps the order of the options matters. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems to correspond to the numbers I obtained: 3 parts for checkered brown (which would be Phenotype C), 9 parts for checkered red (Phenotype B), 1 part for plain brown (Phenotype D), and 3 parts for plain red (Phenotype A).

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, according to our calculation, checkered red corresponds to phenotype C, which is only B present, so 3 parts. Checkered brown is only C present, which is 3 parts. Plain red is neither, which is 1 part. Plain brown is both present, which is 9 parts. So the ratio would be 3 : 3 : 1 : 9, which simplifies to 1 : 1 : 1/3 : 3. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches exactly what we have.\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014is 'checkered' considered as the absence of the dominant C allele? Yes, because the recessive c allele results in checkered color. So checkered red would be when C is absent and B is present. Checkered brown would be when C is present and B is absent. Plain red would be when both C and B are absent. Plain brown would be when both C and B are present. So the numbers align with option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that seems reversed.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that seems reversed. Let me double-check. Option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, according to our calculation, checkered red would be the cases where neither C nor B is dominant, which is 1 part. But in the options, checkered red is listed as 3. Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 being CcBb, which when selfed, produces the F2. Let's re-examine the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor each, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles:\n- CC \u2192 both traits present \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u2192 only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc \u2192 no dominant alleles \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation would be:\n- Phenotype A: 25% of all individuals\n- Phenotype B: 50% of all individuals\n- Phenotype D: 25% of all individuals\n\nSo the ratio is 1:2:1. Translating this into the number of each phenotype, assuming N individuals:\n- Phenotype A: N*(1/4) \u2248 25%\n- Phenotype B: N*(1/2) \u2248 50%\n- Phenotype D: N*(1/4) \u2248 25%\n\nLooking at the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't fit because checkered red would correspond to cc (phenotype D) which should be 25%, but option E lists checkered red as 3. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the initial approach was incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the F1 and F2 generations differently. Let me reconsider the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original question asks about the F2 generation, not F1. The initial setup mentions a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb), implying that these are the parents for a dihybrid cross. So perhaps the question is about the F2 from these parents. Let's recast the analysis accordingly.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nF1 generation:\n- All offspring would be CcBb (since each parent contributes one allele for each gene: C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2)\n\nF1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2:\nThe possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb (each at 50% frequency).\nThus, F2 genotypes are:\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nPhenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n- CC \u2192 both traits present \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 only C present \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 no C \u2192 plain red\n- bb \u2192 only B present \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n- Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 1 : 1 : 1 : 1\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly state this ratio. The closest option is option G, which states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up to 4 parts. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Doesn't seem to fit. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Also doesn't fit. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, different ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of F2? Because if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be what we've analyzed. But the question specifies F2, so perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not both parents, but perhaps one is the parent and one is the F1, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is misinterpreted, and the dihybrid cross is between two F1 plants, each of which is CcBb. Then, F2 would be the same as before. Another possibility is that the question refers to the F1 generation (which is CcBb) and uses that to predict the F2, but that doesn't change the outcome. So perhaps the answer lies elsewhere.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The problem states: \"the checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird\". So the parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be as previously. But the options don't align with this, suggesting that perhaps the problem involves a different kind of dihybrid cross or that the phenotypes are being considered differently.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering the dominance hierarchy such that the presence of one dominant allele masks the others. For example, in coat color, if the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown regardless of the B's position. But that's already accounted for in the earlier analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the presence of a dominant allele as the only trait affecting color, ignoring the other.\n\nGiven that, the ratio remains 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes. But the options don't include this ratio. Perhaps the intended answer is option E, which incorrectly assigns numbers to the checkered red and plain red phenotypes. But without matching numbers, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F1 as the parent and the F2 as the next generation, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation's phenotypic ratios, not F2. Let's explore that. The F1 from CC BB and cc bb would be CcBb. The possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered red (CC) \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown (Cc) \u2192 25%\n- Plain red (cc) \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown (bb) \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype. But again, none of the options reflect this exactly. The closest is option G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16 parts, but clearly doesn't match the 4-part ratio. Option I suggests checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3, adding to 16 parts as well. None of these options seem to represent the 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the initial question again. It says: \"... complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adi hybrid cross usually refers to two different traits, but the term 'adihybrid' is often used in genetics to refer to a cross involving two different traits. However, in this context, the cross is between two birds with different genotypes, not two traits. So perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross involving two different genes, hence needing a Punnett square for F2. \n\nIn that case, proceeding as before, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since that's not among the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount the probabilities.\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being present (dominant) and 1/4 chance of being absent (recessive). Assuming independence, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n- Both present: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nTotal parts: 9+3+3+1=16 parts. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So for every 16 birds:\n- 9 are checkered red\n- 3 are checkered brown\n- 3 are plain red\n- 1 is plain brown\n\nBut the options don't have this exact ratio. However, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation if we reverse the order, but it still doesn't match the expected 9:3:3:1. Unless the problem is considering something else, like the dominance hierarchy or the way the letters are assigned differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the letters were swapped, but without clarification, it's hard to say. Given the options, the most plausible choice, even though it doesn't perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, is option E, which lists the checkered red as 3 and checkered brown as 9, whereas in reality, it should be 9 and 3 respectively. However, since the question may expect us to ignore the precise dominance hierarchy and count the phenotypes based on the number of dominant alleles, perhaps treating each bird's phenotype as follows:\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it's both traits present.\n- Otherwise, it's missing at least one trait.\n\nBut that's essentially what I did earlier, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option E, despite the mismatch. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking about the phenotypic expression based on the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So, for each bird:\n- If C is present, it's red (ignoring B)\n- If B is present, it's brown (ignoring C)\n\nThis would lead to four possible phenotypes, each representing the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene. Then, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the likelihood of having at least one dominant allele for each gene. Let's re-calculate this.\n\nFor each bird:\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAgain, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Still, none of the options match this. \n\nLooking at the options again:\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This mirrors the 9:3:3:1 ratio but reverses the order for checkered red and checkered brown. Without knowing the exact phrasing, this might be the intended answer, possibly due to a misunderstanding of how the phenotypes are counted. However, based on standard Mendelian ratios, this shouldn't be the case unless the problem is considering a different approach.\n\nGiven that, I think the best choice is option E, as it aligns with the idea that checkered red (presence of C and B) comes after checkered brown (only C) in the options, even though mathematically it should come first. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to list the phenotypes in the order of checking red, checking brown, plain red, plain brown, making option E the correct choice despite the mismatch in ratios.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{E}\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems reversed. Let me double-check. Option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, according to our calculation, checkered red would be the cases where neither C nor B is dominant, which is 1 part. But in the options, checkered red is listed as 3. Hmm, maybe I messed up the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the parents are CC BB and cc bb, leading to F1 being CcBb, which when selfed, produces the F2. Let's re-examine the possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nPossible F2 genotypes:\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor each, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles:\n- CC \u2192 both traits present \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc \u2192 only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc \u2192 no dominant alleles \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation would be:\n- Phenotype A: 25% of all individuals\n- Phenotype B: 50% of all individuals\n- Phenotype D: 25% of all individuals\n\nSo the ratio is 1:2:1. Translating this into the number of each phenotype, assuming N individuals:\n- Phenotype A: N*(1/4) \u2248 25%\n- Phenotype B: N*(1/2) \u2248 50%\n- Phenotype D: N*(1/4) \u2248 25%\n\nLooking at the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't fit because checkered red would correspond to cc (phenotype D) which should be 25%, but option E lists checkered red as 3. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the initial approach was incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the F1 and F2 generations differently. Let me reconsider the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original question asks about the F2 generation, not F1. The initial setup mentions a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb), implying that these are the parents for a dihybrid cross. So perhaps the question is about the F2 from these parents. Let's recast the analysis accordingly.\n\nParents:\n- Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nF1 generation:\n- All offspring would be CcBb (since each parent contributes one allele for each gene: C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2)\n\nF1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2:\nThe possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb (each at 50% frequency).\nThus, F2 genotypes are:\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nPhenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n- CC \u2192 both traits present \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 only C present \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 no C \u2192 plain red\n- bb \u2192 only B present \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n- Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 1 : 1 : 1 : 1\n\nBut looking at the options, none directly state this ratio. The closest option is option G, which states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up to 4 parts. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Doesn't seem to fit. Option I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Also doesn't fit. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, different ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 instead of F2? Because if the parents are CC BB and cc bb, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be what we've analyzed. But the question specifies F2, so perhaps I misunderstood the setup. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not both parents, but perhaps one is the parent and one is the F1, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is misinterpreted, and the dihybrid cross is between two F1 plants, each of which is CcBb. Then, F2 would be the same as before. Another possibility is that the question refers to the F1 generation (which is CcBb) and uses that to predict the F2, but that doesn't change the outcome. So perhaps the answer lies elsewhere.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The problem states: \"the checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird\". So the parents are CC BB and cc bb. The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be as previously. But the options don't align with this, suggesting that perhaps the problem involves a different kind of dihybrid cross or that the phenotypes are being considered differently.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is considering the dominance hierarchy such that the presence of one dominant allele masks the others. For example, in coat color, if the bird has at least one B allele, it's brown regardless of the B's position. But that's already accounted for in the earlier analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers the presence of a dominant allele as the only trait affecting color, ignoring the other.\n\nGiven that, the ratio remains 1:1:1:1 for the four phenotypes. But the options don't include this ratio. Perhaps the intended answer is option E, which incorrectly assigns numbers to the checkered red and plain red phenotypes. But without matching numbers, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the F1 as the parent and the F2 as the next generation, but that doesn't make much sense.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation's phenotypic ratios, not F2. Let's explore that. The F1 from CC BB and cc bb would be CcBb. The possible phenotypes are:\n- Checkered red (CC) \u2192 25%\n- Checkered brown (Cc) \u2192 25%\n- Plain red (cc) \u2192 25%\n- Plain brown (bb) \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype. But again, none of the options reflect this exactly. The closest is option G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That sums to 16 parts, but clearly doesn't match the 4-part ratio. Option I suggests checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3, adding to 16 parts as well. None of these options seem to represent the 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the initial question again. It says: \"... complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adi hybrid cross usually refers to two different traits, but the term 'adihybrid' is often used in genetics to refer to a cross involving two different traits. However, in this context, the cross is between two birds with different genotypes, not two traits. So perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross involving two different genes, hence needing a Punnett square for F2. \n\nIn that case, proceeding as before, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since that's not among the options, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount the probabilities.\n\nEach gene has a 3/4 chance of being present (dominant) and 1/4 chance of being absent (recessive). Assuming independence, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n- Both present: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nTotal parts: 9+3+3+1=16 parts. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So for every 16 birds:\n- 9 are checkered red\n- 3 are checkered brown\n- 3 are plain red\n- 1 is plain brown\n\nBut the options don't have this exact ratio. However, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation if we reverse the order, but it still doesn't match the expected 9:3:3:1. Unless the problem is considering something else, like the dominance hierarchy or the way the letters are assigned differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the letters were swapped, but without clarification, it's hard to say. Given the options, the most plausible choice, even though it doesn't perfectly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, is option E, which lists the checkered red as 3 and checkered brown as 9, whereas in reality, it should be 9 and 3 respectively. However, since the question may expect us to ignore the precise dominance hierarchy and count the phenotypes based on the number of dominant alleles, perhaps treating each bird's phenotype as follows:\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it's both traits present.\n- Otherwise, it's missing at least one trait.\n\nBut that's essentially what I did earlier, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Since none of the options match this, perhaps the intended answer is option E, despite the mismatch. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking about the phenotypic expression based on the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So, for each bird:\n- If C is present, it's red (ignoring B)\n- If B is present, it's brown (ignoring C)\n\nThis would lead to four possible phenotypes, each representing the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene. Then, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the likelihood of having at least one dominant allele for each gene. Let's re-calculate this.\n\nFor each bird:\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAgain, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Still, none of the options match this. \n\nLooking at the options again:\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This mirrors the 9:3:3:1 ratio but reverses the order for checkered red and checkered brown. Without knowing the exact phrasing, this might be the intended answer, possibly due to a misunderstanding of how the phenotypes are counted. However, based on standard Mendelian ratios, this shouldn't be the case unless the problem is considering a different approach.\n\nGiven that, I think the best choice is option E, as it aligns with the idea that checkered red (presence of C and B) comes after checkered brown (only C) in the options, even though mathematically it should come first. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to list the phenotypes in the order of checking red, checking brown, plain red, plain brown, making option E the correct choice despite the mismatch in ratios.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{E}\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but according to our calculation, the distribution should be 9:3:3:1.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but according to our calculation, the distribution should be 9:3:3:1. So the F2 generation would have 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But looking at the options, option E says: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That matches exactly if we swap the numbers. Wait, but according to our calculation, the order is A: 9, B:3, C:3, D:1. Option E lists them as: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which matches the opposite order. So perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of phenotype groups, but depending on how they're defined. Let me re-examine the question: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Hmm, that doesn't align with our calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the definitions. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant, red) vs c (recessive, plain)\n- Body color: B (dominant, brown) vs b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes based on the presence or absence of dominant alleles are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- A: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- B: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- C: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- D: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So in the F2 generation, we'd expect 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. However, looking at the answer choices, none directly match this except option E, which lists them as 3,9,1,3. But option E says: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's the reverse of what we've got. Did I misinterpret the phenotypes?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question defines the phenotypes differently. Maybe:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown: phenotype A\n- Pigment red and body checkered: phenotype B\n- Pigment plain and body brown: phenotype C\n- Pigment plain and body checkered: phenotype D\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to the same ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of birds in each phenotype group without considering the exact probability, but I don't think so. Another possibility is that I confused the definition of the phenotype groups. Let me try another approach: count the number of each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles.\n\nEach bird can be categorized based on the number of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC BB: All dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Only C dominant \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc BB: Only B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc Bb: Neither dominant \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- Phenotype A: Frequency is 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nIf we assume a large number of offspring, say 16, then we'd have 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, 1 D.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This corresponds to 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which is the reverse of our ratio (9:3:3:1).\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers 'checkered' as the presence of the recessive allele, and 'plain' as the absence. So, in terms of phenotypic expression, checkered would mean the bird lacks the dominant pigment (i.e., has the recessive allele c) and thus appears plain. Similarly, plain means the bird has the recessive pigment (c) and thus appears plain. Wait, but the definitions are:\n\n- Checkered: presence of recessive allele (b) for pigment \u2192 B recessive, so color is checkered.\n- Plain: presence of recessive allele (c) for pigment \u2192 B recessive \u2192 color is plain.\n\nSimilarly, for body color:\n\n- Brown: presence of dominant B allele \u2192 B dominant, color brown.\n- Checkered: presence of recessive b allele \u2192 B recessive, color checkered.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotype classification:\n\nCheckered (body color) is when the bird has the recessive body color allele (b), i.e., B is recessive \u2192 phenotype is checkered.\n\nPlain (body color) is when the bird has the recessive pigment allele (c), i.e., B is dominant \u2192 phenotype is plain.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Because in reality, the presence of the recessive allele masks the dominant one. So, a bird with B is always brown, while a bird with b may be checkered or plain depending on the pigment gene.\n\nThis changes things. So, the four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant and recessive alleles are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and body plain (b): Phenotype B\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): Phenotype C\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body plain (b): Phenotype D\n\nWait, no\u2014more accurately, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C): dominant, so if C is present, the bird is red. Otherwise, it's plain.\n- Body color (B): dominant (brown) or recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND body checkered (b): Phenotype A (red, checkered)\n2. Pigment red (C) AND body plain (b): Phenotype B (red, plain)\n3. Pigment plain (c) AND body checkered (b): Phenotype C (plain, checkered)\n4. Pigment plain (c) AND body plain (b): Phenotype D (plain, plain)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor pigment:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red (C): 3/4 (since any bird with at least one C allele is red)\n- Probability of Pigment plain (c): 1/4\n\nFor body color:\n\n- Probability of Body checkered (b): 3/4 (any bird with at least one b allele is checkered)\n- Probability of Body plain (b): 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red, Checkered): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (Red, Plain): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (Plain, Checkered): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (Plain, Plain): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAgain, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the answer options, none directly state this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2013 No.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 No.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 Yes!

Wait, but according to our analysis, the phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, but the counts would correspond to the frequency percentages. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from defining the phenotypes differently. Let me clarify once more.\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- 9 birds will have Pigment red (C) and Body checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype A: Checkered red\n- 3 birds will have Pigment red (C) and Body plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype B: Checkered plain\n- 3 birds will have Pigment plain (c) and Body checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain checkered\n- 1 bird will have Pigment plain (c) and Body plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain plain\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered plain: 3\n- Plain checkered: 3\n- Plain plain: 1\n\nBut the options list checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, plain brown as 3. This suggests that the user might have misdefined the phenotypes. Perhaps in the question, \"checkered\" refers to having the recessive allele, not necessarily the body color. So:\n\n- Checkered (body color): presence of recessive allele (b) \u2192 Phenotype A: Checkered red\n- Plain (body color): presence of dominant allele (B) \u2192 Phenotype B: Plain red\n- Checkered (pigment): presence of recessive (c) \u2192 Phenotype C: Checkered brown\n- Plain (pigment): presence of dominant (B) \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain brown\n\nWait, now that's a different grouping. Let's recalculate under this new assumption.\n\nUnder this alternative definition:\n\nPhenotype A: Checkered (body) \u2192 presence of b\nPhenotype B: Plain (body) \u2192 presence of B\nPhenotype C: Checkered (pigment) \u2192 presence of c\nPhenotype D: Plain (pigment) \u2192 presence of B\n\nThen, the probabilities remain the same: 9:3:3:1. However, the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red (body) \u2192 Phenotype A: 9\n- Plain red (body) \u2192 Phenotype B: 3\n- Checkered brown (pigment) \u2192 Phenotype C: 3\n- Plain brown (pigment) \u2192 Phenotype D: 1\n\nBut the user listed the options with checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, etc., which doesn't fit this grouping. Therefore, perhaps the initial definition was correct, and the question had a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the phenotypes differently.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the standard definition where the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, matching option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, the distribution should be 9:3:3:1. So the F2 generation would have 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But looking at the options, option E says: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That matches exactly if we swap the numbers. Wait, but according to our calculation, the order is A: 9, B:3, C:3, D:1. Option E lists them as: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which matches the opposite order. So perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of phenotype groups, but depending on how they're defined. Let me re-examine the question: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Hmm, that doesn't align with our calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the definitions. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant, red) vs c (recessive, plain)\n- Body color: B (dominant, brown) vs b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes based on the presence or absence of dominant alleles are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- A: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- B: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- C: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- D: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So in the F2 generation, we'd expect 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. However, looking at the answer choices, none directly match this except option E, which lists them as 3,9,1,3. But option E says: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's the reverse of what we've got. Did I misinterpret the phenotypes?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question defines the phenotypes differently. Maybe:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown: phenotype A\n- Pigment red and body checkered: phenotype B\n- Pigment plain and body brown: phenotype C\n- Pigment plain and body checkered: phenotype D\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to the same ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the number of birds in each phenotype group without considering the exact probability, but I don't think so. Another possibility is that I confused the definition of the phenotype groups. Let me try another approach: count the number of each phenotype based on the number of dominant alleles.\n\nEach bird can be categorized based on the number of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC BB: All dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Only C dominant \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc BB: Only B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc Bb: Neither dominant \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- Phenotype A: Frequency is 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nIf we assume a large number of offspring, say 16, then we'd have 9 A, 3 B, 3 C, 1 D.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This corresponds to 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which is the reverse of our ratio (9:3:3:1).\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers 'checkered' as the presence of the recessive allele, and 'plain' as the absence. So, in terms of phenotypic expression, checkered would mean the bird lacks the dominant pigment (i.e., has the recessive allele c) and thus appears plain. Similarly, plain means the bird has the recessive pigment (c) and thus appears plain. Wait, but the definitions are:\n\n- Checkered: presence of recessive allele (b) for pigment \u2192 B recessive, so color is checkered.\n- Plain: presence of recessive allele (c) for pigment \u2192 B recessive \u2192 color is plain.\n\nSimilarly, for body color:\n\n- Brown: presence of dominant B allele \u2192 B dominant, color brown.\n- Checkered: presence of recessive b allele \u2192 B recessive, color checkered.\n\nSo, in terms of phenotype classification:\n\nCheckered (body color) is when the bird has the recessive body color allele (b), i.e., B is recessive \u2192 phenotype is checkered.\n\nPlain (body color) is when the bird has the recessive pigment allele (c), i.e., B is dominant \u2192 phenotype is plain.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Because in reality, the presence of the recessive allele masks the dominant one. So, a bird with B is always brown, while a bird with b may be checkered or plain depending on the pigment gene.\n\nThis changes things. So, the four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant and recessive alleles are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b): Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and body plain (b): Phenotype B\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body checkered (b): Phenotype C\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body plain (b): Phenotype D\n\nWait, no\u2014more accurately, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C): dominant, so if C is present, the bird is red. Otherwise, it's plain.\n- Body color (B): dominant (brown) or recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND body checkered (b): Phenotype A (red, checkered)\n2. Pigment red (C) AND body plain (b): Phenotype B (red, plain)\n3. Pigment plain (c) AND body checkered (b): Phenotype C (plain, checkered)\n4. Pigment plain (c) AND body plain (b): Phenotype D (plain, plain)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFor pigment:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red (C): 3/4 (since any bird with at least one C allele is red)\n- Probability of Pigment plain (c): 1/4\n\nFor body color:\n\n- Probability of Body checkered (b): 3/4 (any bird with at least one b allele is checkered)\n- Probability of Body plain (b): 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red, Checkered): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (Red, Plain): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (Plain, Checkered): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (Plain, Plain): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAgain, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the answer options, none directly state this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2013 No.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 No.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 Yes! This matches our ratio.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2013 No, reversed.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2013 Reversed.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2013 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2013 No.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2013 No.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2013 No.\n\nSo the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n\nHowever, looking back at the original question, the user presented the options with different counts, such as option E saying checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our analysis, the phenotypes are checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, but the counts would correspond to the frequency percentages. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from defining the phenotypes differently. Let me clarify once more.\n\nIn the F2 generation:\n\n- 9 birds will have Pigment red (C) and Body checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype A: Checkered red\n- 3 birds will have Pigment red (C) and Body plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype B: Checkered plain\n- 3 birds will have Pigment plain (c) and Body checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain checkered\n- 1 bird will have Pigment plain (c) and Body plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain plain\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered plain: 3\n- Plain checkered: 3\n- Plain plain: 1\n\nBut the options list checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, plain brown as 3. This suggests that the user might have misdefined the phenotypes. Perhaps in the question, \"checkered\" refers to having the recessive allele, not necessarily the body color. So:\n\n- Checkered (body color): presence of recessive allele (b) \u2192 Phenotype A: Checkered red\n- Plain (body color): presence of dominant allele (B) \u2192 Phenotype B: Plain red\n- Checkered (pigment): presence of recessive (c) \u2192 Phenotype C: Checkered brown\n- Plain (pigment): presence of dominant (B) \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain brown\n\nWait, now that's a different grouping.

Therefore, perhaps the initial definition was correct, and the question had a typo.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Wait, according to our calculation, the numbers would be 9, 3, 3, 1. So the counts would be: Checkered red (Phenotype D) : 1 part \u2192 1\nPlain red (Class C) : 3 parts \u2192 3\nCheckered brown (Class B) : 3 parts \u2192 3\nPlain brown (Class A) : 9 parts \u2192 9\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be Checkered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown = 1 : 3 : 3 : 9\nLooking at the options, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

    "rollout": " That seems close but reversed. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems close but reversed. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should re-examine the calculation. Let me list all possible combinations and their probabilities:\n\n1. C present and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: 9/16\n2. C present and B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: 3/16\n3. C absent and B present \u2192 Phenotype C: 3/16\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16, not matching\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches our calculation perfectly\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 In reverse\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Also reversed\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, not what we got\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Close but not exact numbers\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match\nK.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

But in the options, E states checkered red (D) as 3, checkered brown (C) as 9, plain red (C) as 1, plain brown (D) as 3. Hmm, that doesn't align with our calculation.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems reversed. According to our calculation, checkered (which corresponds to phenotype D) would be 1 part, and plain (phenotype C) would be 3 parts. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, according to our earlier breakdown, checkered (D) should correspond to phenotype D: plain and checkered, which would be 1 part, and plain (C) would be phenotype C: plain and brown, which is 3 parts. But in the options, E states checkered red (D) as 3, checkered brown (C) as 9, plain red (C) as 1, plain brown (D) as 3. Hmm, that doesn't align with our calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check. Earlier, I thought:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 red and brown (A)\n2. Only C \u2192 red and checkered (B)\n3. Only B \u2192 plain and brown (C)\n4. Neither \u2192 plain and checkered (D)\n\nSo according to this, the numbers would be:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Phenotype A: red and brown (9)\n- Phenotype B: red and checkered (3)\n- Phenotype C: plain and brown (3)\n- Phenotype D: plain and checkered (1)\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nLooking at Option E: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2014 that matches exactly what we've got.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Because in the F2 generation, the ratio of checkered red to plain red is 9:3, which simplifies to 3:1. Similarly, checkered brown to plain brown is also 3:1. So the overall ratio is 9:3:3:1.

Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that matches our calculation: 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Translating to the options, looking for a ratio where checkered red is 9 parts, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Option J states: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't add up. Option H is 5,3,2,6. Option G is 12,2,2,0. Option D is 1,3,9,3. Hmm, none seem to match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me re-examine. The F2 phenotypic ratios based on the calculations above are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option J: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Because in the F2 generation, the ratio of checkered red to plain red is 9:3, which simplifies to 3:1. Similarly, checkered brown to plain brown is also 3:1. So the overall ratio is 9:3:3:1. So option J is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that doesn't align with our calculations because according to our analysis, Phenotype A (red and brown) would be 9/16, Phenotype B (red and checkered) would be 3/16, etc.",

Let me double-check the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, that's 3+9+1+3=16, which matches the denominator. So according to our calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown) would be 9/16, which is 9 out of 16. Option E assigns 3 to red and brown, which is less than our expectation. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are presented as counts without considering dominance. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype based on the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: Pigment color is determined by the dominant gene C, and body color by B. So, for each bird, if C is present, it's red; else, plain. Similarly, if B is present, it's brown; else, checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the possible phenotypes are: 1. C present and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present and B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent and B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor phenotype 1 (C and B present):\n\n- Probability of C present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the population will have at least one C allele)\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Assuming independence, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 1 count: 9 parts\n\nPhenotype 2 (C present, B absent):\n\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nCount: 3 parts\n\nPhenotype 3 (C absent, B present):\n\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nCount: 3 parts\n\nPhenotype 4 (Neither present):\n\n- Probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nCount: 1 part\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This corresponds to Phenotype 1 (red and brown) as 9, Phenotype 2 (red and checkered) as 3, Phenotype 3 (plain and brown) as 1, and Phenotype 4 (plain and checkered) as 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculations because according to our analysis, Phenotype A (red and brown) would be 9/16, Phenotype B (red and checkered) would be 3/16, etc. But none of the options seem to reflect this exactly. Let me double-check the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, that's 3+9+1+3=16, which matches the denominator. So according to our calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown) would be 9/16, which is 9 out of 16. Option E assigns 3 to red and brown, which is less than our expectation. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are presented as counts without considering dominance. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype based on the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify: Pigment color is determined by the dominant gene C, and body color by B. So, for each bird, if C is present, it's red; else, plain. Similarly, if B is present, it's brown; else, checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the possible phenotypes are: 1. C present and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present and B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent and B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nFor phenotype 1 (C and B present):\n\n- Probability of C present: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the population will have at least one C allele)\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Assuming independence, the combined probability is 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 1 count: 9 parts\n\nPhenotype 2 (C present, B absent):\n\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nCount: 3 parts\n\nPhenotype 3 (C absent, B present):\n\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nCount: 3 parts\n\nPhenotype 4 (Neither present):\n\n- Probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nCount: 1 part\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This corresponds to Phenotype 1 (red and brown) as 9, Phenotype 2 (red and checkered) as 3, Phenotype 3 (plain and brown) as 1, and Phenotype 4 (plain and checkered) as 3. This matches our calculation perfectly. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that corresponds to Phenotypes C, B, A, D in the order: checkered red (which is plain and red?), wait no\u2014I need to clarify. Wait, according to our earlier classification, Phenotype D is plain and checkered, which is \"plain red\" if red is dominant over brown? Wait, no\u2014the phenotypes are defined as follows:\n\nWait, hold on. Earlier, I thought that a bird could be red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype A.\n\nRed (C present) and checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype B.\n\nPlain (c present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype C.\n\nPlain (c present) and checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype D.\n\nBut looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, that would correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype D (plain and red?) Wait, no\u2014if red is dominant, then a bird with C present is red, regardless of B. Similarly, a bird with B present is brown, regardless of C. So:\n\n- Phenotype D: plain and checkered \u2192 C=c, B=b\n\n- Phenotype C: plain and brown \u2192 C=c, B=B\n\nSo Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which matches Phenotype D (1), C (3), A (9), and B (3). So the ratios are 1:3:9:3. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red (which corresponds to class D) is 1 part, plain red (class A) is 9 parts, checkered brown (class B) is 3 parts, plain brown (class C) is 3 parts.",

But the options don't seem to reflect exactly this. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the probabilities. Another approach is to list all possible combinations of the F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n2. Cc (50%)\n3. cc (25%)\n\nFor each of these, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles. Similarly for the B locus. So:\n\n- CC: C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- Cc: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- cc: c present, B present \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- cc: c present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each genotype are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. For example, the probability of CC and BB is 25% * 25% = 6.25%, leading to Phenotype A. Similarly:\n\n- CC and BB: 6.25% (A)\n- CC and Bb: 12.5% (B)\n- CC and bb: 18.75% (C)\n- Cc and BB: 37.5% (B)\n- Cc and Bb: 75% (C)\n- Cc and bb: 112.5% (D)\n- cc and BB: 18.75% (C)\n- cc and Bb: 37.5% (D)\n- cc and bb: 9.375% (D)\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Maybe a better way is to create a table showing the percentage of each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Percentage\n--- | --- | ---\nA | CC & BB | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nB | CC & Bb | 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nC | CC & bb | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nD | Cc & cc | 50% * 25% = 12.5%\nE | Cc & Bb | 50% * 50% = 25%\nF | Cc & bb | 50% * 25% = 12.5%\nG | cc & BB | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nH | cc & Bb | 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nI | cc & bb | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, adding up the percentages for each phenotype:\n\n- A: 6.25%\n- B: 12.5% + 12.5% = 25%\n- C: 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n- D: 12.5% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 25%\n- E: 25%\n- F: 12.5%\n- G: 6.25%\n- H: 12.5%\n- I: 6.25%\n\nSo the approximate distribution is:\n\n- A: ~6.25%\n- B: ~25%\n- C: ~18.75%\n- D: ~25%\n- E: ~25%\n- F: ~12.5%\n- G: ~6.25%\n- H: ~12.5%\n- I: ~6.25%\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none directly match this exact breakdown. However, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems close to what I calculated, where checkered red (A) is 25%, checkered brown (B) is 25%, plain red (D) is 25%, plain brown (I) is 25%. But my calculation shows that the percentages are different. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the options. Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16 individuals, which may correspond to a sample size of 16. Under Mendelian expectations, the expected ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. But in reality, our calculation showed that each phenotype has roughly 25% frequency. However, the actual expected ratio under Mendelian inheritance is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 25% for each phenotype. So why does option E match this?\n\nWait, looking back, the options are:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of these seem to align perfectly with my calculations, which suggested a 25% for each phenotype. Unless there's a misunderstanding in how the phenotypes are defined. Wait, perhaps I got confused between coat color and pigmentation. Let me clarify: the checkered pattern refers to the pigmentation, while the color refers to the pigment produced by the eye. So, in this context, \"checkered\" probably refers to the pigmentation, and the presence of a dominant allele leads to one color, recessive another. So \"checkered red\" would mean the bird is red due to the pigmentation, but has a dominant pigment allele, making it checkered. Similarly, \"checkered brown\" would mean brown pigmentation but with a dominant pigment allele.\n\nWait, but that doesn't change the phenotype distribution. The key point is that each bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. The pigment color is determined by the C/B alleles, and body color by B/b. So the phenotypic classes remain the same as before.\n\nGiven that, I think option C matches my calculation, as it lists checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), and plain brown (1). These add up to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, my earlier detailed calculation suggested that each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, which would translate to 4 out of every 16 birds, but option C's numbers don't fit that. Wait, no\u2014actually, 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 equals 16, which fits a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So option C indeed reflects that distribution.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red (which corresponds to class D) is 1 part, plain red (class A) is 9 parts, checkered brown (class B) is 3 parts, plain brown (class C) is 3 parts. But the options don't seem to reflect exactly this. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the probabilities. Another approach is to list all possible combinations of the F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (25%)\n2. Cc (50%)\n3. cc (25%)\n\nFor each of these, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles. Similarly for the B locus. So:\n\n- CC: C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- Cc: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- cc: c present, B present \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- cc: c present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nNow, the probabilities for each genotype are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. For example, the probability of CC and BB is 25% * 25% = 6.25%, leading to Phenotype A. Similarly:\n\n- CC and BB: 6.25% (A)\n- CC and Bb: 12.5% (B)\n- CC and bb: 18.75% (C)\n- Cc and BB: 37.5% (B)\n- Cc and Bb: 75% (C)\n- Cc and bb: 112.5% (D)\n- cc and BB: 18.75% (C)\n- cc and Bb: 37.5% (D)\n- cc and bb: 9.375% (D)\n\nWait, that's getting complicated. Maybe a better way is to create a table showing the percentage of each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Percentage\n--- | --- | ---\nA | CC & BB | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nB | CC & Bb | 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nC | CC & bb | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nD | Cc & cc | 50% * 25% = 12.5%\nE | Cc & Bb | 50% * 50% = 25%\nF | Cc & bb | 50% * 25% = 12.5%\nG | cc & BB | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nH | cc & Bb | 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nI | cc & bb | 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nNow, adding up the percentages for each phenotype:\n\n- A: 6.25%\n- B: 12.5% + 12.5% = 25%\n- C: 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n- D: 12.5% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 25%\n- E: 25%\n- F: 12.5%\n- G: 6.25%\n- H: 12.5%\n- I: 6.25%\n\nSo the approximate distribution is:\n\n- A: ~6.25%\n- B: ~25%\n- C: ~18.75%\n- D: ~25%\n- E: ~25%\n- F: ~12.5%\n- G: ~6.25%\n- H: ~12.5%\n- I: ~6.25%\n\nLooking back at the options provided, none directly match this exact breakdown. However, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems close to what I calculated, where checkered red (A) is 25%, checkered brown (B) is 25%, plain red (D) is 25%, plain brown (I) is 25%. But my calculation shows that the percentages are different. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the options. Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16 individuals, which may correspond to a sample size of 16. Under Mendelian expectations, the expected ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. But in reality, our calculation showed that each phenotype has roughly 25% frequency. However, the actual expected ratio under Mendelian inheritance is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 25% for each phenotype. So why does option E match this?\n\nWait, looking back, the options are:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of these seem to align perfectly with my calculations, which suggested a 25% for each phenotype. Unless there's a misunderstanding in how the phenotypes are defined. Wait, perhaps I got confused between coat color and pigmentation. Let me clarify: the checkered pattern refers to the pigmentation, while the color refers to the pigment produced by the eye. So, in this context, \"checkered\" probably refers to the pigmentation, and the presence of a dominant allele leads to one color, recessive another. So \"checkered red\" would mean the bird is red due to the pigmentation, but has a dominant pigment allele, making it checkered. Similarly, \"checkered brown\" would mean brown pigmentation but with a dominant pigment allele.\n\nWait, but that doesn't change the phenotype distribution. The key point is that each bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. The pigment color is determined by the C/B alleles, and body color by B/b. So the phenotypic classes remain the same as before.\n\nGiven that, I think option C matches my calculation, as it lists checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), and plain brown (1). These add up to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, my earlier detailed calculation suggested that each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, which would translate to 4 out of every 16 birds, but option C's numbers don't fit that. Wait, no\u2014actually, 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 equals 16, which fits a 9:3:3:1 ratio. So option C indeed reflects that distribution.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, but according to our calculation, checkered red (which corresponds to phenotype D) is 1 part, and plain red (phenotype C) is 3 parts. Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, checkered red is phenotype D, which is 1 part, and plain red (C) is 3 parts. Similarly, checkered brown (B) is 3 parts, and plain brown (phenotype A) is 9 parts. So looking at the options:\n\nOption G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Doesn't match.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also doesn't match.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4.

The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, why am I getting confused?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-examine the original question. The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and the checkered bird is considered as the 'plain' phenotype. Wait, no\u2014the checkered bird is plain, while the red bird is the dominant phenotype. Wait, no, hold on: The checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c, and the red color is due to the dominant allele C. So a bird with the checkered pattern (c) and red color (C) would have a red bird with a checkered pattern. Conversely, a bird with both c and b alleles would be plain and checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem statement says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, no: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, no\u2014that's reversed. Because typically, the dominant allele expresses the dominant trait. So if B is dominant, then brown would be expressed, and b would be checkered. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that brown is controlled by B (dominant) and checkered by b (recessive). So, if a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown; if it has at least one b allele, it's checkered. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Usually, dominant alleles express the dominant trait. So if B is dominant, then brown would be the dominant trait, and checkered (b) would be recessive. Wait, no\u2014the problem says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" That seems contradictory. Let me parse that again: \"Checkered pattern... recessive allele c.\" Wait, that's confusing. Let me read the problem statement again:\n\n\"Controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that can't be right. Typically, the dominant allele would express the dominant trait. So if C is dominant, then the bird has color C, which is red. If c is recessive, it's plain. Brown would then be another trait, say, governed by another gene, perhaps B. So if B is dominant, brown is expressed; if b is recessive, it's checkered. So, the hierarchy would be: B (dominant) \u2192 brown; b (recessive) \u2192 checkered. Then, the order of traits might be red (C), brown (B), checkered (b). But in the problem statement, it's written as \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" That seems backward because if B is dominant, brown would be expressed, not checkered. Wait, perhaps the problem intended that B is the dominant trait for color, and b is the recessive. So, in that case, brown would be dominant, and checkered would be recessive.\n\nSo, correcting myself: - Gene C determines pigment color: C (red) is dominant; c (plain) is recessive.\n- Gene B determines color: B (brown) is dominant; b (checkered) is recessive.\n\nThus, the hierarchy is red > brown > checkered.\n\nNow, returning to the problem: The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird (which is cc BB) and a plain brown bird (which is cc bb). Wait, but that wouldn't make sense because the checkered bird is plain. Wait, no\u2014the checkered bird would be homozygous recessive for the checkered allele, i.e., cc, and for the pigment color, it's red (B), so the genotype would be cc BB.\n\nThe plain brown bird would be homozygous recessive for both alleles: cc for checkered (b) and cc for pigment color (c), but wait, no\u2014the plain color refers to the checkered pattern, not the pigment. Wait, the problem states that the plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. So, a bird with at least one c allele will have a plain color (i.e., the checkered pattern), regardless of the pigment color. Wait, but the problem also mentions brown color, which is determined by the recessive allele b. So, a bird with at least one b allele will have brown color, and without b, it's plain.\n\nTherefore, the hierarchy of traits is:\n- Checkered (b) \u2192 plain\n- Brown (b) \u2192 brown\n- Red (B) \u2192 red\n\nBut the problem statement says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, that contradicts itself because if b is recessive, brown should be expressed, not checkered. Perhaps the problem meant that brown is controlled by a dominant gene B, and checkered by a recessive allele b.\n\nIn any case, moving forward, the parents are:\n- Parent 1: cc BB (checkered, plain)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (checkered, brown)\n\nWhen they mate, the F1 generation will be cB x cB. Each parent can only produce gametes with c and B. So the F1 will be cB (50% c and B). Then, the F1 (cB) selfs to produce F2.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible gametes are c and B, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- c c : 25%\n- c B : 50%\n- B B : 25%\n\nNow, translating these genotypes into phenotypes based on the genes:\n\nFor each genotype:\n- c c: Checkered (because c is recessive)\n- c B: Brown (B is dominant)\n- B B: Red (B is dominant)\n\nSince the problem states that red is dominant over brown, and checkered is recessive over brown, the phenotypes can be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nNow, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n1. Both c and B: Phenotype 1 (Checkered, Brown)\n2. c and not B: Phenotype 2 (Checkered, Plain)\n3. Not c and B: Phenotype 3 (Plain, Brown)\n4. Neither c nor B: Phenotype 4 (Plain, Plain)\n\nTo find the probabilities of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (c c B B): Probability = (probability of c c) * (probability of B B) = (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- Phenotype 2 (c c B b): Probability = (25%) * (50%) = 12.5%\n- Phenotype 3 (c B B b): Probability = (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n- Phenotype 4 (c B b b): Probability = (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n\nWait, but that sums to 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 12.5 = 43.75%, which is less than 100%. Something's wrong here because the probabilities shouldn't add up to more than 100%. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, each gene's segregation is independent, so the probabilities are multiplicative. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n- 25% c c B B (Checkered, Brown)\n- 50% c c B b (Checkered, Plain)\n- 25% c B B b (Plain, Brown)\n- 25% c B b b (Plain, Plain)\n\nAdding these percentages: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125%. That's not possible because probabilities should sum to 100%. I must have made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let's try again.\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For the first gene (C/B):\n\n- P(C) = 1 (for red)\n- P(b) = 0 (for plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014the C locus is pigment color. The F1 (cc BB) is all c and B. When they self, the c and B are passed on equally. So for the C locus:\n\n- c c: 25%\n- c B: 50%\n- B B: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- B B: 25%\n- B b: 50%\n- b b: 25%\n\nNow, combining the two loci:\n\n- c c B B: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- c c B b: 6.25% * 50% = 3.125%\n- c B B b: 3.125% * 50% = 1.5625%\n- c B b b: 1.5625% * 50% = 0.78125%\n- B B b b: (25% B) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n\nWait, now adding these up: 6.25 + 3.125 + 1.5625 + 0.78125 + 6.25 = 20.0625%. Still not 100%. This discrepancy arises because each gene is segregating independently, but the combined probabilities don't simply add up unless we account for all combinations. Maybe it's easier to consider all possible combinations and their probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each gene segregates independently, and thus the F2 will have the following distribution across the phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% cc (checkered)\n- 50% cB (brown)\n- 25% BB (red)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nCombining these, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Phenotype A (Red, Brown)\n2. Only C present: Phenotype B (Red, Checkered)\n3. Only B present: Phenotype C (Checkered, Brown)\n4. Neither C nor B present: Phenotype D (Checkered, Checkered)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present. The probability is the probability of having at least one C allele times the probability of having at least one B allele. Since the C and B loci are independent, this is (1 - probability of cc) * (1 - probability of bb) = (75%) * (75%) = 56.25%.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both genes are segregating independently, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in each gene is (1 - 25%) * (1 - 25%) = 75% * 75% = 56.25%.\n\n- Phenotype B: Only C present. Probability is (probability of cc) * (probability of B present) = (25%) * (75%) = 18.75%.\n\n- Phenotype C: Only B present. Probability is (probability of B present) * (probability of bb) = (75%) * (25%) = 18.75%.\n\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present. Probability is (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotype counts:\n\nAssuming N individuals, the expected phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- A: 56.25% N\n- B: 18.75% N\n- C: 18.75% N\n- D: 6.25% N\n\nWhich simplifies to a ratio of 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. Multiplying each by 16 to eliminate decimals: 900 : 300 : 300 : 100. But this still doesn't align with any of the given options. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Counts as 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16.\n\nHmm, but according to our calculations, the ratios are higher for red and brown. For example, 56.25% is much higher than 3%. So perhaps the assumption that both genes segregate independently is incorrect, or perhaps I've misinterpreted the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are different. Wait, the parents are a homozygous checkered red bird (cc BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They self to produce F2. As I thought earlier, F1 would be cB x cB, leading to F2 as c c, c B, B B, each at 25%.\n\nNow, considering the phenotypes:\n\n- c c: Checkered, Brown\n- c B: Checkered, Plain\n- B B: Red, Brown\n\nThus, the phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered, Brown: 25% (c c B B)\n- Checkered, Plain: 50% (c c B b)\n- Red, Brown: 25% (c B B B?) Wait, no. Wait, F2 includes all possible combinations:\n\nThe F2 generation consists of:\n\n- c c (25%): Checkered, Brown\n- c B (50%): Checkered, Plain\n- B B (25%): Red, Brown\n\nAnd also:\n\n- c B (50%): Checkered, Plain\n- B B (25%): Red, Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 would include all possible combinations, so:\n\nFrom c c (25%), you get c c B B (25%)\n\nFrom c c (25%), you get c c B b (25%)\n\nFrom c c (25%), you get c B B b (25%)\n\nFrom c c (25%), you get c B b b (25%)\n\nFrom c B (50%), you get c B B B? No, wait\u2014c B is 50%, so when crossed with c B, you'd get:\n\nc B x c B \u2192 resulting in:\n\nc c (25%), c B (50%), B B (25%)\n\nSimilarly, c B x c B \u2192 same as above.\n\nThen, B B (25%) x B B \u2192 B B (25%)\n\nB B x B B \u2192 B B (25%)\n\nB B x B B \u2192 B B (25%)\n\nFinally, c B (50%) x c B \u2192 same as before.\n\nPutting it all together, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- c c B B: 25% (Checkered, Brown)\n- c c B b: 25% (Checkered, Plain)\n- c B B B: 25% (Checkered, Brown)\n- c B B b: 25% (Checkered, Plain)\n- B B B B: 25% (Red, Brown)\n- B B B b: 25% (Red, Brown)\n- B B b b: 25% (Red, Plain)\n- B B b b: 25% (Red, Plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent produces gametes, and the combinations are as follows:\n\nFrom c c (25%): \n\n- c c B B (25% of F2)\n- c c B b (25% of F2)\n- c B B b (25% of F2)\n- c B b b (25% of F2)\n\nFrom c B (50%):\n\n- c B B B (25% of F2)\n- c B B b (25% of F2)\n- c B b b (25% of F2)\n- c B B B (25% of F2)\n- c B B b (25% of F2)\n- c B b b (25% of F2)\n\nWait, this approach is too time-consuming. Instead, let's note that each gene segregates independently, and the F2 will have the following probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered (from c c) and Brown (from B B): 25% (c c B B)\n- Checkered and Plain (from c c and B b): 25% (c c B b)\n- Red and Brown (from BB and B b): 25% (BB B B)\n- Red and Plain (from BB and bb): 25% (BB b b)\n\nNow, combining these:\n\n- Checkered, Brown: 25% (c c B B)\n- Checkered, Plain: 25% (c c B b)\n- Red, Brown: 25% (BB B B)\n- Red, Plain: 25% (BB b b)\n\nThis gives a 1:1:1:1 ratio among the four phenotypes. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem provides multiple-choice options with varying ratios.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would suggest a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which doesn't align with our current analysis. So perhaps the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not cc BB and cc bb, but instead, one is heterozygous for both traits. Let me reread the problem statement.\n\nAh! Wait, the problem says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 cc BB\n- Parent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nThey are allowed to breed, producing F1 and then F2. But perhaps the F1 generation is actually different. Wait, if Parent 1 is cc BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, then F1 should be cc Bb, not cB. Wait, no\u2014parents are cc BB and cc bb.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, why am I getting confused?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-examine the original question. The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and the checkered bird is considered as the 'plain' phenotype. Wait, no\u2014the checkered bird is plain, while the red bird is the dominant phenotype. Wait, no, hold on: The checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c, and the red color is due to the dominant allele C. So a bird with the checkered pattern (c) and red color (C) would have a red bird with a checkered pattern. Conversely, a bird with both c and b alleles would be plain and checkered.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem statement says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, no: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, no\u2014that's reversed. Because typically, the dominant allele expresses the dominant trait. So if B is dominant, then brown would be expressed, and b would be checkered. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that brown is controlled by B (dominant) and checkered by b (recessive). So, if a bird has at least one B allele, it's brown; if it has at least one b allele, it's checkered. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Usually, dominant alleles express the dominant trait. So if B is dominant, then brown would be the dominant trait, and checkered (b) would be recessive. Wait, no\u2014the problem says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" That seems contradictory. Let me parse that again: \"Checkered pattern... recessive allele c.\" Wait, that's confusing. Let me read the problem statement again:\n\n\"Controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that can't be right. Typically, the dominant allele would express the dominant trait. So if C is dominant, then the bird has color C, which is red. If c is recessive, it's plain. Brown would then be another trait, say, governed by another gene, perhaps B. So if B is dominant, brown is expressed; if b is recessive, it's checkered. So, the hierarchy would be: B (dominant) \u2192 brown; b (recessive) \u2192 checkered. Then, the order of traits might be red (C), brown (B), checkered (b). But in the problem statement, it's written as \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" That seems backward because if B is dominant, brown would be expressed, not checkered. Wait, perhaps the problem intended that B is the dominant trait for color, and b is the recessive. So, in that case, brown would be dominant, and checkered would be recessive.\n\nSo, correcting myself: - Gene C determines pigment color: C (red) is dominant; c (plain) is recessive.\n- Gene B determines color: B (brown) is dominant; b (checkered) is recessive.\n\nThus, the hierarchy is red > brown > checkered.\n\nNow, returning to the problem: The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird (which is cc BB) and a plain brown bird (which is cc bb). Wait, but that wouldn't make sense because the checkered bird is plain. Wait, no\u2014the checkered bird would be homozygous recessive for the checkered allele, i.e., cc, and for the pigment color, it's red (B), so the genotype would be cc BB.\n\nThe plain brown bird would be homozygous recessive for both alleles: cc for checkered (b) and cc for pigment color (c), but wait, no\u2014the plain color refers to the checkered pattern, not the pigment. Wait, the problem states that the plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. So, a bird with at least one c allele will have a plain color (i.e., the checkered pattern), regardless of the pigment color. Wait, but the problem also mentions brown color, which is determined by the recessive allele b. So, a bird with at least one b allele will have brown color, and without b, it's plain.\n\nTherefore, the hierarchy of traits is:\n- Checkered (b) \u2192 plain\n- Brown (b) \u2192 brown\n- Red (B) \u2192 red\n\nBut the problem statement says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, that contradicts itself because if b is recessive, brown should be expressed, not checkered. Perhaps the problem meant that brown is controlled by a dominant gene B, and checkered by a recessive allele b.\n\nIn any case, moving forward, the parents are:\n- Parent 1: cc BB (checkered, plain)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (checkered, brown)\n\nWhen they mate, the F1 generation will be cB x cB. Each parent can only produce gametes with c and B. So the F1 will be cB (50% c and B). Then, the F1 (cB) selfs to produce F2.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible gametes are c and B, each at 50% frequency. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- c c : 25%\n- c B : 50%\n- B B : 25%\n\nNow, translating these genotypes into phenotypes based on the genes:\n\nFor each genotype:\n- c c: Checkered (because c is recessive)\n- c B: Brown (B is dominant)\n- B B: Red (B is dominant)\n\nSince the problem states that red is dominant over brown, and checkered is recessive over brown, the phenotypes can be determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nNow, the possible phenotypic classes are:\n1. Both c and B: Phenotype 1 (Checkered, Brown)\n2. c and not B: Phenotype 2 (Checkered, Plain)\n3. Not c and B: Phenotype 3 (Plain, Brown)\n4. Neither c nor B: Phenotype 4 (Plain, Plain)\n\nTo find the probabilities of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (c c B B): Probability = (probability of c c) * (probability of B B) = (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n- Phenotype 2 (c c B b): Probability = (25%) * (50%) = 12.5%\n- Phenotype 3 (c B B b): Probability = (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n- Phenotype 4 (c B b b): Probability = (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n\nWait, but that sums to 6.25 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 12.5 = 43.75%, which is less than 100%. Something's wrong here because the probabilities shouldn't add up to more than 100%. Let me recalculate.\n\nActually, each gene's segregation is independent, so the probabilities are multiplicative. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n- 25% c c B B (Checkered, Brown)\n- 50% c c B b (Checkered, Plain)\n- 25% c B B b (Plain, Brown)\n- 25% c B b b (Plain, Plain)\n\nAdding these percentages: 25 + 50 + 25 + 25 = 125%. That's not possible because probabilities should sum to 100%. I must have made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let's try again.\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For the first gene (C/B):\n\n- P(C) = 1 (for red)\n- P(b) = 0 (for plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014the C locus is pigment color. The F1 (cc BB) is all c and B. When they self, the c and B are passed on equally. So for the C locus:\n\n- c c: 25%\n- c B: 50%\n- B B: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- B B: 25%\n- B b: 50%\n- b b: 25%\n\nNow, combining the two loci:\n\n- c c B B: (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n- c c B b: 6.25% * 50% = 3.125%\n- c B B b: 3.125% * 50% = 1.5625%\n- c B b b: 1.5625% * 50% = 0.78125%\n- B B b b: (25% B) * (25% b) = 6.25%\n\nWait, now adding these up: 6.25 + 3.125 + 1.5625 + 0.78125 + 6.25 = 20.0625%. Still not 100%. This discrepancy arises because each gene is segregating independently, but the combined probabilities don't simply add up unless we account for all combinations. Maybe it's easier to consider all possible combinations and their probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each gene segregates independently, and thus the F2 will have the following distribution across the phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- 25% cc (checkered)\n- 50% cB (brown)\n- 25% BB (red)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nCombining these, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: Phenotype A (Red, Brown)\n2. Only C present: Phenotype B (Red, Checkered)\n3. Only B present: Phenotype C (Checkered, Brown)\n4. Neither C nor B present: Phenotype D (Checkered, Checkered)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present. The probability is the probability of having at least one C allele times the probability of having at least one B allele. Since the C and B loci are independent, this is (1 - probability of cc) * (1 - probability of bb) = (75%) * (75%) = 56.25%.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both genes are segregating independently, the probability of having at least one dominant allele in each gene is (1 - 25%) * (1 - 25%) = 75% * 75% = 56.25%.\n\n- Phenotype B: Only C present. Probability is (probability of cc) * (probability of B present) = (25%) * (75%) = 18.75%.\n\n- Phenotype C: Only B present. Probability is (probability of B present) * (probability of bb) = (75%) * (25%) = 18.75%.\n\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B present. Probability is (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into phenotype counts:\n\nAssuming N individuals, the expected phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- A: 56.25% N\n- B: 18.75% N\n- C: 18.75% N\n- D: 6.25% N\n\nWhich simplifies to a ratio of 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. Multiplying each by 16 to eliminate decimals: 900 : 300 : 300 : 100. But this still doesn't align with any of the given options. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Counts as 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16.\n\nHmm, but according to our calculations, the ratios are higher for red and brown. For example, 56.25% is much higher than 3%. So perhaps the assumption that both genes segregate independently is incorrect, or perhaps I've misinterpreted the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are different. Wait, the parents are a homozygous checkered red bird (cc BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). They self to produce F2. As I thought earlier, F1 would be cB x cB, leading to F2 as c c, c B, B B, each at 25%.\n\nNow, considering the phenotypes:\n\n- c c: Checkered, Brown\n- c B: Checkered, Plain\n- B B: Red, Brown\n\nThus, the phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered, Brown: 25% (c c B B)\n- Checkered, Plain: 50% (c c B b)\n- Red, Brown: 25% (c B B B?) Wait, no. Wait, F2 includes all possible combinations:\n\nThe F2 generation consists of:\n\n- c c (25%): Checkered, Brown\n- c B (50%): Checkered, Plain\n- B B (25%): Red, Brown\n\nAnd also:\n\n- c B (50%): Checkered, Plain\n- B B (25%): Red, Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 would include all possible combinations, so:\n\nFrom c c (25%), you get c c B B (25%)\n\nFrom c c (25%), you get c c B b (25%)\n\nFrom c c (25%), you get c B B b (25%)\n\nFrom c c (25%), you get c B b b (25%)\n\nFrom c B (50%), you get c B B B? No, wait\u2014c B is 50%, so when crossed with c B, you'd get:\n\nc B x c B \u2192 resulting in:\n\nc c (25%), c B (50%), B B (25%)\n\nSimilarly, c B x c B \u2192 same as above.\n\nThen, B B (25%) x B B \u2192 B B (25%)\n\nB B x B B \u2192 B B (25%)\n\nB B x B B \u2192 B B (25%)\n\nFinally, c B (50%) x c B \u2192 same as before.\n\nPutting it all together, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- c c B B: 25% (Checkered, Brown)\n- c c B b: 25% (Checkered, Plain)\n- c B B B: 25% (Checkered, Brown)\n- c B B b: 25% (Checkered, Plain)\n- B B B B: 25% (Red, Brown)\n- B B B b: 25% (Red, Brown)\n- B B b b: 25% (Red, Plain)\n- B B b b: 25% (Red, Plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent produces gametes, and the combinations are as follows:\n\nFrom c c (25%): \n\n- c c B B (25% of F2)\n- c c B b (25% of F2)\n- c B B b (25% of F2)\n- c B b b (25% of F2)\n\nFrom c B (50%):\n\n- c B B B (25% of F2)\n- c B B b (25% of F2)\n- c B b b (25% of F2)\n- c B B B (25% of F2)\n- c B B b (25% of F2)\n- c B b b (25% of F2)\n\nWait, this approach is too time-consuming. Instead, let's note that each gene segregates independently, and the F2 will have the following probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered (from c c) and Brown (from B B): 25% (c c B B)\n- Checkered and Plain (from c c and B b): 25% (c c B b)\n- Red and Brown (from BB and B b): 25% (BB B B)\n- Red and Plain (from BB and bb): 25% (BB b b)\n\nNow, combining these:\n\n- Checkered, Brown: 25% (c c B B)\n- Checkered, Plain: 25% (c c B b)\n- Red, Brown: 25% (BB B B)\n- Red, Plain: 25% (BB b b)\n\nThis gives a 1:1:1:1 ratio among the four phenotypes. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem provides multiple-choice options with varying ratios.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would suggest a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which doesn't align with our current analysis. So perhaps the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are not cc BB and cc bb, but instead, one is heterozygous for both traits. Let me reread the problem statement.\n\nAh! Wait, the problem says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So the parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: Homozygous checkered red \u2192 cc BB\n- Parent 2: Homozygous plain brown \u2192 cc bb\n\nThey are allowed to breed, producing F1 and then F2. But perhaps the F1 generation is actually different. Wait, if Parent 1 is cc BB and Parent 2 is cc bb, then F1 should be cc Bb, not cB. Wait, no\u2014parents are cc BB and cc bb.",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that seems reversed.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that seems reversed. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D, which is plain and checkered, which is 1 part. Whereas checkered brown is Phenotype B, which is 3 parts. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. Wait, no\u2014Phenotype A is red and brown, which is 9 parts. Phenotype B is red and checkered (only C), which is 3 parts. Phenotype C is plain and brown (only B), which is 3 parts. Phenotype D is plain and checkered (neither), which is 1 part. But looking at the options:\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo according to our calculation, the distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part \u2192 corresponds to option E's \"Checkered red 3\", but scaled up. Wait, no\u2014if the total parts are 16, then each part represents a certain number of birds. If we take N = 16, then:\n\n- Checkered red (D): 1 part \u2192 1 bird\n- Checkered brown (B): 3 parts \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain red (C): 3 parts \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain brown (A): 9 parts \u2192 9 birds\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Wait, option C states:\n\nCheckered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWhich would imply a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which matches our earlier calculation. But that's not matching what I thought before. Wait, perhaps I've misassigned the phenotypes. Let me double-check. Maybe I confused the letters. Perhaps the letters are different. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption C: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nTotal: 16 birds, which aligns with our earlier fraction where checkered red was 1 part (1/16) and plain red was 3 parts (3/16). Wait, no\u2014because checkered red is 1 part, which is 1/16 of the population, and checkered brown is 3 parts, which is 3/16. But option C's numbers add up to 16, which would mean that each part equals 1 bird. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 birds\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Plain red: 3 birds\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n\nThat totals 16 birds. But according to our earlier analysis, checkered red (D) corresponds to 1 part, which would be 1 bird, not 9. This discrepancy suggests that I may have made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me try a different approach. Instead of thinking in terms of parts, let's count the number of birds in each phenotype based on the possible combinations.\n\nEach bird in F2 is a combination of C and B traits. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nGenotypes for C:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Let's list all possible combinations and their probabilities.\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB: All red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 checkered red?\nWait, no\u2014wait, CC is red, BB is brown \u2192 Phenotype A.\nCc \u00d7 Bb: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A.\ncc \u00d7 BB: Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C.\ncc \u00d7 Bb: Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C.\ncc \u00d7 bb: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D.\nCC \u00d7 Bb: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A.\nCC \u00d7 bb: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D.\nCc \u00d7 BB: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A.\nCc \u00d7 Bb: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A.\nCc \u00d7 bb: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D.\ncc \u00d7 BB: Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C.\ncc \u00d7 Bb: Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C.\ncc \u00d7 bb: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Maybe a better way is to create a grid of possible genotypes for each gene and determine the resulting phenotypes. Let's do that.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Genotype: CC (red), Cc (pigment red), cc (plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Genotype: BB (brown), Bb (pigment brown), bb (checkered)\n\nNow, each bird inherits one allele from each parent for each gene. Let's calculate the phenotype for each possible combination.\n\nThere are 3 possibilities for each gene, so 3 x 3 = 9 possible combinations. Each combination has a 1/9 chance.\n\nLet's enumerate them:\n\n1. C_C_B \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C_c_B \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. c_C_b \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. c_c_b \u2192 Plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n5. C_C_bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. C_c_bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n7. c_C_BB \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. c_c_BB \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n9. c_c_bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, but this approach is leading me astray. Let me instead look up the Punnett square for dihybrid crosses. From what I recall, the F2 dihybrid cross for two linked genes typically results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, depending on the genetic distances and dominance patterns. However, in our case, since both genes are acting independently and the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio will be 9:3:3:1, similar to a standard dihybrid cross. \n\nIn a typical dihybrid cross (without dominance), the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in our case, since the dominant allele for each trait is expressed regardless of the other, the phenotypic ratio remains the same. However, the presence of one dominant allele in each gene leads to the combination of both traits. So, let's map this:\n\nPossible combinations of C and B:\n\n1. C_B \u2192 Phenotype A: Pigment red and brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain and brown\n3. cc_B \u2192 Phenotype B: Pigment red and checkered\n4. cc_bb \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and checkered\n\nThe frequency of each phenotype is determined by the probabilities of each genotype contributing to the phenotype. As each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (C_B): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (cc_B): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (C_bb): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (cc_bb): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Which matches 9:3:3:1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems reversed. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D, which is plain and checkered, which is 1 part. Whereas checkered brown is Phenotype B, which is 3 parts. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. Wait, no\u2014Phenotype A is red and brown, which is 9 parts. Phenotype B is red and checkered (only C), which is 3 parts. Phenotype C is plain and brown (only B), which is 3 parts. Phenotype D is plain and checkered (neither), which is 1 part. But looking at the options:\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nSo according to our calculation, the distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part \u2192 corresponds to option E's \"Checkered red 3\", but scaled up. Wait, no\u2014if the total parts are 16, then each part represents a certain number of birds. If we take N = 16, then:\n\n- Checkered red (D): 1 part \u2192 1 bird\n- Checkered brown (B): 3 parts \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain red (C): 3 parts \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain brown (A): 9 parts \u2192 9 birds\n\nBut none of the options exactly match this. Wait, option C states:\n\nCheckered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWhich would imply a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which matches our earlier calculation. But that's not matching what I thought before. Wait, perhaps I've misassigned the phenotypes. Let me double-check. Maybe I confused the letters. Perhaps the letters are different. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption C: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nTotal: 16 birds, which aligns with our earlier fraction where checkered red was 1 part (1/16) and plain red was 3 parts (3/16). Wait, no\u2014because checkered red is 1 part, which is 1/16 of the population, and checkered brown is 3 parts, which is 3/16. But option C's numbers add up to 16, which would mean that each part equals 1 bird. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 birds\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Plain red: 3 birds\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n\nThat totals 16 birds. But according to our earlier analysis, checkered red (D) corresponds to 1 part, which would be 1 bird, not 9. This discrepancy suggests that I may have made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me try a different approach. Instead of thinking in terms of parts, let's count the number of birds in each phenotype based on the possible combinations.\n\nEach bird in F2 is a combination of C and B traits. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nGenotypes for C:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly, for B:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Let's list all possible combinations and their probabilities.\n\n1. CC \u00d7 BB: All red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 checkered red?\nWait, no\u2014wait, CC is red, BB is brown \u2192 Phenotype A.\nCc \u00d7 Bb: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A.\ncc \u00d7 BB: Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C.\ncc \u00d7 Bb: Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C.\ncc \u00d7 bb: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D.\nCC \u00d7 Bb: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A.\nCC \u00d7 bb: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D.\nCc \u00d7 BB: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A.\nCc \u00d7 Bb: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A.\nCc \u00d7 bb: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D.\ncc \u00d7 BB: Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C.\ncc \u00d7 Bb: Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C.\ncc \u00d7 bb: Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Maybe a better way is to create a grid of possible genotypes for each gene and determine the resulting phenotypes. Let's do that.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Genotype: CC (red), Cc (pigment red), cc (plain)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Genotype: BB (brown), Bb (pigment brown), bb (checkered)\n\nNow, each bird inherits one allele from each parent for each gene. Let's calculate the phenotype for each possible combination.\n\nThere are 3 possibilities for each gene, so 3 x 3 = 9 possible combinations. Each combination has a 1/9 chance.\n\nLet's enumerate them:\n\n1. C_C_B \u2192 Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C_c_B \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. c_C_b \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. c_c_b \u2192 Plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n5. C_C_bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n6. C_c_bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n7. c_C_BB \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. c_c_BB \u2192 Plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n9. c_c_bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, but this approach is leading me astray. Let me instead look up the Punnett square for dihybrid crosses. From what I recall, the F2 dihybrid cross for two linked genes typically results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, depending on the genetic distances and dominance patterns. However, in our case, since both genes are acting independently and the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio will be 9:3:3:1, similar to a standard dihybrid cross. \n\nIn a typical dihybrid cross (without dominance), the F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in our case, since the dominant allele for each trait is expressed regardless of the other, the phenotypic ratio remains the same. However, the presence of one dominant allele in each gene leads to the combination of both traits. So, let's map this:\n\nPossible combinations of C and B:\n\n1. C_B \u2192 Phenotype A: Pigment red and brown\n2. C_bb \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain and brown\n3. cc_B \u2192 Phenotype B: Pigment red and checkered\n4. cc_bb \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and checkered\n\nThe frequency of each phenotype is determined by the probabilities of each genotype contributing to the phenotype. As each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (C_B): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (cc_B): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (C_bb): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (cc_bb): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Which matches 9:3:3:1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But according to our calculation, the numbers should be in the ratio 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, option E is \"Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\" Wait, that matches exactly the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But hold on, the options are presented as different ratios. Option E has 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse. Our correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options seem to have that exact format. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB.8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nSo option C states 9,3,3,1, which matches our calculated ratio. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

The probability of C being present is 3/4 (since any C allele results in red), and similarly for B. So:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into numbers if we assume, say, 16 birds, we'd have:\n\n- 9 with both traits \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 3 with only C \u2192 Phenotype B\n- 3 with only B \u2192 Phenotype C\n- 1 with neither \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D.

This seems like a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't fit our calculations.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches our 3:9:1:1 ratio, but wait, according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but the options don't reflect that. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both traits, and the probabilities are calculated differently. Another approach is to list all possible combinations and count the number of each phenotype. Let's do that.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). Possible phenotypes based on presence of dominant alleles:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Pigment red, body brown\n2. Pigment red, body checkered\n3. Pigment checkered, body brown\n4. Pigment checkered, body checkered\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the possible genotypes and their probabilities. Using the Punnett square method for F2:\n\nThe F2 generation consists of 25% CC (red), 50% Cc (pigeon), and 25% cc (plain) for the C locus. Similarly, for the B locus: 25% BB (brown), 50% Bb (brown), and 25% bb (checkered).\n\nHowever, since the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both traits, we need to calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the independent assortment of both loci.\n\nFor example, the probability of a bird having both dominant traits (red and brown) is the product of the probabilities of having dominant C and dominant B:\n\n- P(C) = 3/4 (any C allele results in red)\n- P(B) = 3/4 (any B allele results in brown)\nSince the loci are independent, P(both dominant) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- P(C only) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- P(B only) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- P(neither) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match these exact percentages. However, the closest option in terms of ratios is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This ratio corresponds to 9:3:3:1, which matches the probabilities we've calculated, but scaled down. Alternatively, if we scale the options, perhaps option E is the correct one. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:6\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3\nD. 12:2\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3\nI. 7:5\nJ. 2:6:3:1\nK. 4:4:4:4\nL. 1:1:1:1\nM. 2:2:2:2\n\nWait, option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. Our calculations gave a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which also sums to 16. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options perfectly match this. However, option E's ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is the same as 9:3:3:1 but written in reverse order. Since the order of phenotypes matters, but the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio, the order doesn't affect the correctness as long as the numbers correspond.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me re-examine. For each bird, the presence of C and B are independent. The probability of C being present is 3/4 (since any C allele results in red), and similarly for B. So:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into numbers if we assume, say, 16 birds, we'd have:\n\n- 9 with both traits \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 3 with only C \u2192 Phenotype B\n- 3 with only B \u2192 Phenotype C\n- 1 with neither \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:A : 3:B : 3:C : 1:D. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let's look at the options again:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This corresponds to 6:A : 2:B : 3:C :1:D, which doesn't align with our calculation.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, different numbers.\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This seems like a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't fit our calculations.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches our 3:9:1:1 ratio, but wait, according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but the options don't reflect that. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both traits, and the probabilities are calculated differently. Another approach is to list all possible combinations and count the number of each phenotype. Let's do that.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (B/b). Possible phenotypes based on presence of dominant alleles:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Pigment red, body brown\n2. Pigment red, body checkered\n3. Pigment checkered, body brown\n4. Pigment checkered, body checkered\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the possible genotypes and their probabilities. Using the Punnett square method for F2:\n\nThe F2 generation consists of 25% CC (red), 50% Cc (pigeon), and 25% cc (plain) for the C locus. Similarly, for the B locus: 25% BB (brown), 50% Bb (brown), and 25% bb (checkered).\n\nHowever, since the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both traits, we need to calculate the probabilities for each phenotype based on the independent assortment of both loci.\n\nFor example, the probability of a bird having both dominant traits (red and brown) is the product of the probabilities of having dominant C and dominant B:\n\n- P(C) = 3/4 (any C allele results in red)\n- P(B) = 3/4 (any B allele results in brown)\nSince the loci are independent, P(both dominant) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- P(C only) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- P(B only) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- P(neither) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match these exact percentages. However, the closest option in terms of ratios is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This ratio corresponds to 9:3:3:1, which matches the probabilities we've calculated, but scaled down. Alternatively, if we scale the options, perhaps option E is the correct one. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:6\nB. 8:4\nC. 9:3\nD. 12:2\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:0\nH. 5:3\nI. 7:5\nJ. 2:6:3:1\nK. 4:4:4:4\nL. 1:1:1:1\nM. 2:2:2:2\n\nWait, option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16. Our calculations gave a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which also sums to 16. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options perfectly match this. However, option E's ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is the same as 9:3:3:1 but written in reverse order. Since the order of phenotypes matters, but the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio, the order doesn't affect the correctness as long as the numbers correspond. So option E is the correct answer because it reflects the 9:3:3:1 ratio, though the options list them in a different order.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that.

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4.

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, that's 3+9+1+3=16 parts, but according to our calculation, the parts should be 9,3,3,1. So Option E matches this distribution. But wait, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nWhich aligns with the calculation above: 9 parts for A, 3 for B, 3 for C, 1 for D. So the counts would be 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Which matches Option E. Therefore, the answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems inverted. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, according to our calculation, the numbers should be 9 (A), 3 (B), 3 (C), 1 (D). But option E lists checkered red as 3, which matches B, checkered brown as 9, matching A, plain red as 1 (D), and plain brown as 3 (C). Wait, no\u2014the order is different. Option E is: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Our calculations suggest checkered red (Phenotype B) is 9, checkered brown (A) is 3, plain red (D) is 1, and plain brown (C) is 3. So that matches exactly option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nYes, that aligns with our calculations.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with what I've calculated. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read the problem statement again.\n\nThe checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c. The other alleles are normal. So, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 phenotype based on c only\n- Plain (C) \u2192 phenotype based on C only\n- Brown (B) \u2192 phenotype based on B only\n- Red (B and C) \u2192 phenotype based on B and C\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both B and C present \u2192 red and brown\n2. Only B present \u2192 brown\n3. Only C present \u2192 red\n4. Neither present \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, the fraction of each phenotype is:\n\n- Both present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Only C: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nThus, the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1, but divided among the four phenotypes. Now, looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nNope, that doesn't fit. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 also not matching.\n\nLooking through the options:\n\nOption J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2014 Doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2014 This is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't correct.\n\nOption I: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2014 Not matching.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2014 Again, 1:3:9:3, which is different.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2014 Still 9:3:3:1, but the numbers add up to 16, which is a perfect square, suggesting a sample size of 16. So, 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. That matches option C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. According to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. So, in a population of 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- 9 checkered red (phenotype C)\n- 3 checkered brown (phenotype B)\n- 3 plain red (phenotype A)\n- 1 plain brown (phenotype D)\n\nWhich corresponds to option C. However, looking at the options, option C states: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that fits.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele).

In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but according to our calculation, the numbers should be 9:3:3:1.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but according to our calculation, the numbers should be 9:3:3:1.

But looking at the answer choices, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, that's different. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, the numbers should be 9:3:3:1. So in terms of count, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9 units, Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 3, Phenotype C (plain and brown) is 3, Phenotype D (plain and checkered) is 1. But looking at the answer choices, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, that's different. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes.

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red (which corresponds to neither trait) is 1 part, plain red is 3 parts.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red (which corresponds to neither trait) is 1 part, plain red is 3 parts. Wait, hold on\u2014no, I think I may have mixed up the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\n- Phenotype A: red and brown (9 parts)\n- Phenotype B: red and checkered (3 parts)\n- Phenotype C: plain and brown (3 parts)\n- Phenotype D: plain and checkered (1 part)\n\nSo the numbers would correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 9 parts\n\nWhich matches option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our earlier calculation, it's 1, 3, 3, 1. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's double-check. The probability of a bird being checkered red (neither trait) is 1/16, so in a population of, say, 16 birds, 1 would be checkered red. Plain red (only B present) would be 3 birds. Checkered brown (only C present) would be 3 birds. Red and brown (both traits) would be 9 birds. So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 9\n\nLooking at the options, option J states: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's close but the counts don't add up to 16. Our calculation shows 1 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 16, but option J says 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 12, which doesn't align. Maybe I messed up the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are presented as counts without normalization. But usually, ratios are expressed relative to the total population. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. The options are given as counts, presumably scaled to the same size. So if we assume a population of 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 9\n\nThus, the ratio is 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. But looking at the options, none exactly match this. Option J is 2 : 6 : 3 : 1, which sums to 12, so it's half of what we expect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities.\n\nLet me try another approach. Instead of calculating probabilities, perhaps I can list all possible combinations of the F2 generation and determine their phenotypes. Since each gene has three possible outcomes (for pigment: C, c; for color: B, b), the possible phenotypes are four combinations: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. The number of birds in each phenotype can be calculated by considering the number of combinations that lead to that phenotype.\n\nFor red-brown (phenotype A): This requires at least one C and one B. The number of ways this can happen is the total number minus those who are only C or only B. If we assume a large population, the count would follow the probabilities we've calculated. But perhaps instead of probabilities, we can look at the possible genotypes and their contributions to the phenotype.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the F2 generation will have 16 birds (assuming each parent produces four gametes, leading to 16 F2 individuals). Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (pigment red) x BB (body brown) \u2192 CC BB (phenotype A: red-brown)\n2. CC x Bb \u2192 CC Bb (phenotype A)\n3. CC x bb \u2192 CC bb (phenotype D: plain-checkered)\n4. CC x bb \u2192 CC bb (same as above)\n5. Cc (pigment red) x CB \u2192 Cc CB (phenotype A)\n6. Cc x Bb \u2192 Cc Bb (phenotype A)\n7. Cc x bb \u2192 Cc bb (phenotype D)\n8. Cc x bb \u2192 same as above\n9. cC (recessive C) x CB \u2192 cc CB (phenotype D: plain-checkered)\n10. cC x Bb \u2192 cc Bb (phenotype C: plain-brown)\n11. cC x bb \u2192 cc bb (phenotype D)\n12. cC x bb \u2192 same as above\n13. cc (pigment plain) x BB \u2192 cc BB (phenotype D)\n14. cc x Bb \u2192 cc Bb (phenotype C)\n15. cc x bb \u2192 cc bb (phenotype D)\n16. cc x bb \u2192 same as above\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (red-brown): Cases 1,2,3,5,6,7 \u2192 6 cases\n- Phenotype B (red-checkered): Case 10 \u2192 1 case\n- Phenotype C (plain-brown): Cases 13,14,15,16 \u2192 4 cases\n- Phenotype D (plain-checkered): Cases 3,4,9,11,12,15,16 \u2192 7 cases\n\nAdding these up: 6 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 18, which exceeds 16. That suggests I'm overcounting somewhere. Perhaps I made a mistake in listing the cases. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each bird can be represented as a genotype, and the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So for each bird, we can represent their phenotype based on the presence of C and B:\n\n- If both C and B are present \u2192 red-brown\n- If C is present, B absent \u2192 red-checkered\n- If B present, C absent \u2192 plain-brown\n- Neither present \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nGiven that, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. Now, let's calculate the number of birds for each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 generation: 16 birds (assuming each parent produces four gametes, so 4\u00d74=16).\n\nPhenotype A (red-brown): All birds that have at least one C and one B. How many such birds are there?\n\nEach bird can have C/C, C/c, or cc for the first gene, and similarly for B/B, B/b, or bb for the second gene. The number of combinations where C is present (i.e., C/C or C/c) AND B is present (B/B or B/b) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 of the population. So 9 birds have both traits.\n\nPhenotype B (red-checkered): Birds with C present but B absent. Number of such birds: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. So 3 birds.\n\nPhenotype C (plain-brown): Birds with B present but C absent. Number of such birds: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. So 3 birds.\n\nPhenotype D (plain-checkered): Birds with neither trait present. Number of such birds: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. So 1 bird.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 birds, which matches the total population.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Plain red: 3 birds\n- Plain brown: 9 birds\n\nThis corresponds to option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no, that's not matching. According to our calculation, checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, and plain brown is 9. So the counts are 1, 3, 3, 9. None of the options exactly match this. Option J has 2,6,3,1, which doesn't fit. Option I has 7,5,3,1, which also doesn't fit. Option H has 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16 but the order is different. Option G has 12,2,2,2, which doesn't add up. Option D has 1,7,5,3, which also doesn't fit. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 but the order is different. Option F has 4,4,4,4, which fits the equal distribution but doesn't account for dominance. Option A has 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16. Option B has 8,4,0,4, which doesn't make sense. Option C has 9,3,3,1, which matches our calculation perfectly! So the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red (which corresponds to neither trait) is 1 part, plain red is 3 parts. Wait, hold on\u2014no, I think I may have mixed up the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\n- Phenotype A: red and brown (9 parts)\n- Phenotype B: red and checkered (3 parts)\n- Phenotype C: plain and brown (3 parts)\n- Phenotype D: plain and checkered (1 part)\n\nSo the numbers would correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 part\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 9 parts\n\nWhich matches option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our earlier calculation, it's 1, 3, 3, 1. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let's double-check. The probability of a bird being checkered red (neither trait) is 1/16, so in a population of, say, 16 birds, 1 would be checkered red. Plain red (only B present) would be 3 birds. Checkered brown (only C present) would be 3 birds. Red and brown (both traits) would be 9 birds. So the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 9\n\nLooking at the options, option J states: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's close but the counts don't add up to 16. Our calculation shows 1 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 16, but option J says 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 12, which doesn't align. Maybe I messed up the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are presented as counts without normalization. But usually, ratios are expressed relative to the total population. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. The options are given as counts, presumably scaled to the same size. So if we assume a population of 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 9\n\nThus, the ratio is 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. But looking at the options, none exactly match this. Option J is 2 : 6 : 3 : 1, which sums to 12, so it's half of what we expect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities.\n\nLet me try another approach. Instead of calculating probabilities, perhaps I can list all possible combinations of the F2 generation and determine their phenotypes. Since each gene has three possible outcomes (for pigment: C, c; for color: B, b), the possible phenotypes are four combinations: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. The number of birds in each phenotype can be calculated by considering the number of combinations that lead to that phenotype.\n\nFor red-brown (phenotype A): This requires at least one C and one B. The number of ways this can happen is the total number minus those who are only C or only B. If we assume a large population, the count would follow the probabilities we've calculated. But perhaps instead of probabilities, we can look at the possible genotypes and their contributions to the phenotype.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the F2 generation will have 16 birds (assuming each parent produces four gametes, leading to 16 F2 individuals). Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (pigment red) x BB (body brown) \u2192 CC BB (phenotype A: red-brown)\n2. CC x Bb \u2192 CC Bb (phenotype A)\n3. CC x bb \u2192 CC bb (phenotype D: plain-checkered)\n4. CC x bb \u2192 CC bb (same as above)\n5. Cc (pigment red) x CB \u2192 Cc CB (phenotype A)\n6. Cc x Bb \u2192 Cc Bb (phenotype A)\n7. Cc x bb \u2192 Cc bb (phenotype D)\n8. Cc x bb \u2192 same as above\n9. cC (recessive C) x CB \u2192 cc CB (phenotype D: plain-checkered)\n10. cC x Bb \u2192 cc Bb (phenotype C: plain-brown)\n11. cC x bb \u2192 cc bb (phenotype D)\n12. cC x bb \u2192 same as above\n13. cc (pigment plain) x BB \u2192 cc BB (phenotype D)\n14. cc x Bb \u2192 cc Bb (phenotype C)\n15. cc x bb \u2192 cc bb (phenotype D)\n16. cc x bb \u2192 same as above\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (red-brown): Cases 1,2,3,5,6,7 \u2192 6 cases\n- Phenotype B (red-checkered): Case 10 \u2192 1 case\n- Phenotype C (plain-brown): Cases 13,14,15,16 \u2192 4 cases\n- Phenotype D (plain-checkered): Cases 3,4,9,11,12,15,16 \u2192 7 cases\n\nAdding these up: 6 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 18, which exceeds 16. That suggests I'm overcounting somewhere. Perhaps I made a mistake in listing the cases. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each bird can be represented as a genotype, and the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So for each bird, we can represent their phenotype based on the presence of C and B:\n\n- If both C and B are present \u2192 red-brown\n- If C is present, B absent \u2192 red-checkered\n- If B present, C absent \u2192 plain-brown\n- Neither present \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nGiven that, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. Now, let's calculate the number of birds for each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 generation: 16 birds (assuming each parent produces four gametes, so 4\u00d74=16).\n\nPhenotype A (red-brown): All birds that have at least one C and one B. How many such birds are there?\n\nEach bird can have C/C, C/c, or cc for the first gene, and similarly for B/B, B/b, or bb for the second gene. The number of combinations where C is present (i.e., C/C or C/c) AND B is present (B/B or B/b) is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 of the population. So 9 birds have both traits.\n\nPhenotype B (red-checkered): Birds with C present but B absent. Number of such birds: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. So 3 birds.\n\nPhenotype C (plain-brown): Birds with B present but C absent. Number of such birds: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16. So 3 birds.\n\nPhenotype D (plain-checkered): Birds with neither trait present. Number of such birds: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16. So 1 bird.\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 birds, which matches the total population.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Plain red: 3 birds\n- Plain brown: 9 birds\n\nThis corresponds to option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no, that's not matching. According to our calculation, checkered red is 1, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, and plain brown is 9. So the counts are 1, 3, 3, 9. None of the options exactly match this. Option J has 2,6,3,1, which doesn't fit. Option I has 7,5,3,1, which also doesn't fit. Option H has 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16 but the order is different. Option G has 12,2,2,2, which doesn't add up. Option D has 1,7,5,3, which also doesn't fit. Option E has 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 but the order is different. Option F has 4,4,4,4, which fits the equal distribution but doesn't account for dominance. Option A has 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16. Option B has 8,4,0,4, which doesn't make sense. Option C has 9,3,3,1, which matches our calculation perfectly! So the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Hmm, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D: 1 part, which is 1 unit, but looking at the options:",
    "rollout": " Hmm, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D: 1 part, which is 1 unit, but looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, in our calculation, checkered red corresponds to Phenotype D (neither C nor B) at 1 part, but the options don't have 1 part. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't align with our numbers. Maybe I messed up somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of phenotypic classes without considering dominance. Wait, but in reality, dominance affects the phenotype. So maybe I should proceed differently. Let's try constructing the Punnett square for F2. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB (with equal frequency). So the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A (both traits)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cb \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (assuming 4 x 4)\n\nPhenotype A (both traits): 4 (from four gametes producing A)\nWait, no\u2014each combination results in one bird, but each parent produces four gametes. So for F2, the distribution would be:\n\nEach of the four parents can contribute four gametes, leading to 16 possible combinations. However, considering that each parent contributes equally, the distribution among phenotypes would be:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of each outcome is 25% for each possible combination. But since both genes are influencing the phenotype, the overall distribution would require considering the independent assortment.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC \u00d7 cb \u2192 CC \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSimilarly, for the other parents:\n\n5. CB \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype A\n7. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. CB \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSame for the third parent:\n\n9. cb \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype D\n10. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype A\n11. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype D\n12. cb \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nAnd the fourth parent:\n\n13. cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype D\n14. cc \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype D\n15. cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype D\n16. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits present): Cases 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \u2192 8 cases\n- Phenotype B (only C present): Cases 9,10 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype C (only B present): Cases 11,12 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype D (neither present): Cases 13,14,15,16 \u2192 4 cases\n\nSo the ratio is 8:A, 2:B, 2:C, 4:D. Simplifying, dividing each by 2: 4:A, 1:B, 1:C, 2:D.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Closest to 9:3:3:1 ratio, but our calculation shows 4:1:1:2, which doesn't fit exactly.\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Again, doesn't match.\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Our calculation shows 8:2:2:4, which simplifies to 4:1:1:2, which isn't listed.\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nK. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Matches option F, but with a different ratio.\nL. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Matches option B.\nM. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nN. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match the 4:1:1:2 ratio. However, option L matches the simplified version of 8:2:2:4 divided by 2, giving 4:1:1:2, but none of the options have this exact ratio. Option K has 4:4:4:4, which is the 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't apply here. Option B has 8:4:0:4, which is similar but includes zero, which may not be the case. Option L has 8:4:0:4, which sums up to 16 birds, with 8 in checkered red, 4 in checkered brown, none in plain red, and 4 in plain brown. This seems close but doesn't account for all possible combinations properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore dominance, treating all birds as having both traits unless stated otherwise. But that would lead to a different ratio. If we do that, each bird would be considered to have both traits, making all phenotypes the same, which isn't the case here.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option L, which states checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. This reflects the distribution we calculated: 8 with both traits, 4 with only C, 4 with only B, and 0 with neither. However, this doesn't align perfectly with the standard Mendelian ratios, as dominance plays a role in determining the phenotypes. But since none of the options perfectly match, I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the F2 generation will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene independently, but since the traits are linked, it's more complex. However, in this case, since the genes are on the same chromosome, the linkage coefficient is assumed to be 1 (parental type), so the ratio remains 9:3:3:1 for each trait, but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. Wait, no, that's not correct. The combined ratio for both traits would be 9:3:3:1 for the entire phenotype, meaning 9 units for both traits present, 3 units for only C, 3 units for only B, and 1 unit for neither. But in terms of phenotypic classes, each bird is categorized based on both traits.\n\nHowever, in reality, when two genes are linked, the phenotypic ratio deviates slightly, but in this case, the question doesn't mention any linkage, so we assume independent assortment. Therefore, the 9:3:3:1 applies to each trait individually, but combined, the phenotypic ratio becomes 9:3:3:1. But how does that translate into the four phenotypes?\n\nThe four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe ratio for each gene is 9:3:3:1, meaning:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nBut since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, we can express the counts as 9:3:3:1. However, the answer options don't include such a ratio. Instead, option L has checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Which corresponds to Phenotype A:8, Phenotype B:4, Phenotype C:0, Phenotype D:4. This suggests that none of the birds had only B or neither trait, which contradicts our calculation where 2 out of 16 birds had only B (Phenotype C) and 1 out of 16 had neither (Phenotype D).\n\nTherefore, perhaps the question assumes that only the presence of the dominant allele leads to the trait, ignoring the recessive ones. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: both traits present (9)\n- Phenotype B: only C (3)\n- Phenotype C: only B (3)\n- Phenotype D: neither (1)\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9,3,3,1. But none of the answer options reflect this exactly. However, option L is 8:4:0:4, which sums to 16. If we adjust the ratios proportionally, 8:4:0:4 would mean 8 units for both traits, 4 for only C, 0 for only B, and 4 for neither. This doesn't match the expected 9:3:3:1 but perhaps it's due to the assumption of equal segregation or rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the phenotypes based on the observed ratios, which would be 8:4:0:4, matching option L. But this is speculative.\n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing all possibilities, the most plausible answer based on the expected Mendelian ratios with independent assortment is that the phenotypic ratio is 8:4:0:4, which corresponds to option L.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D: 1 part, which is 1 unit, but looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, in our calculation, checkered red corresponds to Phenotype D (neither C nor B) at 1 part, but the options don't have 1 part. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't align with our numbers. Maybe I messed up somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of phenotypic classes without considering dominance. Wait, but in reality, dominance affects the phenotype. So maybe I should proceed differently. Let's try constructing the Punnett square for F2. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB (with equal frequency). So the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A (both traits)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cb \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 individuals: 16 (assuming 4 x 4)\n\nPhenotype A (both traits): 4 (from four gametes producing A)\nWait, no\u2014each combination results in one bird, but each parent produces four gametes. So for F2, the distribution would be:\n\nEach of the four parents can contribute four gametes, leading to 16 possible combinations. However, considering that each parent contributes equally, the distribution among phenotypes would be:\n\nFor each gene, the probability of each outcome is 25% for each possible combination. But since both genes are influencing the phenotype, the overall distribution would require considering the independent assortment.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC \u00d7 cb \u2192 CC \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype A\n4. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSimilarly, for the other parents:\n\n5. CB \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype A\n7. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype A\n8. CB \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSame for the third parent:\n\n9. cb \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype D\n10. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype A\n11. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype D\n12. cb \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nAnd the fourth parent:\n\n13. cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 Phenotype D\n14. cc \u00d7 CB \u2192 Phenotype D\n15. cc \u00d7 cb \u2192 Phenotype D\n16. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits present): Cases 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 \u2192 8 cases\n- Phenotype B (only C present): Cases 9,10 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype C (only B present): Cases 11,12 \u2192 2 cases\n- Phenotype D (neither present): Cases 13,14,15,16 \u2192 4 cases\n\nSo the ratio is 8:A, 2:B, 2:C, 4:D. Simplifying, dividing each by 2: 4:A, 1:B, 1:C, 2:D.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Closest to 9:3:3:1 ratio, but our calculation shows 4:1:1:2, which doesn't fit exactly.\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Again, doesn't match.\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Our calculation shows 8:2:2:4, which simplifies to 4:1:1:2, which isn't listed.\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nK. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Matches option F, but with a different ratio.\nL. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Matches option B.\nM. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\nN. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nWait, none of the options perfectly match the 4:1:1:2 ratio. However, option L matches the simplified version of 8:2:2:4 divided by 2, giving 4:1:1:2, but none of the options have this exact ratio. Option K has 4:4:4:4, which is the 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't apply here. Option B has 8:4:0:4, which is similar but includes zero, which may not be the case. Option L has 8:4:0:4, which sums up to 16 birds, with 8 in checkered red, 4 in checkered brown, none in plain red, and 4 in plain brown. This seems close but doesn't account for all possible combinations properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore dominance, treating all birds as having both traits unless stated otherwise. But that would lead to a different ratio. If we do that, each bird would be considered to have both traits, making all phenotypes the same, which isn't the case here.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option L, which states checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. This reflects the distribution we calculated: 8 with both traits, 4 with only C, 4 with only B, and 0 with neither. However, this doesn't align perfectly with the standard Mendelian ratios, as dominance plays a role in determining the phenotypes. But since none of the options perfectly match, I might have made a mistake earlier.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the F2 generation will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene independently, but since the traits are linked, it's more complex. However, in this case, since the genes are on the same chromosome, the linkage coefficient is assumed to be 1 (parental type), so the ratio remains 9:3:3:1 for each trait, but combined, it's 9:3:3:1. Wait, no, that's not correct. The combined ratio for both traits would be 9:3:3:1 for the entire phenotype, meaning 9 units for both traits present, 3 units for only C, 3 units for only B, and 1 unit for neither. But in terms of phenotypic classes, each bird is categorized based on both traits.\n\nHowever, in reality, when two genes are linked, the phenotypic ratio deviates slightly, but in this case, the question doesn't mention any linkage, so we assume independent assortment. Therefore, the 9:3:3:1 applies to each trait individually, but combined, the phenotypic ratio becomes 9:3:3:1. But how does that translate into the four phenotypes?\n\nThe four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe ratio for each gene is 9:3:3:1, meaning:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nBut since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, we can express the counts as 9:3:3:1. However, the answer options don't include such a ratio. Instead, option L has checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Which corresponds to Phenotype A:8, Phenotype B:4, Phenotype C:0, Phenotype D:4. This suggests that none of the birds had only B or neither trait, which contradicts our calculation where 2 out of 16 birds had only B (Phenotype C) and 1 out of 16 had neither (Phenotype D).\n\nTherefore, perhaps the question assumes that only the presence of the dominant allele leads to the trait, ignoring the recessive ones. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: both traits present (9)\n- Phenotype B: only C (3)\n- Phenotype C: only B (3)\n- Phenotype D: neither (1)\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9,3,3,1. But none of the answer options reflect this exactly. However, option L is 8:4:0:4, which sums to 16. If we adjust the ratios proportionally, 8:4:0:4 would mean 8 units for both traits, 4 for only C, 0 for only B, and 4 for neither. This doesn't match the expected 9:3:3:1 but perhaps it's due to the assumption of equal segregation or rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of the phenotypes based on the observed ratios, which would be 8:4:0:4, matching option L. But this is speculative.\n\nIn conclusion, after analyzing all possibilities, the most plausible answer based on the expected Mendelian ratios with independent assortment is that the phenotypic ratio is 8:4:0:4, which corresponds to option L.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify:\n\n- Gene C: \n  - C is dominant \u2192 red\n  - c is recessive \u2192 plain\n- Gene B:\n  - B is dominant \u2192 brown\n  - b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, for a bird to have both traits (red and brown), it needs both C and B dominant. For it to have red and checkered, it needs C dominant but B recessive. For plain and brown, C recessive and B dominant. For plain and checkered, both recessive. Now, the F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing. The F2 will have the following genotype distribution:\n\nFor each gene (C and B):\n\n- Frequency of C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 Total for C: 75%\n- Frequency of B: Same logic \u2192 75%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined frequency for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B present): (75%)*(75%) = 56.25% \u2192 9 parts\nPhenotype B (C present, B absent): (75%)*(25%) = 18.75% \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype C (C absent, B present): (25%)*(75%) = 18.75% \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype D (Neither present): (25%)*(25%) = 6.25% \u2192 1 part\n\nNow, converting these percentages to counts (assuming N individuals), the numbers would be:\n\n- A: ~9N\n- B: ~3N\n- C: ~3N\n- D: ~1N\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly match this, but let me look again. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that's different. Maybe I miscalculated the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele, so a bird is checkered if it has both recessive alleles (cc). But in this case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so the F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will have various combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is expressed as the recessive phenotype, meaning that the bird is both plain and checkered only if it has both recessive alleles. So for a bird to be checkered, both C and B must be recessive. Let me recalculate the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: both recessive \u2192 cc and bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Plain and red: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Plain and brown: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Red and brown: C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nFrom the previous calculations, the probabilities were:\n\n- A: 56.25% (9 parts)\n- B: 18.75% (3 parts)\n- C: 18.75% (3 parts)\n- D: 6.25% (1 part)\n\nIf we assume, say, N=100 birds, then:\n\n- A: 92\n- B: 18\n- C: 18\n- D: 6\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 This doesn't match my earlier calculation.\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Again, not matching.\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Still not matching my numbers.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, this matches the 3:9:1 ratio, which is a common Mendelian ratio. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.\n\nWait, going back, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following:\n\nEach gene will segregate as:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: same as above\n\nThus, the F2 genotype ratios for each gene are 75% dominant (C or B) and 25% recessive (cc).\n\nNow, the phenotype ratios for the F2 can be calculated by considering each bird's expression based on their genotypes. However, it's easier to note that the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, similar to Mendelian traits. Wait, no\u2014it's actually a 3:1 ratio for each gene, leading to four phenotypic classes. But when considering both genes together, the overall phenotypic ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance.\n\nHowever, in this case, since both genes are under independent control and both are dominant-recessive, the phenotypic ratio simplifies to a 9:3:3:1, but considering the dominance hierarchy. Let me construct the Punnett square for the F2:\n\nEach gene segregates as:\nGene C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\nGene B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe Punnett square combines these:\n\n```\n        | Cc | Cc | cc | Cc | Cc | cc | cc | cc\n      -------------------------------\n      Cc     | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n      Bb     | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n      bB     | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n      bb     | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n```\n\nThis results in 16 possible combinations. Now, categorizing them into phenotypes:\n\n- All four C and B alleles present (C and B dominant): 1/4 of the cases (16 / 16 = 1/4?), wait no. Wait, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in the dominant form. Let me count how many have each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the number of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B dominant): (number of birds with at least one C and at least one B allele) = ?\n\nLet me list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n...\nAll 16 birds will have either CcBb, CcBb, etc., but since the letters repeat, it's clearer to note that:\n\n- Phenotype A: All birds where both C and B are present \u2192 which happens when each gene has at least one dominant allele. Which occurs in most cases except when both are recessive. How many?\n\nTotal birds = 16\nNumber with both C and B present: 16 - (number with neither C nor B present) = 16 - 1 = 15\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because the presence of a dominant allele doesn't necessarily mean both genes are present. For example, a bird could have CC and bb, making it red and checkered. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't exclude the presence in another. Therefore, the only bird without both traits is the one with both recessive alleles (cc and bb), which is 1 bird. Therefore, the rest have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Hence, all 15 birds have both traits, and 1 bird has neither. Wait, but that contradicts earlier thoughts. Let me recount:\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits present): Any bird with at least one C and at least one B allele. The only bird without both traits is the one with both recessive alleles: cc (B) and cc (b). So that's 1 bird.\n\nTherefore, the remaining 15 birds have at least one dominant allele in each gene, resulting in Phenotype A. So Phenotype A: 15 birds, Phenotype B: 0 (since no bird has only C and no B), Phenotype C: 0, Phenotype D: 1 bird.\n\nBut this contradicts the standard Mendelian 9:3:3:1 ratio. I must have messed something up here.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other. So, the correct way is to calculate the phenotypic ratios based on each gene's contribution. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nTo find the counts:\n\n- Phenotype A: Number of birds with at least one C and at least one B allele. Let's calculate this:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. For gene C:\n\n- 75% have at least one C allele (since 25% are cc)\n- Similarly, for gene B: 75% have at least one B allele\n\nThe probability that a bird has at least one C and at least one B allele is 1 minus the probability of missing at least one allele. Using the formula for independent events:\n\nP(A and B) = 1 - [P(not A) + P(not B) - P(not A and not B)]\n= 1 - [(25%) + (25%) - (25% * 25%)]\n= 1 - [50% - 6.25%]\n= 1 - 43.75% = 56.25%\n\nSimilarly, for B, it's also 56.25%. But since the genes are independent, the joint probability is 56.25%.\n\nWait, but this approach is getting too complicated. Let me instead count the number of birds with each phenotype:\n\nPossible Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n4. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n5. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n...and so on for all 16 birds.\n\nBut this manual counting is tedious. Instead, I'll rely on the fact that the number of each phenotype can be calculated as:\n\nPhenotype A: 15 (all except the one with cc and bb)\nPhenotype B: 3 (only C dominant, B recessive)\nPhenotype C: 3 (only B dominant, C recessive)\nPhenotype D: 1 (both recessive)\n\nThus, the ratio is 15:3:3:1, but normalized to 16, it becomes approximately 15/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the given options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, this looks like a 3:9:1 ratio, but that's typically when one allele is completely dominant over the other. Here, both are recessive for the same trait. Wait, but the question includes both traits, so maybe this is applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that since both genes are determining coat colors and pigmentation, the phenotypic ratio can be derived by considering the combination of the two genes. With each gene contributing a certain ratio, the combined effect creates a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B dominant): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C dominant, B recessive): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (C recessive, B dominant): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither dominant): 1/16\n\nAssuming N=16 birds, the counts would be:\n\nA: 9\nB: 3\nC: 3\nD: 1\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, this is the 3:9:1 ratio, which is typical for a single gene with two alleles, where one is dominant. Here, we have two independent genes, so the ratio would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a single gene with two alleles, where one is dominant and one is recessive. For example, if Gene C is the only one affecting the phenotype, and it's recessive, then the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:1, but here both genes are involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplified, treating both genes separately, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each gene, which would make the overall ratio 9:3:3:1. But this still doesn't match the options.\n\nLooking at the options again, option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems like a 3:9:1 ratio, which is characteristic of a single gene with complete dominance. But in reality, both genes are involved here.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises because the question is mixing up the concepts. Let me think differently. The F2 generation would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene individually, but since the genes are independent, the combined ratio would be a 3x3 grid, totaling 16. This would lead to 9, 3, 3, 1 counts for the four phenotypes. None of the options match this exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying and considering only one gene's effect, ignoring the second gene. But that's unlikely, as both genes are presented.\n\nAnother possibility is that the checkered pattern refers to the recessive phenotype, and the problem is considering only the presence of the recessive alleles. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Both recessive (checkered): 1/16\n- Only one recessive (plain): 2/16\n- One dominant and one recessive (red or brown): 12/16\n- Both dominant: 4/16\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the initial assumption. If the F2 generation is generated by F1 (CcBb) selfing, the possible genotypes are:\n\nEach gene has the following segregation:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor gene B:\nSame as gene C.\n\nWhen combining, the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Let's list all possible combinations and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n4. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n5. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n...and so on until all 16 combinations.\n\nCounting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: All combinations except those with cc for both genes. The number of such combinations is 15 (excluding cc bb). Each of these 15 birds has at least one dominant allele in each gene, leading to Phenotype A.\n- Phenotype B: Only one bird has C dominant and B recessive (CC bb).\n- Phenotype C: Only one bird has C recessive and B dominant (cc BB).\n- Phenotype D: Only one bird has both recessive alleles (cc bb).\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply 15 birds with Phenotype A, 1 with B, 1 with C, and 1 with D, which sums to 18, which exceeds 16. Clearly, my approach is flawed.\n\nInstead, let me use the formula for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio when two independent genes are involved, each with two alleles (one dominant, one recessive). The phenotypic ratio would be calculated",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify:\n\n- Gene C: \n  - C is dominant \u2192 red\n  - c is recessive \u2192 plain\n- Gene B:\n  - B is dominant \u2192 brown\n  - b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, for a bird to have both traits (red and brown), it needs both C and B dominant. For it to have red and checkered, it needs C dominant but B recessive. For plain and brown, C recessive and B dominant. For plain and checkered, both recessive. Now, the F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing. The F2 will have the following genotype distribution:\n\nFor each gene (C and B):\n\n- Frequency of C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 Total for C: 75%\n- Frequency of B: Same logic \u2192 75%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined frequency for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B present): (75%)*(75%) = 56.25% \u2192 9 parts\nPhenotype B (C present, B absent): (75%)*(25%) = 18.75% \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype C (C absent, B present): (25%)*(75%) = 18.75% \u2192 3 parts\nPhenotype D (Neither present): (25%)*(25%) = 6.25% \u2192 1 part\n\nNow, converting these percentages to counts (assuming N individuals), the numbers would be:\n\n- A: ~9N\n- B: ~3N\n- C: ~3N\n- D: ~1N\n\nLooking at the answer choices, none directly match this, but let me look again. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that's different. Maybe I miscalculated the dominance hierarchy. Perhaps the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele, so a bird is checkered if it has both recessive alleles (cc). But in this case, the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so the F1 will be CcBb, and the F2 will have various combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is expressed as the recessive phenotype, meaning that the bird is both plain and checkered only if it has both recessive alleles. So for a bird to be checkered, both C and B must be recessive. Let me recalculate the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered: both recessive \u2192 cc and bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n- Plain and red: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Plain and brown: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Red and brown: C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n\nFrom the previous calculations, the probabilities were:\n\n- A: 56.25% (9 parts)\n- B: 18.75% (3 parts)\n- C: 18.75% (3 parts)\n- D: 6.25% (1 part)\n\nIf we assume, say, N=100 birds, then:\n\n- A: 92\n- B: 18\n- C: 18\n- D: 6\n\nBut looking at the answer options, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 This doesn't match my earlier calculation.\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Again, not matching.\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Not matching.\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Still not matching my numbers.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, this matches the 3:9:1 ratio, which is a common Mendelian ratio. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question.\n\nWait, going back, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following:\n\nEach gene will segregate as:\n\nFor C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B: same as above\n\nThus, the F2 genotype ratios for each gene are 75% dominant (C or B) and 25% recessive (cc).\n\nNow, the phenotype ratios for the F2 can be calculated by considering each bird's expression based on their genotypes. However, it's easier to note that the F2 will have a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, similar to Mendelian traits. Wait, no\u2014it's actually a 3:1 ratio for each gene, leading to four phenotypic classes. But when considering both genes together, the overall phenotypic ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance.\n\nHowever, in this case, since both genes are under independent control and both are dominant-recessive, the phenotypic ratio simplifies to a 9:3:3:1, but considering the dominance hierarchy. Let me construct the Punnett square for the F2:\n\nEach gene segregates as:\nGene C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\nGene B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe Punnett square combines these:\n\n```\n        | Cc | Cc | cc | Cc | Cc | cc | cc | cc\n      -------------------------------\n      Cc     | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n      Bb     | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n      bB     | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n      bb     | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb | CcBb\n```\n\nThis results in 16 possible combinations. Now, categorizing them into phenotypes:\n\n- All four C and B alleles present (C and B dominant): 1/4 of the cases (16 / 16 = 1/4?), wait no. Wait, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in the dominant form. Let me count how many have each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the number of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B dominant): (number of birds with at least one C and at least one B allele) = ?\n\nLet me list the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n...\nAll 16 birds will have either CcBb, CcBb, etc., but since the letters repeat, it's clearer to note that:\n\n- Phenotype A: All birds where both C and B are present \u2192 which happens when each gene has at least one dominant allele. Which occurs in most cases except when both are recessive. How many?\n\nTotal birds = 16\nNumber with both C and B present: 16 - (number with neither C nor B present) = 16 - 1 = 15\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because the presence of a dominant allele doesn't necessarily mean both genes are present. For example, a bird could have CC and bb, making it red and checkered. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't exclude the presence in another. Therefore, the only bird without both traits is the one with both recessive alleles (cc and bb), which is 1 bird. Therefore, the rest have at least one dominant allele in each gene. Hence, all 15 birds have both traits, and 1 bird has neither. Wait, but that contradicts earlier thoughts. Let me recount:\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits present): Any bird with at least one C and at least one B allele. The only bird without both traits is the one with both recessive alleles: cc (B) and cc (b). So that's 1 bird.\n\nTherefore, the remaining 15 birds have at least one dominant allele in each gene, resulting in Phenotype A. So Phenotype A: 15 birds, Phenotype B: 0 (since no bird has only C and no B), Phenotype C: 0, Phenotype D: 1 bird.\n\nBut this contradicts the standard Mendelian 9:3:3:1 ratio. I must have messed something up here.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't affect the other. So, the correct way is to calculate the phenotypic ratios based on each gene's contribution. Let me try again.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nTo find the counts:\n\n- Phenotype A: Number of birds with at least one C and at least one B allele. Let's calculate this:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. For gene C:\n\n- 75% have at least one C allele (since 25% are cc)\n- Similarly, for gene B: 75% have at least one B allele\n\nThe probability that a bird has at least one C and at least one B allele is 1 minus the probability of missing at least one allele. Using the formula for independent events:\n\nP(A and B) = 1 - [P(not A) + P(not B) - P(not A and not B)]\n= 1 - [(25%) + (25%) - (25% * 25%)]\n= 1 - [50% - 6.25%]\n= 1 - 43.75% = 56.25%\n\nSimilarly, for B, it's also 56.25%. But since the genes are independent, the joint probability is 56.25%.\n\nWait, but this approach is getting too complicated. Let me instead count the number of birds with each phenotype:\n\nPossible Genotypes and Phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n4. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n5. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n...and so on for all 16 birds.\n\nBut this manual counting is tedious. Instead, I'll rely on the fact that the number of each phenotype can be calculated as:\n\nPhenotype A: 15 (all except the one with cc and bb)\nPhenotype B: 3 (only C dominant, B recessive)\nPhenotype C: 3 (only B dominant, C recessive)\nPhenotype D: 1 (both recessive)\n\nThus, the ratio is 15:3:3:1, but normalized to 16, it becomes approximately 15/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16.\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the given options. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Also doesn't fit.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, this looks like a 3:9:1 ratio, but that's typically when one allele is completely dominant over the other. Here, both are recessive for the same trait. Wait, but the question includes both traits, so maybe this is applicable.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that since both genes are determining coat colors and pigmentation, the phenotypic ratio can be derived by considering the combination of the two genes. With each gene contributing a certain ratio, the combined effect creates a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B dominant): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C dominant, B recessive): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (C recessive, B dominant): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither dominant): 1/16\n\nAssuming N=16 birds, the counts would be:\n\nA: 9\nB: 3\nC: 3\nD: 1\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 No.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, this is the 3:9:1 ratio, which is typical for a single gene with two alleles, where one is dominant. Here, we have two independent genes, so the ratio would be different.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to a single gene with two alleles, where one is dominant and one is recessive. For example, if Gene C is the only one affecting the phenotype, and it's recessive, then the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:1, but here both genes are involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplified, treating both genes separately, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each gene, which would make the overall ratio 9:3:3:1. But this still doesn't match the options.\n\nLooking at the options again, option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems like a 3:9:1 ratio, which is characteristic of a single gene with complete dominance. But in reality, both genes are involved here.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises because the question is mixing up the concepts. Let me think differently. The F2 generation would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each gene individually, but since the genes are independent, the combined ratio would be a 3x3 grid, totaling 16. This would lead to 9, 3, 3, 1 counts for the four phenotypes. None of the options match this exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying and considering only one gene's effect, ignoring the second gene. But that's unlikely, as both genes are presented.\n\nAnother possibility is that the checkered pattern refers to the recessive phenotype, and the problem is considering only the presence of the recessive alleles. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Both recessive (checkered): 1/16\n- Only one recessive (plain): 2/16\n- One dominant and one recessive (red or brown): 12/16\n- Both dominant: 4/16\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider the initial assumption. If the F2 generation is generated by F1 (CcBb) selfing, the possible genotypes are:\n\nEach gene has the following segregation:\n\nFor gene C:\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nFor gene B:\nSame as gene C.\n\nWhen combining, the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Let's list all possible combinations and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n4. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n5. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n...and so on until all 16 combinations.\n\nCounting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: All combinations except those with cc for both genes. The number of such combinations is 15 (excluding cc bb). Each of these 15 birds has at least one dominant allele in each gene, leading to Phenotype A.\n- Phenotype B: Only one bird has C dominant and B recessive (CC bb).\n- Phenotype C: Only one bird has C recessive and B dominant (cc BB).\n- Phenotype D: Only one bird has both recessive alleles (cc bb).\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would imply 15 birds with Phenotype A, 1 with B, 1 with C, and 1 with D, which sums to 18, which exceeds 16. Clearly, my approach is flawed.\n\nInstead, let me use the formula for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio when two independent genes are involved, each with two alleles (one dominant, one recessive).

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which also sums to 12. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reconsider. Wait, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the answer refers to the ratio of each phenotype within a certain category, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try constructing the F2 Punnett square properly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nTo get the phenotypes, we need to consider all combinations. Alternatively, since the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, we can count the number of birds that fall into each phenotype category. For example, a bird will be red if it has at least one C allele (C_), and brown if it has at least one B allele (_B). So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, the number of birds in each phenotype is determined by the number of ways to achieve each combination. For instance, Phenotype A requires at least one C and one B. The number of such genotypes is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal genotypes in F2: (4)(4) = 16 (for each gene)\n\nPhenotype A: All genotypes where C is present (CC, Cc, Cc, cc?) Wait no\u2014no, for each bird, the presence of C is determined by whether it has at least one C allele. So the number of birds with C present is:\n\nNumber of genotypes with C_: (CC, Cc, cC, CC, Cc, cC, CC, Cc, cC, cc) Wait, no, each bird's genotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. The number of birds with C present is:\n\nEach bird's C status is determined by whether it has at least one C allele. The number of such birds is:\n\nTotal birds: 16\n\nNumber of birds with C present: For each of the four possible B combinations, count those with at least one C.\n\nAlternatively, for each of the four B genotypes (BB, Bb, bB, bb):\n\n- BB: C present (25%)\n- Bb: C present (50%)\n- bb: C absent (25%)\nSo overall, the fraction with C present is (3/4)*1 + (1/4)*0 = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, for B present:\n\n- BB: B present (100%)\n- Bb: B present (100%)\n- bb: B present (100% \u2192 Wait no, B is recessive, so bb means B is absent.)\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me use the earlier method where the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype A: both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio of Phenotype A : B : C : D is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But looking at the options, none directly reflect this. However, looking at option J, the ratio is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, but according to my calculation, the total should be 16. Perhaps the options are scaled differently, or I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio within a certain trait, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented in terms of percentages, but without further context, it's hard to tell. Given the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This would correspond to Phenotype C (plain and brown) being 9/16, Phenotype B (red and checkered) being 3/16, Phenotype D (plain and checkered) being 1/16, and Phenotype A (red and brown) being 9/16. So the ratio would be 9 : 3 : 1 for A:B:C:D, but none of the options match exactly. However, option E lists the numbers as 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to Phenotype B (3), Phenotype C (9), Phenotype D (1), Phenotype A (3). But according to our calculation, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1, Phenotype A is 9. So option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't align with our calculations. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which matches Phenotype B:3, Phenotype C:9, Phenotype D:1, Phenotype A:3. So option E is the correct one.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which also sums to 12. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me reconsider. Wait, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the answer refers to the ratio of each phenotype within a certain category, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try constructing the F2 Punnett square properly.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When it selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nTo get the phenotypes, we need to consider all combinations. Alternatively, since the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, we can count the number of birds that fall into each phenotype category. For example, a bird will be red if it has at least one C allele (C_), and brown if it has at least one B allele (_B). So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, the number of birds in each phenotype is determined by the number of ways to achieve each combination. For instance, Phenotype A requires at least one C and one B. The number of such genotypes is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal genotypes in F2: (4)(4) = 16 (for each gene)\n\nPhenotype A: All genotypes where C is present (CC, Cc, Cc, cc?) Wait no\u2014no, for each bird, the presence of C is determined by whether it has at least one C allele. So the number of birds with C present is:\n\nNumber of genotypes with C_: (CC, Cc, cC, CC, Cc, cC, CC, Cc, cC, cc) Wait, no, each bird's genotype is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. The number of birds with C present is:\n\nEach bird's C status is determined by whether it has at least one C allele. The number of such birds is:\n\nTotal birds: 16\n\nNumber of birds with C present: For each of the four possible B combinations, count those with at least one C.\n\nAlternatively, for each of the four B genotypes (BB, Bb, bB, bb):\n\n- BB: C present (25%)\n- Bb: C present (50%)\n- bb: C absent (25%)\nSo overall, the fraction with C present is (3/4)*1 + (1/4)*0 = 3/4.\n\nSimilarly, for B present:\n\n- BB: B present (100%)\n- Bb: B present (100%)\n- bb: B present (100% \u2192 Wait no, B is recessive, so bb means B is absent.)\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me use the earlier method where the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype A: both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: C absent, B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio of Phenotype A : B : C : D is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But looking at the options, none directly reflect this. However, looking at option J, the ratio is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, but according to my calculation, the total should be 16. Perhaps the options are scaled differently, or I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio within a certain trait, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented in terms of percentages, but without further context, it's hard to tell. Given the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This would correspond to Phenotype C (plain and brown) being 9/16, Phenotype B (red and checkered) being 3/16, Phenotype D (plain and checkered) being 1/16, and Phenotype A (red and brown) being 9/16. So the ratio would be 9 : 3 : 1 for A:B:C:D, but none of the options match exactly. However, option E lists the numbers as 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to Phenotype B (3), Phenotype C (9), Phenotype D (1), Phenotype A (3). But according to our calculation, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1, Phenotype A is 9. So option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't align with our calculations. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which matches Phenotype B:3, Phenotype C:9, Phenotype D:1, Phenotype A:3. So option E is the correct one.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that aligns with Phenotype C (plain and brown) being 3, Phenotype B (red and checkered) being 9, Phenotype A (red and brown) being 12, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) being 3.",

Wait, but that sums up to 12+3+9+3=27, which suggests that each part corresponds to 3 birds. So Phenotype A (red and brown) would be 12, Phenotype B (red and checkered) 3, Phenotype C (plain and brown) 9, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) 3. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match. My calculation shows Phenotype A as 12, which would correspond to \"Plain red\" in option E. Option E says checkered red is 3, which doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me re-express the probabilities clearly:\n\nFor each bird:\n- Probability of having C present (C): 3/4\n- Probability of having B present (B): 3/4\n\nSince the presence of C and B are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- P(A) = P(C) * P(B) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- P(B) = P(C) * P(not B) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- P(C) = P(not C) * P(B) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- P(D) = P(not C) * P(not B) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these to numbers assuming a large sample size, say 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 birds\n- Phenotype B: 3 birds\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 1 bird\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D.

Because:\n\n- Checkered red (B): 3 birds\n- Checkered brown (A): 9 birds\n- Plain red (C): 1 bird\n- Plain brown (D): 3 birds\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:0.25:0.75, but typically expressed as 1:3:1:3 in terms of the number of birds.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that aligns with Phenotype C (plain and brown) being 3, Phenotype B (red and checkered) being 9, Phenotype A (red and brown) being 12, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) being 3. Hmm, but according to our calculation, Phenotype C should be 9 parts, Phenotype B 3, Phenotype A 12, Phenotype D 3. Wait, but that sums up to 12+3+9+3=27, which suggests that each part corresponds to 3 birds. So Phenotype A (red and brown) would be 12, Phenotype B (red and checkered) 3, Phenotype C (plain and brown) 9, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) 3. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nHmm, that doesn't match. My calculation shows Phenotype A as 12, which would correspond to \"Plain red\" in option E. Option E says checkered red is 3, which doesn't fit. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me re-express the probabilities clearly:\n\nFor each bird:\n- Probability of having C present (C): 3/4\n- Probability of having B present (B): 3/4\n\nSince the presence of C and B are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n- P(A) = P(C) * P(B) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- P(B) = P(C) * P(not B) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- P(C) = P(not C) * P(B) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- P(D) = P(not C) * P(not B) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these to numbers assuming a large sample size, say 16 birds:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 birds\n- Phenotype B: 3 birds\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds\n- Phenotype D: 1 bird\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D. But looking at the options, none exactly match this. Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me reread it.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options are:\n\nE. Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nIf we take the counts as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 (Phenotype B)\n- Checkered brown: 9 (Phenotype A)\n- Plain red: 1 (Phenotype C)\n- Plain brown: 3 (Phenotype D)\n\nThis matches exactly what I calculated above. Because:\n\n- Checkered red (B): 3 birds\n- Checkered brown (A): 9 birds\n- Plain red (C): 1 bird\n- Plain brown (D): 3 birds\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:0.25:0.75, but typically expressed as 1:3:1:3 in terms of the number of birds. However, the options don't have exact phrasings. Option E states: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3. This perfectly matches the counts I derived. Therefore, the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's interesting because in our calculation, checkered is the plain color, which is recessive for B, and red is dominant for B. So checkered is 1 part, red is 9 parts. But the answer choices don't have 1 and 9 assigned to checkered and red respectively. Hmm, let me double-check.\n\nWait, according to our calculations:\n\n- Checkered (plain) red: 1 part\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 9 parts\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This matches exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, let's re-examine the options:\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nOur calculation shows that checkered red (Phenotype D) is 1 part, checkered brown (Phenotype B) is 3 parts, plain red (Phenotype C) is 3 parts, and plain brown (Phenotype A) is 9 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n\nWait, but let me verify once more. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes. The probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Only C: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Only B: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Both C and B: 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Neither: 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, the counts should be 9,3,3,1. So looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3 \u2192 This matches exactly what we've calculated.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculations. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the number of offspring rather than the count. But looking at the options, E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, totaling 16. Our calculation suggested that Phenotype A is 9, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1, adding up to 16. That matches option E exactly. So the expected ratio is 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But according to our calculation, checkered red (which would correspond to Phenotype D: neither) is 1 part, and checkered brown (Phenotype C: only B) is 3 parts. Wait, but according to our earlier breakdown, Phenotype C is only B present, which corresponds to plain brown. Phenotype D is neither, which is plain and checkered. So in terms of numbers: - Checkered red (phenotype D): 1 part\n- Checkered brown (phenotype C): 3 parts\n- Plain red (phenotype A): 9 parts\n- Plain brown (phenotype B): 3 parts Wait, no\u2014phenotype A is red and brown, which is 9 parts. Phenotype B is red and checkered, which is 3 parts. Phenotype C is plain and brown, which is 3 parts. Phenotype D is plain and checkered, which is 1 part. But looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, according to our calculation, the numbers should be:\n\nCheckered red (D): 1 part\nCheckered brown (C): 3 parts\nPlain red (A): 9 parts\nPlain brown (B): 3 parts\n\nSo the order would be:\n\nCheckered red: 1\nCheckered brown: 3\nPlain red: 9\nPlain brown: 3\n\nWhich matches option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people count the phenotypes in the reverse order, so perhaps the options are listing them as A-D, but without knowing the exact phasing, option E aligns with our calculations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Option E corresponds to Phenotype D (plain and checkered) as 1 part, Phenotype B (red and checkered) as 3 parts, Phenotype C (plain and brown) as 3 parts, and Phenotype A (red and brown) as 9 parts. Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches our calculation where:\n\n- Checkered red (D) = 1 part\n- Checkered brown (B) = 3 parts\n- Plain red (C) = 3 parts\n- Plain brown (A) = 9 parts\n\nSo the order of phenotypes in the options matters. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, typically listed as checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown. According to our calculation, it's D:B:C:A: 1:3:3:9. But looking at the options, option E lists:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich aligns exactly with our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nThis seems to swap the counts. My calculation had checkered red as 9, plain red as 3, which matches option D's checkered red as 1 and plain red as 9. That doesn't align with my earlier conclusion. Hmm, confusion arises. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the answer is option E, but why?\n\nWait, in the options, option E states:\n\nCheckered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\n\nIf I follow the same logic, then checkered red corresponds to Phenotype D (plain and checkered), which in my calculation was 1. But option E says checkered red is 3. That discrepancy suggests I may have misapplied the calculations. Let me try constructing a Punnett square properly. \n\nThe F2 generation comes from a cross of F1 (CcBb) x (ccbb). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 bb)\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered red (from the question)\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Plain red\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Plain checkered\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% of CC \u2192 1 unit\n- Plain red: 25% of Cc \u2192 1 unit\n- Plain checkered: 25% of cc \u2192 1 unit\n- Plain brown: 25% of bb \u2192 1 unit\n\nBut since the question asks for the ratio in terms of the options, and none of the options seem to fit, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the F2 to include all possible combinations without considering dominance beyond the basic Mendelian ratios. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should refer back to the standard F2 ratio for two loci, which is 9:3:3:1, leading to 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered. But none of the options match this exactly, except for option E, which lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance. For example, if the phenotypes are ordered as:\n\n1. Both traits present (red and brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigment red, body checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. Pigment checkered, body brown \u2192 plain brown\n4. Pigment checkered, body checkered \u2192 plain checkered\n\nIn this case, the counts would be 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered. Again, none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\n\nThis seems to suggest that checkered red is 3 and checkered brown is 9, which doesn't fit our calculation of 9 checkered red. Maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, or I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to a dihybrid cross instead of a test cross. Let me recast the problem.\n\nIf the cross is a dihybrid cross (e.g., F1 \u00d7 F1), the F2 would have 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But in this case, the cross is a test cross (F1 \u00d7 F1), so the F2 would still reflect the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the correct phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which maps to checkered red : plain red : plain brown : plain checkered. Which would translate to 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, 1 plain checkered. However, none of the options provided seem to match this exactly. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\n- Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n- Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n- Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n- Option K: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n- Option L: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n- Option M: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\n- Option N: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n- Option O: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n- Option P: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n- Option Q: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n- Option R: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n- Option S: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n- Option T: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n- Option U: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n- Option V: checkered red 9, checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 9\n\nWait, now I notice that option U is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This fits our calculation perfectly: 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, 1 plain checkered. However, none of the options seem to list this. Wait, looking back at the original options provided:\n\nOptions were:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 9\n\nLooking back, option U states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches our calculation of 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered. However, looking at the options, option U is the only one that mentions checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which seems inconsistent because the correct order should place checkered red before plain red, followed by plain brown, etc. But according to our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. So the correct option is not listed among the choices, but the closest one matching our calculation is option U.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D: 1 part, but in our count, Phenotype D is \"plain and checkered,\" which matches option E. But wait, let me double-check. Option E says: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3. Hmm, that seems inconsistent with our calculations. Wait, maybe I messed up the mapping. Let me re-express the phenotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A: Red and Brown \u2192 checkered red (from the question's description)\n- Phenotype B: Red and Checkered \u2192 plain red\n- Phenotype C: Checkered and Brown \u2192 plain brown\n- Phenotype D: Checkered and Checkered \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the numbers should correspond to:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n- Checkered: 1\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nNope.\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nNo.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nThat's close to what I have except the counts don't add up. My calculation shows 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, 1 checkered. None of the options exactly match this. Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nThis seems to swap the counts. My calculation had checkered red as 9, plain red as 3, which matches option D's checkered red as 1 and plain red as 9. That doesn't align with my earlier conclusion. Hmm, confusion arises. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the answer is option E, but why?\n\nWait, in the options, option E states:\n\nCheckered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\n\nIf I follow the same logic, then checkered red corresponds to Phenotype D (plain and checkered), which in my calculation was 1. But option E says checkered red is 3. That discrepancy suggests I may have misapplied the calculations. Let me try constructing a Punnett square properly. \n\nThe F2 generation comes from a cross of F1 (CcBb) x (ccbb). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 bb)\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Checkered red (from the question)\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Plain red\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Plain checkered\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% of CC \u2192 1 unit\n- Plain red: 25% of Cc \u2192 1 unit\n- Plain checkered: 25% of cc \u2192 1 unit\n- Plain brown: 25% of bb \u2192 1 unit\n\nBut since the question asks for the ratio in terms of the options, and none of the options seem to fit, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the F2 to include all possible combinations without considering dominance beyond the basic Mendelian ratios. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and should refer back to the standard F2 ratio for two loci, which is 9:3:3:1, leading to 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered. But none of the options match this exactly, except for option E, which lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio after considering dominance. For example, if the phenotypes are ordered as:\n\n1. Both traits present (red and brown) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigment red, body checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. Pigment checkered, body brown \u2192 plain brown\n4. Pigment checkered, body checkered \u2192 plain checkered\n\nIn this case, the counts would be 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered. Again, none of the options match this exactly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\n\nThis seems to suggest that checkered red is 3 and checkered brown is 9, which doesn't fit our calculation of 9 checkered red. Maybe the question is phrased incorrectly, or I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to a dihybrid cross instead of a test cross. Let me recast the problem.\n\nIf the cross is a dihybrid cross (e.g., F1 \u00d7 F1), the F2 would have 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. But in this case, the cross is a test cross (F1 \u00d7 F1), so the F2 would still reflect the 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the correct phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which maps to checkered red : plain red : plain brown : plain checkered. Which would translate to 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, 1 plain checkered. However, none of the options provided seem to match this exactly. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\n- Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n- Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n- Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n- Option K: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n- Option L: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n- Option M: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\n- Option N: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n- Option O: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n- Option P: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n- Option Q: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n- Option R: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n- Option S: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n- Option T: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n- Option U: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n- Option V: checkered red 9, checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 9\n\nWait, now I notice that option U is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This fits our calculation perfectly: 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, 1 plain checkered. However, none of the options seem to list this. Wait, looking back at the original options provided:\n\nOptions were:\n\nA.

Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 1, plain red 3, plain brown 9\n\nLooking back, option U states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This matches our calculation of 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, and 1 plain checkered. However, looking at the options, option U is the only one that mentions checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which seems inconsistent because the correct order should place checkered red before plain red, followed by plain brown, etc. But according to our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. So the correct option is not listed among the choices, but the closest one matching our calculation is option U.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Option E states the numbers as 3:9:1:3, which aligns with our calculation.",
    "rollout": " Option E states the numbers as 3:9:1:3, which aligns with our calculation. Let me verify once more: Phenotype A (both traits present): 9/16 of the population\nPhenotype B (only C): 3/16\nPhenotype C (only B): 3/16\nPhenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nSo the ratios would be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, that's the reverse of what I calculated. Did I make a mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, no. Because in my calculation, Phenotype A is both traits present, which is red and brown, so that's checkered red. Phenotype B is only C present, which is red and plain, so checkered brown. Similarly, Phenotype C is only B present, which is plain and brown, checkered red. And Phenotype D is neither, plain and plain, checkered black? Wait, no\u2014wait, in the problem statement, the third trait was the body color, which was determined by the B gene. So if a bird is plain (c) and brown (B), it's checkered red. If it's plain (c) and checkered (b), it's plain black. Wait, no, the problem states:\n\nRed color is determined by C; plain by c.\nBrown color is determined by B; checkered by b.\n\nWait, so the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So for body color:\n\n- Brown: B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- Checkered: b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these. So, in terms of the original options, checkered red is when both C and B are present (red and brown). Checkered brown is when C is present and B is absent (red and plain). Plain red is when C is absent and B is present (plain and brown). Plain brown is when C is absent and B is also absent (plain and checkered).\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me re-express:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 always present\n- Pigment plain (c)\n\n- Body color brown (B) \u2192 always present\n- Body color plain (b)\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes based on these are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body color brown (B) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body color plain (b) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body color brown (B) \u2192 plain red\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body color plain (b) \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, according to our earlier calculations, the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nSo the ratios would be 9:3:3:1. But in the options, none seem to exactly match this. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. Doesn\u2019t fit.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Hmm, 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown. Doesn't match.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches our calculation perfectly.\n\nD. 2,6,3,9 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, opposite of what we have.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount the probabilities. The F2 generation has 16 possible combinations, but many will lead to the same phenotype due to independent assortment. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. The probabilities should add up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which states the ratios as 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which matches our calculation.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Option E states the numbers as 3:9:1:3, which aligns with our calculation. Let me verify once more: Phenotype A (both traits present): 9/16 of the population\nPhenotype B (only C): 3/16\nPhenotype C (only B): 3/16\nPhenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nSo the ratios would be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, that's the reverse of what I calculated. Did I make a mistake?\n\nAh! Wait, no. Because in my calculation, Phenotype A is both traits present, which is red and brown, so that's checkered red. Phenotype B is only C present, which is red and plain, so checkered brown. Similarly, Phenotype C is only B present, which is plain and brown, checkered red. And Phenotype D is neither, plain and plain, checkered black? Wait, no\u2014wait, in the problem statement, the third trait was the body color, which was determined by the B gene. So if a bird is plain (c) and brown (B), it's checkered red. If it's plain (c) and checkered (b), it's plain black. Wait, no, the problem states:\n\nRed color is determined by C; plain by c.\nBrown color is determined by B; checkered by b.\n\nWait, so the presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So for body color:\n\n- Brown: B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- Checkered: b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these. So, in terms of the original options, checkered red is when both C and B are present (red and brown). Checkered brown is when C is present and B is absent (red and plain). Plain red is when C is absent and B is present (plain and brown). Plain brown is when C is absent and B is also absent (plain and checkered).\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me re-express:\n\n- Pigment red (C) \u2192 always present\n- Pigment plain (c)\n\n- Body color brown (B) \u2192 always present\n- Body color plain (b)\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes based on these are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body color brown (B) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body color plain (b) \u2192 checkered brown\n3. Pigment plain (c) and body color brown (B) \u2192 plain red\n4. Pigment plain (c) and body color plain (b) \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, according to our earlier calculations, the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nSo the ratios would be 9:3:3:1. But in the options, none seem to exactly match this. Let me look again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. Doesn\u2019t fit.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Hmm, 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown. Doesn't match.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches our calculation perfectly.\n\nD. 2,6,3,9 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Again, opposite of what we have.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount the probabilities. The F2 generation has 16 possible combinations, but many will lead to the same phenotype due to independent assortment. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. The probabilities should add up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which states the ratios as 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to phenotype D, which is 1 part, and checkered brown is B (3 parts), plain red is C (3 parts), plain brown is A (9 parts). Wait, but the options don't seem to align exactly with this. Let me double-check. The options are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, based on my earlier calculation, the counts should be roughly 1:3:3:9. But looking at option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's different. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, matching the 1:3:3:9 ratio. So option E matches the probabilities: 1 part plain red, 3 parts plain brown, 3 parts checkered brown, 9 parts checkered red. So the F2 phenotypic ratio is plain red : plain brown : checkered brown : checkered red = 3 : 9 : 3 : 9, but the options provided have different numbers. Option E states plain red 3, plain brown 9, checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, which is 3:9:3:9, which is equivalent to the ratio 1:3:3:9 when normalized by dividing by 3. Therefore, option E reflects the correct ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems inconsistent with our calculation because according to our calculation, checkered is B, so checkered would correspond to Phenotype C, which is 3 parts, and plain is Phenotype D, 1 part. Wait, let me double-check the definitions:\n\nWait, I may have confused the letters earlier. Let me clarify the letters:\n\n- Checkered: b (recessive for B)\n- Plain: c (recessive for C)\n- Pigmented red: C (dominant for C)\n- Pigmented brown: B (dominant for B)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype A: Pigmented red and brown (C and B present)\n- Phenotype B: Pigmented red and checkered (C present, B absent)\n- Phenotype C: Plain and brown (c and B present)\n- Phenotype D: Plain and checkered (c and B absent)\n\nTherefore, the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16 of the population\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nIf we assume a population of 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- 9 checkered-red-brown (A)\n- 3 checkered-red-checkered (B)\n- 3 plain-brown (C)\n- 1 plain-checkered (D)\n\nLooking back at the answer choices, option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". That doesn't match our 9,3,3,1 distribution. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\", which sums to 16, matching the total. But our calculations don't support this. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the F2 generation refers to the entire population after several generations, not just the offspring. But the question asks for the F2 generation, which typically refers to the second generation of breeding, i.e., the offspring of F1 and F1. Our calculation shows that in F2, 9/16 are Phenotype A, 3/16 Phenotype B, etc. So the actual numbers would depend on the size of the population. However, none of the answer choices seem to reflect this exact distribution. \n\nWait, looking back at the answer options, option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\". That also doesn't match our 9,3,3,1 distribution. Option I says \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". Again, different numbers. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". This aligns with our count if the population was small, but it's not scaled. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". This matches our 9,3,3,1 distribution exactly, assuming a population of 16 birds. Therefore, option E correctly reflects the expected phenotypic ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

    "rollout": " Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. The F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following probabilities:\n\nFor each gene:\n- C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered (c and b): All individuals without at least one dominant allele for either gene. So that's cc and bb. Probabilities:\n  - cc (25% Cc) * bb (25% Bb) = 6.25%\n  - cc (25% Cc) * bb (25% Bb) = 6.25% (Wait, no\u2014actually, the combined probabilities for cc and bb are (25% cc) * (25% bb) + (25% cc) * (25% bb) )? No, wait\u2014the correct way is to consider all combinations where either C is recessive or B is recessive. So the probability of checkered is (probability of cc) + (probability of bb) - (probability of both cc and bb). Because cc and bb overlap. So:\n\nProbability of checkered = (25% cc) * (25% bb) + (25% cc) * (25% bb) + (25% cc) * (25% bb) )?\n\nWait, no\u2014more accurately, the checkered phenotype occurs when neither C nor B is dominant, i.e., both alleles are recessive. So:\n\n- For C: 25% cc\n- For B: 25% bb\nThus, the probability of both cc and bb is (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25%. But also, the probability of cc OR bb is calculated as P(cc) + P(bb) - P(cc and bb) = 6.25% + 6.25% - 6.25% = 6.25%.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because if you have cc or bb, it's equivalent to checkered. So the total percentage for checkered is 6.25%, and similarly, for checkered brown (C present, b absent), it's the probability that C is present and B is absent.\n\nSo:\n\n- C present: 75% (3/4)\n- B absent: 75% (3/4)\n\nBut since C and B are independent, the probability of C present AND B absent is (75% * 25%) = 18.75%.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of B present AND C absent is (25% * 75%) = 18.75%.\n\nAnd the probability of neither is (25% * 25%) = 6.25%.\n\nAdding them up: 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 43.75%, which is almost 3/7, but that contradicts the previous statement. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. The probability that a bird has at least one dominant allele for C is 75%, and similarly for B. But the presence of dominant alleles for both genes together determines the phenotype. Let me construct a table:\n\nPhenotype | C present | B present | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCheckered (c and b) | No | No | (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25%\nPlain (c) and brown (B) | Yes | No | (75% C) * (25% bb) = 18.75%\nCheckered (c) and plain (B) | No | Yes | (25% cc) * (75% B) = 18.75%\nBoth (C and B) | Yes | Yes | (75% C) * (75% B) = 56.25%\n\nNow, adding up these probabilities: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%. So now, converting these percentages into numbers assuming a certain number of offspring, say N=100 birds:\n\n- Checkered (c and b): 6.25 birds\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): 18.75 birds\n- Checkered (c) and plain (B): 18.75 birds\n- Both (C and B): 56.25 birds\n\nLooking back at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No. Option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That matches exactly! Because 6.25 \u2248 4, 18.75\u22485, but none of the options have exact decimal equivalents. However, looking closely, option F uses whole numbers, rounding 6.25 to 4, 18.75 to 19, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong about the F2 generation. Maybe I messed up the Punnett square construction. Another possibility is that the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios were calculated incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and count all possible phenotypes, treating each bird as having a 25% chance for each genotype, leading to four phenotypes with equal likelihood. But that's not standard practice. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that only the dominant phenotypes are counted, but that's not stated. Alternatively, I might have misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine that. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C (i.e., C is present), it's red.\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for B (i.e., B is present), it's brown.\n- If a bird has neither dominant alleles for C nor B, it's plain-red and plain-brown (checkered).\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. Only C present \u2192 red and checkered\n3. Only B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n1. Both present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Only C: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Only B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Neither: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 \u2192 Correct.\n\nNow, translating these into counts assuming, say, 160 offspring (to make division easier):\n\n- Both: 9 parts \u2192 9/16 * 160 = 90\n- Only C: 3 \u2192 30\n- Only B: 3 \u2192 30\n- Neither: 1 \u2192 10\n\nBut none of the options match this. However, looking at the options, option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which sums to 16, implying equal distribution. This would correspond to each phenotype having 25% probability, which doesn't align with our calculations unless dominance is ignored. Perhaps the question simplifies the dominance rules by assuming that any dominant allele results in the dominant phenotype, regardless of the other gene. In that case, each bird would have one dominant phenotype, ignoring the other. So:\n\nEach bird would have either red (C), brown (B), or checkered (none). The probabilities would be:\n\n- Red: 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Brown: 3/4 (since B is dominant)\n- Checkered: 1/4 (both C and B recessive)\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratios would be approximately equal among the three categories, giving a 1:1:1 ratio. But that still doesn't explain the options given. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to treat each gene separately and calculate the phenotypic ratios based on dominance without considering the other gene, leading to a 1:1:1 ratio. But none of the options reflect a 1:1:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the expected phenotypic ratio under Mendelian inheritance, considering the independent segregation of the two genes. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of dominant and recessive traits. As calculated earlier, the probabilities would be:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only C present: 3/16\n- Only B present: 3/16\n- Neither present: 1/16\n\nIf we assume a population size of 16, the counts would be:\n\n- Both: 9\n- Only C: 3\n- Only B: 3\n- Neither: 1\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 9:3:3:1. But this doesn't match any of the options provided. \n\nLooking back at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Adding these up: 2+6+3+1=12, which is less than 16. So perhaps the question is expecting a simplified ratio, such as 1:1:1:1, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question's requirements. Maybe the question wants the phenotypic ratio based on dominance, treating each gene independently and counting only the dominant phenotypes, leading to a 1:1:1 ratio. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be equal for all three categories, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is supposed to consider only the presence of one dominant allele, ignoring the other gene, leading to a 2:2 ratio. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio for each gene individually, not considering the combination. For instance, for the C gene, the phenotypic ratio would be red : plain = 3:1, and for the B gene, brown : plain = 3:1. Combining these would give a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which again doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio based on dominance alone, ignoring the other gene. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C, it's red, and similarly for B. Ignoring the interaction between the two, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:3:1 (red, brown, checkered), but that doesn't fit the options either.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that the options provided do not include the 1:1:1:1 ratio, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio for F2, so perhaps it's considering only the dominant phenotypes. In that case, each bird would have one dominant phenotype, ignoring the other. So the phenotypes would be red, brown, and checkered, each with a 1:1:1 ratio. However, the options don't have such a choice. \n\nWait, going back to the initial approach, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of the dominant allele in each gene, leading to four phenotypes, with probabilities 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16. If we round these to the nearest whole number, we get 9, 3, 3, 1. Summing these gives 16, which corresponds to 16 birds. However, the options provided don't have 9:3:3:1 as an option, but option F is 4:4:4:4, which would imply equal distribution across all four phenotypes, which isn't the case here. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me verify:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly, but let me look at the closest ones. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which would suggest each phenotype has 25%, which doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which adds up to 12, not 16. Option K is 8:4:0:4, which doesn't add up to 16. Option L is 3:3:2:6, which also adds to 14. Option M is 5:5:3:2, totaling 15. Option N is 7:5:3:1, totaling 16. Option O is 3:3:1:3, which adds to 10. Option P is 4:4:4:4, which adds to 16. Option Q is 6:2:6:2, totaling 16. Option R is 8:1:2:2, totaling 13. Option S is 5:3:2:9, totaling 19. Option T is 3:2:9:3, totaling 17. Option U is 1:1:3:9, totaling 14. Option V is 2:2:6:2, totaling 12. Option W is 5:3:2:6, totaling 16. Option X is 3:3:1:9, totaling 16. Option Y is 6:6:1:5, totaling 18. Option Z is 9:1:3:3, totaling 16.\n\nSo, only options W, X, Y, and Z sum to 16. Among these, option W is 5:3:2:9, which doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option X is 3:3:1:9, which also doesn't match. Option Y is 6:6:1:5, which is 6:6:1:5, which doesn't align with 9:3:3:1. Option Z is 9:1:3:3, which is close but not exact. Option W is 5:3:2:9, which is closer to 9:3:3:1 but adjusted. \n\nHowever, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of one dominant allele, ignoring the other gene, leading to a 1:1:1 ratio for each phenotype. If that's the case, then each phenotype would occur equally, making the ratio 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the ratio based on dominance, treating each gene independently but only considering the presence of at least one dominant allele, leading to a 2:2 ratio for each gene, resulting in a 1:1 ratio overall. But none of the options reflect that.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider. The question is asking for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. If each bird's phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, then:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown (phenotype A)\n- Only C present \u2192 red and checkered (phenotype B)\n- Only B present \u2192 plain and brown (phenotype C)\n- Neither present \u2192 plain and checkered (phenotype D)\n\nWith probabilities:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nIf we round these to the nearest whole number, we'd have 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match any option exactly. However, option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12. Option W is 5:3:2:9, which sums to 19. Option X is 3:3:1:9, which is 16, but not matching 9:3:3:1. Option Y is 6:6:1:5, which sums to 18. Option Z is 9:1:3:3, which sums to 16 but is 9:1:3:3, not 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the interaction between the two genes and simply count the dominant traits, leading to a 2:2 ratio for each gene, hence a 1:1 ratio overall. If each bird has a 50% chance of being red or brown, and 50% chance of being plain or checkered, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, if we consider dominance in each gene separately, each gene would lead to a 1:1 ratio, but combined, it might lead to a different outcome. \n\nUpon reflection, I think the intended answer is option J, which states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This would mean that the checkered phenotype (both C and B) appears twice as often as the others. However, according to our calculations, the checkered phenotype should appear 9/16 of the time, while the others are 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16. Rounded to the nearest whole number, this would be 9:3:3:1, which isn't reflected in any option. Therefore, perhaps the correct",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. The F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following probabilities:\n\nFor each gene:\n- C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered (c and b): All individuals without at least one dominant allele for either gene. So that's cc and bb. Probabilities:\n  - cc (25% Cc) * bb (25% Bb) = 6.25%\n  - cc (25% Cc) * bb (25% Bb) = 6.25% (Wait, no\u2014actually, the combined probabilities for cc and bb are (25% cc) * (25% bb) + (25% cc) * (25% bb) )? No, wait\u2014the correct way is to consider all combinations where either C is recessive or B is recessive. So the probability of checkered is (probability of cc) + (probability of bb) - (probability of both cc and bb). Because cc and bb overlap. So:\n\nProbability of checkered = (25% cc) * (25% bb) + (25% cc) * (25% bb) + (25% cc) * (25% bb) )?\n\nWait, no\u2014more accurately, the checkered phenotype occurs when neither C nor B is dominant, i.e., both alleles are recessive. So:\n\n- For C: 25% cc\n- For B: 25% bb\nThus, the probability of both cc and bb is (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25%. But also, the probability of cc OR bb is calculated as P(cc) + P(bb) - P(cc and bb) = 6.25% + 6.25% - 6.25% = 6.25%.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because if you have cc or bb, it's equivalent to checkered. So the total percentage for checkered is 6.25%, and similarly, for checkered brown (C present, b absent), it's the probability that C is present and B is absent.\n\nSo:\n\n- C present: 75% (3/4)\n- B absent: 75% (3/4)\n\nBut since C and B are independent, the probability of C present AND B absent is (75% * 25%) = 18.75%.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of B present AND C absent is (25% * 75%) = 18.75%.\n\nAnd the probability of neither is (25% * 25%) = 6.25%.\n\nAdding them up: 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 43.75%, which is almost 3/7, but that contradicts the previous statement. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach. The probability that a bird has at least one dominant allele for C is 75%, and similarly for B. But the presence of dominant alleles for both genes together determines the phenotype. Let me construct a table:\n\nPhenotype | C present | B present | Probability\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCheckered (c and b) | No | No | (25% cc) * (25% bb) = 6.25%\nPlain (c) and brown (B) | Yes | No | (75% C) * (25% bb) = 18.75%\nCheckered (c) and plain (B) | No | Yes | (25% cc) * (75% B) = 18.75%\nBoth (C and B) | Yes | Yes | (75% C) * (75% B) = 56.25%\n\nNow, adding up these probabilities: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%. So now, converting these percentages into numbers assuming a certain number of offspring, say N=100 birds:\n\n- Checkered (c and b): 6.25 birds\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): 18.75 birds\n- Checkered (c) and plain (B): 18.75 birds\n- Both (C and B): 56.25 birds\n\nLooking back at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. No. Option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That matches exactly! Because 6.25 \u2248 4, 18.75\u22485, but none of the options have exact decimal equivalents. However, looking closely, option F uses whole numbers, rounding 6.25 to 4, 18.75 to 19, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong about the F2 generation. Maybe I messed up the Punnett square construction. Another possibility is that the F2 generation's phenotypic ratios were calculated incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore dominance and count all possible phenotypes, treating each bird as having a 25% chance for each genotype, leading to four phenotypes with equal likelihood. But that's not standard practice. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that only the dominant phenotypes are counted, but that's not stated. Alternatively, I might have misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine that. Each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for C (i.e., C is present), it's red.\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for B (i.e., B is present), it's brown.\n- If a bird has neither dominant alleles for C nor B, it's plain-red and plain-brown (checkered).\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. Only C present \u2192 red and checkered\n3. Only B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n1. Both present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Only C: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Only B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Neither: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 \u2192 Correct.\n\nNow, translating these into counts assuming, say, 160 offspring (to make division easier):\n\n- Both: 9 parts \u2192 9/16 * 160 = 90\n- Only C: 3 \u2192 30\n- Only B: 3 \u2192 30\n- Neither: 1 \u2192 10\n\nBut none of the options match this. However, looking at the options, option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which sums to 16, implying equal distribution. This would correspond to each phenotype having 25% probability, which doesn't align with our calculations unless dominance is ignored. Perhaps the question simplifies the dominance rules by assuming that any dominant allele results in the dominant phenotype, regardless of the other gene. In that case, each bird would have one dominant phenotype, ignoring the other. So:\n\nEach bird would have either red (C), brown (B), or checkered (none). The probabilities would be:\n\n- Red: 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Brown: 3/4 (since B is dominant)\n- Checkered: 1/4 (both C and B recessive)\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratios would be approximately equal among the three categories, giving a 1:1:1 ratio. But that still doesn't explain the options given. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to treat each gene separately and calculate the phenotypic ratios based on dominance without considering the other gene, leading to a 1:1:1 ratio. But none of the options reflect a 1:1:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the expected phenotypic ratio under Mendelian inheritance, considering the independent segregation of the two genes. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of dominant and recessive traits. As calculated earlier, the probabilities would be:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only C present: 3/16\n- Only B present: 3/16\n- Neither present: 1/16\n\nIf we assume a population size of 16, the counts would be:\n\n- Both: 9\n- Only C: 3\n- Only B: 3\n- Neither: 1\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 9:3:3:1. But this doesn't match any of the options provided. \n\nLooking back at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Adding these up: 2+6+3+1=12, which is less than 16. So perhaps the question is expecting a simplified ratio, such as 1:1:1:1, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the question's requirements. Maybe the question wants the phenotypic ratio based on dominance, treating each gene independently and counting only the dominant phenotypes, leading to a 1:1:1 ratio. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be equal for all three categories, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is supposed to consider only the presence of one dominant allele, ignoring the other gene, leading to a 2:2 ratio. But again, none of the options match this.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question refers to the phenotypic ratio for each gene individually, not considering the combination. For instance, for the C gene, the phenotypic ratio would be red : plain = 3:1, and for the B gene, brown : plain = 3:1. Combining these would give a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which again doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the phenotypic ratio based on dominance alone, ignoring the other gene. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C, it's red, and similarly for B. Ignoring the interaction between the two, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:3:1 (red, brown, checkered), but that doesn't fit the options either.\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that the options provided do not include the 1:1:1:1 ratio, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio for F2, so perhaps it's considering only the dominant phenotypes. In that case, each bird would have one dominant phenotype, ignoring the other. So the phenotypes would be red, brown, and checkered, each with a 1:1:1 ratio. However, the options don't have such a choice. \n\nWait, going back to the initial approach, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of the dominant allele in each gene, leading to four phenotypes, with probabilities 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16. If we round these to the nearest whole number, we get 9, 3, 3, 1. Summing these gives 16, which corresponds to 16 birds. However, the options provided don't have 9:3:3:1 as an option, but option F is 4:4:4:4, which would imply equal distribution across all four phenotypes, which isn't the case here. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me verify:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this exactly, but let me look at the closest ones. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which would suggest each phenotype has 25%, which doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which adds up to 12, not 16. Option K is 8:4:0:4, which doesn't add up to 16. Option L is 3:3:2:6, which also adds to 14. Option M is 5:5:3:2, totaling 15. Option N is 7:5:3:1, totaling 16. Option O is 3:3:1:3, which adds to 10. Option P is 4:4:4:4, which adds to 16. Option Q is 6:2:6:2, totaling 16. Option R is 8:1:2:2, totaling 13. Option S is 5:3:2:9, totaling 19. Option T is 3:2:9:3, totaling 17. Option U is 1:1:3:9, totaling 14. Option V is 2:2:6:2, totaling 12. Option W is 5:3:2:6, totaling 16. Option X is 3:3:1:9, totaling 16. Option Y is 6:6:1:5, totaling 18. Option Z is 9:1:3:3, totaling 16.\n\nSo, only options W, X, Y, and Z sum to 16. Among these, option W is 5:3:2:9, which doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option X is 3:3:1:9, which also doesn't match. Option Y is 6:6:1:5, which is 6:6:1:5, which doesn't align with 9:3:3:1. Option Z is 9:1:3:3, which is close but not exact. Option W is 5:3:2:9, which is closer to 9:3:3:1 but adjusted. \n\nHowever, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of one dominant allele, ignoring the other gene, leading to a 1:1:1 ratio for each phenotype. If that's the case, then each phenotype would occur equally, making the ratio 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in any of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the ratio based on dominance, treating each gene independently but only considering the presence of at least one dominant allele, leading to a 2:2 ratio for each gene, resulting in a 1:1 ratio overall. But none of the options reflect that.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider. The question is asking for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. If each bird's phenotype is determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, then:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown (phenotype A)\n- Only C present \u2192 red and checkered (phenotype B)\n- Only B present \u2192 plain and brown (phenotype C)\n- Neither present \u2192 plain and checkered (phenotype D)\n\nWith probabilities:\n\n- A: 9/16\n- B: 3/16\n- C: 3/16\n- D: 1/16\n\nIf we round these to the nearest whole number, we'd have 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match any option exactly. However, option J is 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12. Option W is 5:3:2:9, which sums to 19. Option X is 3:3:1:9, which is 16, but not matching 9:3:3:1. Option Y is 6:6:1:5, which sums to 18. Option Z is 9:1:3:3, which sums to 16 but is 9:1:3:3, not 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting us to ignore the interaction between the two genes and simply count the dominant traits, leading to a 2:2 ratio for each gene, hence a 1:1 ratio overall. If each bird has a 50% chance of being red or brown, and 50% chance of being plain or checkered, then the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, if we consider dominance in each gene separately, each gene would lead to a 1:1 ratio, but combined, it might lead to a different outcome. \n\nUpon reflection, I think the intended answer is option J, which states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This would mean that the checkered phenotype (both C and B) appears twice as often as the others. However, according to our calculations, the checkered phenotype should appear 9/16 of the time, while the others are 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16. Rounded to the nearest whole number, this would be 9:3:3:1, which isn't reflected in any option. Therefore, perhaps the correct",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered (plain) is phenotype D, which is 1 part, and plain red (phenotype C) is 3 parts. But in our earlier analysis, phenotype C was plain and brown (without C) and phenotype D was plain and checkered (without B). Wait, let me double-check. Wait, in my earlier breakdown, phenotype A is both red and brown (C and B present), phenotype B is red and checkered (C present, B absent), phenotype C is plain and brown (C absent, B present), and phenotype D is plain and checkered (C and B absent). So according to the calculations, the number of birds would be:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nSo, if the total is 16 parts, then the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered red (A): 9\n- Checkered brown (B): 3\n- Plain brown (C): 3\n- Plain checkered (D): 1\n\nWhich matches option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But according to our calculation, checkered red (A) is 9, checkered brown (B) is 3, plain brown (C) is 3, and plain checkered (D) is 1. So the numbers would be 9, 3, 3, 1. Which corresponds to option E. However, looking back at the options, option E states: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Yes, that matches exactly what we've got.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's exactly what I got.

Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "That corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown) as 3 parts, Phenotype A (red and brown) as 9 parts, Phenotype B (red and plain) as 3 parts, and Phenotype D (plain and plain) as 1 part.",

Wait, but according to our calculations, Phenotype A is red and brown (phenotype 1), which is 9/16, Phenotype B is red and plain (phenotype 2), 3/16, Phenotype C is plain and brown (phenotype 3), 3/16, and Phenotype D is plain and plain (phenotype 4), 1/16. So the order of phenotypes in terms of occurrence is A, B, C, D. But looking at the answer choices, the options list phenotypes without specifying the order. Let me look at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2013 Doesn't match our calculation.\n\nB.

Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2013 This matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio, but wait, our calculation was 9:3:3:1, but in the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, leading to four possible phenotypes. However, the user's options don't seem to reflect the exact 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nLet me double-check the probabilities. For the C locus: 3/4 chance of being C (present), 1/4 chance of being cc (plain). For the B locus: 3/4 chance of being B (present), 1/4 chance of being bb (checkered). Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B present): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B (C present, B absent): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C (C absent, B present): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D (Neither C nor B present): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which sums to 16. Therefore, the proportion of each phenotype is 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16. Now, applying this to the answer options, none of them exactly match 9:3:3:1, but option C lists 9, 3, 3, 1. However, looking at the options again, perhaps I misread the letters. Option C is Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't align with our earlier breakdown. According to our analysis, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9, Phenotype B (red and plain) is 3, Phenotype C (plain and brown) is 3, and Phenotype D (plain and plain) is 1. So the correct order would be Phenotype A, B, C, D. But the answer options list the phenotypes in a different order. Wait, perhaps the user labeled the phenotypes incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the order of the letters. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nIf the phenotypes are ordered as A, B, C, D, then this would correspond to 9, 3, 3, 1. Which matches our calculation. So option C is 9:3:3:1, which fits. But wait, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio. The options provide specific numbers for each phenotype. So if the ratio is 9:3:3:1, and the total number of offspring is, say, 16, then the counts would be 9, 3, 3, 1. But none of the answer options explicitly state 9:3:3:1, but option C does. Alternatively, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement. Wait, the problem states the adihybrid cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the F2 generation would have a certain ratio. Another possibility is that I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me try constructing a Punnett square for the F2.\n\nThe parents are CcBB and ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CcBB and ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CcBB and ccbb. Wait, no\u2014each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CcBB, meaning for the C locus: Cc (dominant) and BB (dominant for B). The second parent is ccbb, meaning for the C locus: cc (recessive) and bb (recessive for B).\n\nWhen these two parents mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb because each parent contributes Cc and BB for the C locus, and for the B locus, each contributes Bb and bb. Wait, no\u2014each parent's gametes for the C locus would be C and c, and for the B locus would be B and b. So F1 would be CcBB (for the first gene) and cbbb (which doesn't make sense, probably a typo)\u2014Wait, no. Wait, the parents are CcBB and ccbb. So for the C locus, the parents are Cc and cc. Mating these would produce Cc (because Cc \u00d7 cc produces Cc with 50% C and 50% c). Similarly, for the B locus, parents are BB and bb. Mating these would produce Bb (since BB \u00d7 bb produces Bb with 50% B and 50% b). So the F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 would have the following genotypes based on independent assortment:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes include all combinations of these. The phenotypes depend on whether C and/or B are present. So the phenotypic ratios would be as follows:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\n- CC BB: red, brown ( phenotype A )\n- CC Bb: red, brown ( phenotype A )\n- CC bb: red, checkered ( phenotype A )\n- CC bb: red, checkered ( phenotype A )\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Cc BB: red, brown ( phenotype A )\n- Cc Bb: red, brown ( phenotype A )\n- Cc bb: red, checkered ( phenotype A )\n\nAnd so on. But since the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the actual count for each phenotype would be:\n\n- Phenotype A (C present and B present): All birds with at least one dominant allele in each gene. The probability is 9/16.\n\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): 3/16\n\n- Phenotype C (C absent, B present): 3/16\n\n- Phenotype D (Neither present): 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So among the options, option C states Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our ratio, so option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown) as 3 parts, Phenotype A (red and brown) as 9 parts, Phenotype B (red and plain) as 3 parts, and Phenotype D (plain and plain) as 1 part. Wait, but according to our calculations, Phenotype A is red and brown (phenotype 1), which is 9/16, Phenotype B is red and plain (phenotype 2), 3/16, Phenotype C is plain and brown (phenotype 3), 3/16, and Phenotype D is plain and plain (phenotype 4), 1/16. So the order of phenotypes in terms of occurrence is A, B, C, D. But looking at the answer choices, the options list phenotypes without specifying the order. Let me look at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2013 Doesn't match our calculation.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2013 Also doesn't fit.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2013 This matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio, but wait, our calculation was 9:3:3:1, but in the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, leading to four possible phenotypes. However, the user's options don't seem to reflect the exact 9:3:3:1 ratio. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nLet me double-check the probabilities. For the C locus: 3/4 chance of being C (present), 1/4 chance of being cc (plain). For the B locus: 3/4 chance of being B (present), 1/4 chance of being bb (checkered). Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nPhenotype A (C and B present): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype B (C present, B absent): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype C (C absent, B present): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype D (Neither C nor B present): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which sums to 16. Therefore, the proportion of each phenotype is 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, and 1/16. Now, applying this to the answer options, none of them exactly match 9:3:3:1, but option C lists 9, 3, 3, 1. However, looking at the options again, perhaps I misread the letters. Option C is Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't align with our earlier breakdown. According to our analysis, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9, Phenotype B (red and plain) is 3, Phenotype C (plain and brown) is 3, and Phenotype D (plain and plain) is 1.

The second parent is ccbb, meaning for the C locus: cc (recessive) and bb (recessive for B).\n\nWhen these two parents mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb because each parent contributes Cc and BB for the C locus, and for the B locus, each contributes Bb and bb. Wait, no\u2014each parent's gametes for the C locus would be C and c, and for the B locus would be B and b. So F1 would be CcBB (for the first gene) and cbbb (which doesn't make sense, probably a typo)\u2014Wait, no. Wait, the parents are CcBB and ccbb. So for the C locus, the parents are Cc and cc. Mating these would produce Cc (because Cc \u00d7 cc produces Cc with 50% C and 50% c). Similarly, for the B locus, parents are BB and bb. Mating these would produce Bb (since BB \u00d7 bb produces Bb with 50% B and 50% b). So the F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 would have the following genotypes based on independent assortment:\n\nFor the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n\nFor the B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes include all combinations of these. The phenotypes depend on whether C and/or B are present. So the phenotypic ratios would be as follows:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\n- CC BB: red, brown ( phenotype A )\n- CC Bb: red, brown ( phenotype A )\n- CC bb: red, checkered ( phenotype A )\n- CC bb: red, checkered ( phenotype A )\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Cc BB: red, brown ( phenotype A )\n- Cc Bb: red, brown ( phenotype A )\n- Cc bb: red, checkered ( phenotype A )\n\nAnd so on. But since the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the actual count for each phenotype would be:\n\n- Phenotype A (C present and B present): All birds with at least one dominant allele in each gene. The probability is 9/16.\n\n- Phenotype B (C present, B absent): 3/16\n\n- Phenotype C (C absent, B present): 3/16\n\n- Phenotype D (Neither present): 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. So among the options, option C states Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our ratio, so option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D, which is 1 part, but in the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, etc.",
    "rollout": " Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D, which is 1 part, but in the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check the definitions. The problem states: Checkered is controlled by the recessive allele c, so the presence of c results in checkering. Brown is controlled by the dominant allele B, so presence of B results in brown. Pigment color is determined by C, dominant color is red, recessive is plain. So:\n\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 body color is checkered\n- Brown (B) \u2192 body color is brown\n- Pigmented (C) \u2192 red\n- Plain (c) \u2192 plain\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- Both C and B \u2192 red and brown (Phenotype 1)\n- C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Phenotype 2)\n- C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown (Phenotype 3)\n- Neither \u2192 plain and checkered (Phenotype 4)\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nIf we assume N offspring, then the numbers would be approximately:\n\n- 9N checkered red\n- 3N checkered brown\n- 3N plain red\n- 1N plain brown\n\nWhich matches option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is the last choice, so the answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype D, which is 1 part, but in the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check the definitions. The problem states: Checkered is controlled by the recessive allele c, so the presence of c results in checkering. Brown is controlled by the dominant allele B, so presence of B results in brown. Pigment color is determined by C, dominant color is red, recessive is plain. So:\n\n- Checkered (c) \u2192 body color is checkered\n- Brown (B) \u2192 body color is brown\n- Pigmented (C) \u2192 red\n- Plain (c) \u2192 plain\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits. So:\n\n- Both C and B \u2192 red and brown (Phenotype 1)\n- C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Phenotype 2)\n- C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown (Phenotype 3)\n- Neither \u2192 plain and checkered (Phenotype 4)\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype 1: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nIf we assume N offspring, then the numbers would be approximately:\n\n- 9N checkered red\n- 3N checkered brown\n- 3N plain red\n- 1N plain brown\n\nWhich matches option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is the last choice, so the answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, Phenotype A is 9, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But the options don't list this exactly. Let me look at the options:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, my calculation gave a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWait, but looking back, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Because in reality, the presence of C and B in each bird results in certain phenotypes. Let me double-check. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So, for each bird, if they have at least one dominant allele for C and one dominant allele for B, they will have both traits. Otherwise, they'll have only one trait or none. So, the exact probabilities are:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)^2=1/16\n\nThus, the ratio of Phenotypes is 9:3:3:1, which aligns with Option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, according to our calculation, checkered red would be phenotype B (only C): 3 parts, checkered brown (only B): 3 parts, plain red (neither): 1 part, plain brown (both traits): 9 parts. So the ratio would be 1:3:3:9. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. Which matches option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014option E lists them as 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But according to our calculations, checkered red is 3 parts, checkered brown is 3 parts, plain red is 1 part, and plain brown is 9 parts. So the order would be 1 (plain red) : 3 (checkered red) : 3 (checkered brown) : 9 (plain brown). So option E is plain red 3, checkered red 9, checkered brown 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014it's plain red (1), checkered red (3), checkered brown (3), plain brown (9). So the ratio is 1:3:3:9, which is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "That seems off because our calculations suggest that the majority of birds would have both traits (9/16), followed by only one trait (3/16 each), and none (1/16).",
    "rollout": " That seems off because our calculations suggest that the majority of birds would have both traits (9/16), followed by only one trait (3/16 each), and none (1/16). However, looking at the options, option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2, which sums to 18, but according to our calculation, it should be around 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but perhaps the options are simplified or rounded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the presence of one dominant allele per gene, leading to three phenotypes: red-brown, red-checkered, and plain-checkered, without considering both traits together. But that would change the probabilities significantly. Let me recalculate under this assumption. If each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, then:\n\nFor each trait, the presence of a dominant allele results in the trait being expressed. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present. Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent. Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\nPhenotype 3: B present, C absent. Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B present. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is approximately 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the answer options, none exactly match this, but option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, that's close but not matching. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, not matching. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which also doesn't fit. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio when scaled appropriately. Because 9:3:3:1 divided by 3 equals 3:1:1:1/3, but none of the options reflect this directly. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of each phenotype to the total population, but presented as whole numbers. If the total is 16, the counts would be 9, 3, 3, 1. But none of the options provide exact 9:3:3:1. The closest is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of the correct order. So perhaps the question is expecting the order to be checkedered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, but that doesn't align with our previous analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's reconsider. The problem states that the checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc bb), and the plain bird is homozygous dominant (CC BB). They mate, producing F1 (CC BB x cc bb), which results in all CcBb gametes. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 would include the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb x cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probabilities of each phenotype are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 2: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 3: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 4: 25% \u2192 1/4\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning all four phenotypes are equally likely. But that contradicts our earlier analysis where we considered the presence of dominant alleles leading to different phenotypes. This discrepancy arises because the problem statement may have intended that each trait is expressed independently, leading to four phenotypes each with equal likelihood. However, the answer options don't present such an option. \n\nLooking at the answer options, option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, not 16, so that's inconsistent. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16 and matches our initial 9:3:3:1 ratio when scaled down. So option E might be the intended answer, but the order is reversed compared to our analysis. However, the question asks for checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown. Our analysis shows that checkered red corresponds to ccBb (phenotype 4, plain), but in reality, phenotype 4 is plain and checkered. Wait, no, in our earlier breakdown, checkered is plain and checkered (phenotype 4), while plain is checkered and plain (phenotype 3). Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should re-express the phenotypes correctly.\n\nLet me redefine the phenotypes properly:\n\n- Checkered (C recessive, B recessive): Phenotype 4 (plain and checkered)\n- Plain (C recessive, B dominant): Phenotype 3 (plain and brown)\n- Checkered (C dominant, B recessive): Phenotype 4 (plain and checkered)\nWait, no\u2014that's double-counting. Each bird has two traits, so the correct definition should be:\n\n- Checkered (C recessive, B recessive): Phenotype 4\n- Plain (C recessive, B dominant): Phenotype 3\n- Checkered (C dominant, B recessive): Phenotype 4 (same as above)\n- Plain (C dominant, B dominant): Phenotype 1\n\nThis can't be right because each bird can only have one phenotype. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotype is determined by both. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nIn terms of dominance, each trait is expressed if at least one dominant allele is present. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: At least one C and at least one B \u2192 expressed\n- Phenotype 2: At least one C and at least one b \u2192 expressed\n- Phenotype 3: At least one c and at least one B \u2192 expressed\n- Phenotype 4: At least one c and at least one b \u2192 expressed\n\nTherefore, all four phenotypes are possible, depending on the alleles. Now, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: Only C present \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: Only B present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the answer options, none directly match this. However, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of our ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, but the correct sum should be 16. None of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the question expects the ratio in a different order or simplified. If we simplify 9:3:3:1 by dividing by 3, we get 3:1:1:1/3, which doesn't match any option. Alternatively, the question might be referring to the number of each phenotype relative to the total, not the fraction. If the total is 16, then:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9 \u2192 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3 \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3 \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1 \u2192 1/16\n\nBut none of the options represent this. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which would correspond to 3/16 : 9/16 : 1/16 : 3/16, which is the reverse of what we have. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, indicating 12/18 = 2/3, etc., which doesn't match our 9/16 ratio. Option H is 5:3:9:1, which is similar to our ratio but shifted. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't match. Option J is 2:6:3:9, which is again shifted. Option K is 4:4:4:4, which would imply equal distribution among four phenotypes, which isn't the case here.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the question assumes that each trait is expressed independently, leading to three phenotypes, each with a certain frequency. However, the standard genetic model accounts for four phenotypes with the ratio 9:3:3:1. Since none of the options match this precisely, I might have misunderstood the problem. Let me read the question again.\n\nAh! The question specifies \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is determined by C, and plain by c. But the problem is about the effect of the adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a homozygous plain brown (cc bb) parent. Their F1 (CcBb) will produce a certain distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the F2 phenotypes. Let me recount. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC, Cc, cc\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc, cc\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: cb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc, cc\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: bb \u2192 bb\n\nWait, no\u2014when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25%. So the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: cb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: bb (25%)\n\nBut when combined, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 25% (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- cc: 25% (from cb\u00d7cb) + 25% (from cb\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb) \u2192 50%\n- bb: 25% (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nNow, considering the phenotypes based on presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- bb: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: CC \u2192 25% (CC is 1/4 of the F2)\n- Phenotype B: Cc \u2192 50% (25% from CB\u00d7cb and 25% from cb\u00d7CB)\n- Phenotype C: cc \u2192 50% (25% from cb\u00d7cb and 25% from cb\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb)\n- Phenotype D: bb \u2192 25%\n\nBut wait, this doesn't add up because 25 + 50 + 50 + 25 = 150%, which is incorrect. I must have miscalculated the probabilities. Each F2 genotype comes from the combination of two F1 gametes. So the correct approach is to count the number of ways each genotype can occur:\n\n- CC: Can only come from CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 1 way\n- Cc: Can come from CB \u00d7 cb or cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 2 ways\n- cc: Can come from cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 1 way\n- bb: Can come from cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 1 way\n\nSince each parent contributes four gametes (two from each), the total number of possible F2 genotypes is 16 (4 \u00d7 4). Therefore:\n\n- CC: 1 (from CB\u00d7CB) \u2192 1/16\n- Cc: 2 (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- cc: 1 (from cb\u00d7cb) \u2192 1/16\n- bb: 1 (from cb\u00d7cb) \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, this is incorrect because each F2 genotype is formed by pairing two gametes, and each pair has four possibilities, but each gamete is half the possible combinations. Alternatively, the correct way is to realize that each F2 genotype has a certain probability based on the F1 gamete frequencies. Since F1 is CcBb, each gamete has a 25% chance for each of the four possible gametes (CB, cb, cB, cb). Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: cb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: bb (25%)\n\nHowever, when combining all possibilities, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC: 1/4 (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc: 2/4 (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- cc: 2/4 (from cb\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb)\n- bb: 1/4 (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nWait, this still doesn't add up correctly. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. CC: 1/16\n2. Cc: 4/16 (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n3. cc: 6/16 (from cb\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb)\n4. bb: 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The correct approach is to consider that each F2 genotype is formed by the combination of two F1 gametes. Since F1 is CcBb, each gamete has a 25% chance of being CB, cb, cB, or cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: cb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: bb (25%)\n\nNow, counting the number of ways each genotype can occur:\n\n- CC: 1 way (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc: 2 ways (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- cc: 4 ways (from cb\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb)\n- bb: 1 way (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nTotal ways: 8, but since each F2 individual is formed by pairing two gametes, the actual count is higher. Each F2 individual is a combination of two gametes, so there are 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 possible genotype combinations, each with equal probability (25% each).\n\nThus:\n\n- CC: Occurs when both gametes are CB \u2192 1 way \u2192 25%\n- Cc: Occurs when one gamete is CB and the other is cb \u2192 2 ways \u2192 50%\n- cc: Occurs when both gametes are cb or one is cb and the other is something else \u2192 4 ways \u2192 100%?\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let's instead recognize that when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, as each trait is segregating independently. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which translates to:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Pigment red and brown): 9 parts\n- Phenotype 2 (Pigment red and checkered): 3 parts\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and brown): 3 parts\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and checkered): 1 part\n\nIf the total number of individuals is N",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That seems off because our calculations suggest that the majority of birds would have both traits (9/16), followed by only one trait (3/16 each), and none (1/16). However, looking at the options, option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2, which sums to 18, but according to our calculation, it should be around 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly match this, but perhaps the options are simplified or rounded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the presence of one dominant allele per gene, leading to three phenotypes: red-brown, red-checkered, and plain-checkered, without considering both traits together. But that would change the probabilities significantly. Let me recalculate under this assumption. If each bird must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, then:\n\nFor each trait, the presence of a dominant allele results in the trait being expressed. So the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B): Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b): Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present. Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent. Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\nPhenotype 3: B present, C absent. Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B present. Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is approximately 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the answer options, none exactly match this, but option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, that's close but not matching. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, not matching. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which also doesn't fit. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio when scaled appropriately. Because 9:3:3:1 divided by 3 equals 3:1:1:1/3, but none of the options reflect this directly. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the ratio of each phenotype to the total population, but presented as whole numbers. If the total is 16, the counts would be 9, 3, 3, 1. But none of the options provide exact 9:3:3:1. The closest is option E, which is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of the correct order. So perhaps the question is expecting the order to be checkedered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, but that doesn't align with our previous analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's reconsider. The problem states that the checkered bird is homozygous recessive (cc bb), and the plain bird is homozygous dominant (CC BB). They mate, producing F1 (CC BB x cc bb), which results in all CcBb gametes. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The F2 would include the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb x cb)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe probabilities of each phenotype are as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 2: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 3: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- Phenotype 4: 25% \u2192 1/4\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, meaning all four phenotypes are equally likely. But that contradicts our earlier analysis where we considered the presence of dominant alleles leading to different phenotypes. This discrepancy arises because the problem statement may have intended that each trait is expressed independently, leading to four phenotypes each with equal likelihood. However, the answer options don't present such an option. \n\nLooking at the answer options, option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, not 16, so that's inconsistent. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16 and matches our initial 9:3:3:1 ratio when scaled down. So option E might be the intended answer, but the order is reversed compared to our analysis. However, the question asks for checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown. Our analysis shows that checkered red corresponds to ccBb (phenotype 4, plain), but in reality, phenotype 4 is plain and checkered. Wait, no, in our earlier breakdown, checkered is plain and checkered (phenotype 4), while plain is checkered and plain (phenotype 3). Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should re-express the phenotypes correctly.\n\nLet me redefine the phenotypes properly:\n\n- Checkered (C recessive, B recessive): Phenotype 4 (plain and checkered)\n- Plain (C recessive, B dominant): Phenotype 3 (plain and brown)\n- Checkered (C dominant, B recessive): Phenotype 4 (plain and checkered)\nWait, no\u2014that's double-counting. Each bird has two traits, so the correct definition should be:\n\n- Checkered (C recessive, B recessive): Phenotype 4\n- Plain (C recessive, B dominant): Phenotype 3\n- Checkered (C dominant, B recessive): Phenotype 4 (same as above)\n- Plain (C dominant, B dominant): Phenotype 1\n\nThis can't be right because each bird can only have one phenotype. Wait, no\u2014each bird has two traits, so the phenotype is determined by both. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nIn terms of dominance, each trait is expressed if at least one dominant allele is present. So:\n\n- Phenotype 1: At least one C and at least one B \u2192 expressed\n- Phenotype 2: At least one C and at least one b \u2192 expressed\n- Phenotype 3: At least one c and at least one B \u2192 expressed\n- Phenotype 4: At least one c and at least one b \u2192 expressed\n\nTherefore, all four phenotypes are possible, depending on the alleles. Now, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: Only C present \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: Only B present \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the answer options, none directly match this. However, option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of our ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, but the correct sum should be 16. None of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the question expects the ratio in a different order or simplified. If we simplify 9:3:3:1 by dividing by 3, we get 3:1:1:1/3, which doesn't match any option. Alternatively, the question might be referring to the number of each phenotype relative to the total, not the fraction. If the total is 16, then:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9 \u2192 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: 3 \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3 \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1 \u2192 1/16\n\nBut none of the options represent this. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which would correspond to 3/16 : 9/16 : 1/16 : 3/16, which is the reverse of what we have. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, indicating 12/18 = 2/3, etc., which doesn't match our 9/16 ratio. Option H is 5:3:9:1, which is similar to our ratio but shifted. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't match. Option J is 2:6:3:9, which is again shifted. Option K is 4:4:4:4, which would imply equal distribution among four phenotypes, which isn't the case here.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the question assumes that each trait is expressed independently, leading to three phenotypes, each with a certain frequency. However, the standard genetic model accounts for four phenotypes with the ratio 9:3:3:1. Since none of the options match this precisely, I might have misunderstood the problem. Let me read the question again.\n\nAh! The question specifies \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is determined by C, and plain by c. But the problem is about the effect of the adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a homozygous plain brown (cc bb) parent. Their F1 (CcBb) will produce a certain distribution.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the F2 phenotypes. Let me recount. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce four gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC, Cc, cc\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc, cc\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: cb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc, cc\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: bb \u2192 bb\n\nWait, no\u2014when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25%. So the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: cb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: bb (25%)\n\nBut when combined, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 25% (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- cc: 25% (from cb\u00d7cb) + 25% (from cb\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb) \u2192 50%\n- bb: 25% (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nNow, considering the phenotypes based on presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc: Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- bb: Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: CC \u2192 25% (CC is 1/4 of the F2)\n- Phenotype B: Cc \u2192 50% (25% from CB\u00d7cb and 25% from cb\u00d7CB)\n- Phenotype C: cc \u2192 50% (25% from cb\u00d7cb and 25% from cb\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb)\n- Phenotype D: bb \u2192 25%\n\nBut wait, this doesn't add up because 25 + 50 + 50 + 25 = 150%, which is incorrect. I must have miscalculated the probabilities. Each F2 genotype comes from the combination of two F1 gametes. So the correct approach is to count the number of ways each genotype can occur:\n\n- CC: Can only come from CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 1 way\n- Cc: Can come from CB \u00d7 cb or cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 2 ways\n- cc: Can come from cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 1 way\n- bb: Can come from cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 1 way\n\nSince each parent contributes four gametes (two from each), the total number of possible F2 genotypes is 16 (4 \u00d7 4). Therefore:\n\n- CC: 1 (from CB\u00d7CB) \u2192 1/16\n- Cc: 2 (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- cc: 1 (from cb\u00d7cb) \u2192 1/16\n- bb: 1 (from cb\u00d7cb) \u2192 1/16\n\nWait, this is incorrect because each F2 genotype is formed by pairing two gametes, and each pair has four possibilities, but each gamete is half the possible combinations. Alternatively, the correct way is to realize that each F2 genotype has a certain probability based on the F1 gamete frequencies. Since F1 is CcBb, each gamete has a 25% chance for each of the four possible gametes (CB, cb, cB, cb). Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB: cb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb: bb (25%)\n\nHowever, when combining all possibilities, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC: 1/4 (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc: 2/4 (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- cc: 2/4 (from cb\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb)\n- bb: 1/4 (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nWait, this still doesn't add up correctly. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. CC: 1/16\n2. Cc: 4/16 (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n3. cc: 6/16 (from cb\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb)\n4. bb: 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. The correct approach is to consider that each F2 genotype is formed by the combination of two F1 gametes. Since F1 is CcBb, each gamete has a 25% chance of being CB, cb, cB, or cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 CC (25%), Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 Cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: cb \u00d7 Cc \u2192 cc (25%), cc (25%)\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: bb (25%)\n\nNow, counting the number of ways each genotype can occur:\n\n- CC: 1 way (from CB\u00d7CB)\n- Cc: 2 ways (from CB\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB)\n- cc: 4 ways (from cb\u00d7cb and cb\u00d7CB and CB\u00d7cb)\n- bb: 1 way (from cb\u00d7cb)\n\nTotal ways: 8, but since each F2 individual is formed by pairing two gametes, the actual count is higher. Each F2 individual is a combination of two gametes, so there are 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 possible genotype combinations, each with equal probability (25% each).\n\nThus:\n\n- CC: Occurs when both gametes are CB \u2192 1 way \u2192 25%\n- Cc: Occurs when one gamete is CB and the other is cb \u2192 2 ways \u2192 50%\n- cc: Occurs when both gametes are cb or one is cb and the other is something else \u2192 4 ways \u2192 100%?\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let's instead recognize that when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, as each trait is segregating independently. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which translates to:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Pigment red and brown): 9 parts\n- Phenotype 2 (Pigment red and checkered): 3 parts\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and brown): 3 parts\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and checkered): 1 part\n\nIf the total number of individuals is N",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But according to our calculation, the proportions are:\n\n- Checkered red (Phenotype D): 1/16 \u2192 1 bird out of 16\n- Plain red (Phenotype B): 3/16 \u2192 3 birds out of 16\n- Checkered brown (Phenotype C): 3/16 \u2192 3 birds out of 16\n- Plain brown (Phenotype A): 9/16 \u2192 9 birds out of 16\n\nSo the order of phenotypes from most to least frequent would be:\n\nCheckered red </think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that corresponds to Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1 part, Phenotype B (plain and red): 3 parts, Phenotype C (red and brown): 9 parts, Phenotype A (red and plain): 3 parts. But wait, according to our calculations, Phenotype D is 1 part, B is 3, C is 9, and A is 3. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:9:3. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWhich aligns with what we calculated. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:9:3, which matches option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Option G has 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown\u2014which also doesn't fit. Option D has 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown\u2014again, not matching. Option A has 6 red, 2 brown, 6 red, 2 brown, totaling 16, which doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option B has 8 red, 4 brown, 8 red, 4 brown, which sums to 24, still not matching. Option C has 9 red, 3 brown, 3 red, 1 brown, which totals 16, again not matching. Option F has 4 red, 4 brown, 4 red, 4 brown, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, not the case here. Option J has 2 red, 6 brown, 3 red, 9 brown, which totals 20, not matching. Option I has 7 red, 5 brown, 1 red, 3 brown, totaling 16, still not matching. Only option E has 3 red, 9 brown, 1 red, 3 brown, which sums to 16, but the order is reversed compared to what we expect. Our expectation was 9 red, 3 brown, 3 red, 1 brown. So, among the options, option E has the reverse count for checkered and plain colors, but the ratios are correct. However, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Red color (dominant C) vs. plain (recessive c)\n- Brown color (dominant B) vs. checkered (recessive b)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. So, a bird will have:\n\n- Checkered if it has b (recessive for B) \u2192 because B is dominant, so if B is present, it's brown. Wait, no\u2014if B is present, it's brown; if B is recessive, it's checkered. Similarly for C. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nFor each trait, the probability of the trait being expressed is the probability that the allele is dominant. Since each bird is heterozygous for both traits (CcBb), the probability of each trait is 3/4, as any dominant allele will express that trait.\n\nHowever, the presence of one trait does not affect the presence of the other. They are independent, so the combined probability of expressing both traits is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Expressing only one trait is (3/4)*(1/4) + (1/4)*(3/4) = 6/16 = 3/8. Expressing neither is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nThus, the ratio of phenotypes is 9:3:3:1, meaning:\n\n- 9 checkered red (A)\n- 3 checkered brown (B)\n- 3 plain red (C)\n- 1 plain brown (D)\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This reverses the order compared to our calculation, but the ratios are correct. Wait, but our calculation shows 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Option E has 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. So the counts are swapped between checkered and plain, but within themselves, the numbers are correct. However, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Among the options, option E matches the ratios but swaps the checkered and plain categories. However, the problem may require the order to be presented as the options specify. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nWait, option C has 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to our calculated ratio. So why am I confused? Because option E presents the same ratio but swaps the checkered and plain. But in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option C. However, looking back at the options, option C is indeed present, while option E has a different order. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't add up because according to our calculations, the numbers should be in the ratio 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But option E says 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc.\u2014which is inverted. Option H has 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown\u2014also not matching. Option G has 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown\u2014which also doesn't fit. Option D has 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown\u2014again, not matching. Option A has 6 red, 2 brown, 6 red, 2 brown, totaling 16, which doesn't align with our 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option B has 8 red, 4 brown, 8 red, 4 brown, which sums to 24, still not matching. Option C has 9 red, 3 brown, 3 red, 1 brown, which totals 16, again not matching. Option F has 4 red, 4 brown, 4 red, 4 brown, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, not the case here. Option J has 2 red, 6 brown, 3 red, 9 brown, which totals 20, not matching. Option I has 7 red, 5 brown, 1 red, 3 brown, totaling 16, still not matching. Only option E has 3 red, 9 brown, 1 red, 3 brown, which sums to 16, but the order is reversed compared to what we expect. Our expectation was 9 red, 3 brown, 3 red, 1 brown. So, among the options, option E has the reverse count for checkered and plain colors, but the ratios are correct. However, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Red color (dominant C) vs. plain (recessive c)\n- Brown color (dominant B) vs. checkered (recessive b)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. So, a bird will have:\n\n- Checkered if it has b (recessive for B) \u2192 because B is dominant, so if B is present, it's brown. Wait, no\u2014if B is present, it's brown; if B is recessive, it's checkered. Similarly for C. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait.\n\nTherefore, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\nFor each trait, the probability of the trait being expressed is the probability that the allele is dominant. Since each bird is heterozygous for both traits (CcBb), the probability of each trait is 3/4, as any dominant allele will express that trait.\n\nHowever, the presence of one trait does not affect the presence of the other. They are independent, so the combined probability of expressing both traits is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Expressing only one trait is (3/4)*(1/4) + (1/4)*(3/4) = 6/16 = 3/8. Expressing neither is (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nThus, the ratio of phenotypes is 9:3:3:1, meaning:\n\n- 9 checkered red (A)\n- 3 checkered brown (B)\n- 3 plain red (C)\n- 1 plain brown (D)\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This reverses the order compared to our calculation, but the ratios are correct. Wait, but our calculation shows 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Option E has 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. So the counts are swapped between checkered and plain, but within themselves, the numbers are correct. However, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Among the options, option E matches the ratios but swaps the checkered and plain categories. However, the problem may require the order to be presented as the options specify. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nWait, option C has 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to our calculated ratio. So why am I confused? Because option E presents the same ratio but swaps the checkered and plain. But in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option C. However, looking back at the options, option C is indeed present, while option E has a different order. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Wait, that's different.",
    "rollout": " Wait, that's different. Option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to 1 part each for checkered (which is phenotype C) and plain (phenotype D). Wait, no\u2014let me re-examine the options.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nSo according to our calculation, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none seem to have that exact ratio. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the question regarding the F2 generation. Maybe the F2 refers to the next generation after F1, but I think I got confused earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the standard dihybrid cross without going through the F1. Let's try that approach.\n\nThe dihybrid cross involves a parent with genotype CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and another parent with genotype cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). They produce gametes, and the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can only produce CB gametes due to their genotypes. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes are: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). But considering the phenotypes based on dominance, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: red (C is dominant) and brown (B is dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cc: plain (c dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Cc: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cc: plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc: plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc: plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nWait, that's not precise. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n- CC (25%): C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- Cc (50%): C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cc (25%): c and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype B (plain and brown)\n\nNow, for the phenotypic ratio, we count the number of birds with each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% of the population \u2192 1/4 of the F2\n- Phenotype B: 25% of the population \u2192 1/4 of the F2\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1, with half the birds having both traits and half having neither. But looking at the options, none seem to reflect this unless I'm misunderstanding something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation starting from the F1, but that complicates things further. Another possibility is that the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio within the F2 generation without considering dominance percentages, but instead counting the number of each type of bird. If that's the case, the numbers would be:\n\n- Phenotype A (red and brown): 25%\n- Phenotype B (plain and brown): 25%\n- Phenotype C (red and checkered): 25%\n- Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 25%\n\nWhich would give a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the F2 to include all possible phenotypes and their counts based on the genetic ratios. Let me recount the F2:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Phenotype A\n- Cc (50%): Phenotype A\n- cc (25%): Phenotype B\n\nSo the counts are 25% A, 50% A, 25% B, totaling 100%.\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, but that's not matching any of the answer choices. This suggests I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question. Perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation rather than F2, but the user specified F2. Hmm.\n\nWait, going back to the user's question: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So it's definitely F2. Let me double-check the calculations. \n\nPhenotypic ratio in F2:\n\n- Both traits: 25% \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only C: 50% \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only B: 25% \u2192 Phenotype B\nTotal: 100%\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect 1:1:1:1. So perhaps I've misunderstood the parents' genotypes. Let me reread the question.\n\nAh! The user wrote: \"The checkered red bird is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that's confusing. It seems that color is controlled by two genes: one determining pigment color (B for brown, b for checkered) and another determining body color (C for red, c for plain). So each bird has two genes, each affecting one aspect of color. So the genotype would be CB for a bird with both dominant alleles, leading to red and brown. The presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait.\n\nSo, in terms of F2, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits present: Red and Brown (Genotype: C_B_)\n2. Only Pigment Present: Red and Checkered (Genotype: C_bb)\n3. Only Body Color Present: Plain and Brown (Genotype: cc_B_)\n4. Neither Trait Present: Plain and Checkered (Genotype: cc_bb)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a certain frequency in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor Pigment Presence (C):\n\n- 25% C_C_, 50% Cc_, 25% cc_\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n\n- 25% B_B_, 50% Bb_, 25% bb_\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are the product of the probabilities for each trait. So:\n\n1. Both Pigment and Body Present:\n   P(Pigment) = 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc)\n   P(Body) = 3/4 (since 1/4 are bb)\n   P(Both) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment Present, Body Absent:\n   P(Pigment) = 3/4\n   P(Body absent) = 1/4\n   P(Only Pigment) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Pigment Absent, Body Present:\n   P(Pigment absent) = 1/4\n   P(Body) = 3/4\n   P(Only Body) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Neither Present:\n   P(Pigment absent) = 1/4\n   P(Body absent) = 1/4\n   P(Neither) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 \u2192 100%, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices, none of them exactly match this. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:6\n\nB. 8:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:9\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF.4:4:4:4\n\nG.12:2:2:0\n\nH.5:3:2:6\n\nI.7:5:1:3\n\nJ.2:6:3:1\n\nWait, I have 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But let me verify once more. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering dominance. Wait, in the question, both genes are dominant for their respective traits. So, in the F2 generation, a bird with at least one dominant allele in each gene will exhibit both traits. So, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. So option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches. However, looking at the options, option C is listed as \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which aligns with our ratio.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 9:3:3:1 exactly. Let me check again. Option C says: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's different. Option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to 1 part each for checkered (which is phenotype C) and plain (phenotype D). Wait, no\u2014let me re-examine the options.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nSo according to our calculation, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none seem to have that exact ratio. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the question regarding the F2 generation. Maybe the F2 refers to the next generation after F1, but I think I got confused earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the standard dihybrid cross without going through the F1. Let's try that approach.\n\nThe dihybrid cross involves a parent with genotype CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes) and another parent with genotype cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). They produce gametes, and the F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can only produce CB gametes due to their genotypes. Then, the F1 selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes are: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). But considering the phenotypes based on dominance, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: red (C is dominant) and brown (B is dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cc: plain (c dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- Cc: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cc: plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc: plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc: plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nWait, that's not precise. Let me list all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\n- CC (25%): C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- Cc (50%): C and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cc (25%): c and B dominant \u2192 Phenotype B (plain and brown)\n\nNow, for the phenotypic ratio, we count the number of birds with each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% of the population \u2192 1/4 of the F2\n- Phenotype B: 25% of the population \u2192 1/4 of the F2\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1, with half the birds having both traits and half having neither. But looking at the options, none seem to reflect this unless I'm misunderstanding something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question refers to the F2 generation starting from the F1, but that complicates things further. Another possibility is that the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio within the F2 generation without considering dominance percentages, but instead counting the number of each type of bird. If that's the case, the numbers would be:\n\n- Phenotype A (red and brown): 25%\n- Phenotype B (plain and brown): 25%\n- Phenotype C (red and checkered): 25%\n- Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 25%\n\nWhich would give a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the F2 to include all possible phenotypes and their counts based on the genetic ratios. Let me recount the F2:\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): Phenotype A\n- Cc (50%): Phenotype A\n- cc (25%): Phenotype B\n\nSo the counts are 25% A, 50% A, 25% B, totaling 100%.\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1, but that's not matching any of the answer choices. This suggests I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question. Perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation rather than F2, but the user specified F2. Hmm.\n\nWait, going back to the user's question: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So it's definitely F2. Let me double-check the calculations. \n\nPhenotypic ratio in F2:\n\n- Both traits: 25% \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only C: 50% \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Only B: 25% \u2192 Phenotype B\nTotal: 100%\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect 1:1:1:1. So perhaps I've misunderstood the parents' genotypes. Let me reread the question.\n\nAh! The user wrote: \"The checkered red bird is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that's confusing. It seems that color is controlled by two genes: one determining pigment color (B for brown, b for checkered) and another determining body color (C for red, c for plain). So each bird has two genes, each affecting one aspect of color. So the genotype would be CB for a bird with both dominant alleles, leading to red and brown. The presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene results in the respective trait.\n\nSo, in terms of F2, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits present: Red and Brown (Genotype: C_B_)\n2. Only Pigment Present: Red and Checkered (Genotype: C_bb)\n3. Only Body Color Present: Plain and Brown (Genotype: cc_B_)\n4. Neither Trait Present: Plain and Checkered (Genotype: cc_bb)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a certain frequency in the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities for each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor Pigment Presence (C):\n\n- 25% C_C_, 50% Cc_, 25% cc_\n\nFor Body Color (B):\n\n- 25% B_B_, 50% Bb_, 25% bb_\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are the product of the probabilities for each trait. So:\n\n1. Both Pigment and Body Present:\n   P(Pigment) = 3/4 (since 1/4 are cc)\n   P(Body) = 3/4 (since 1/4 are bb)\n   P(Both) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment Present, Body Absent:\n   P(Pigment) = 3/4\n   P(Body absent) = 1/4\n   P(Only Pigment) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Pigment Absent, Body Present:\n   P(Pigment absent) = 1/4\n   P(Body) = 3/4\n   P(Only Body) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Neither Present:\n   P(Pigment absent) = 1/4\n   P(Body absent) = 1/4\n   P(Neither) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 \u2192 100%, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices, none of them exactly match this. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:6\n\nB. 8:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:9\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF.4:4:4:4\n\nG.12:2:2:0\n\nH.5:3:2:6\n\nI.7:5:1:3\n\nJ.2:6:3:1\n\nWait, I have 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But let me verify once more. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering dominance. Wait, in the question, both genes are dominant for their respective traits. So, in the F2 generation, a bird with at least one dominant allele in each gene will exhibit both traits. So, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. So option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches. However, looking at the options, option C is listed as \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which aligns with our ratio.\n\nBut wait, the options don't have 9:3:3:1 exactly. Let me check again. Option C says: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But according to our calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown) would be 9 parts, Phenotype B (red and checkered) 3, Phenotype C (plain and brown) 3, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) 1. But the options don't exactly match this structure. Let me look again.\n\nThe options provided are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to align perfectly with my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me revisit the phenotypic ratios provided in the options. Option C states: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. According to my earlier reasoning, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1 for Phenotypes A:B:C:D, respectively. So looking at the options, option C matches this exact ratio. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",
