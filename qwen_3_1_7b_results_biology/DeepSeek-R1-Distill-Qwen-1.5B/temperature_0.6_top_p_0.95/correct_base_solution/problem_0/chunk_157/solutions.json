    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Because according to our analysis, checkered red (which would be phenotype C) is 3, but according to the options, checkered red is 3, which aligns with our count. Wait, no\u2014the confusion arises because the options describe the phenotypes in reverse. Option E says checkered red 3, which would correspond to our count of Phenotype C (plain and brown), which is 3. Similarly, checkered brown is 9, which would be Phenotype B (red and checkered), which is 3. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't add up.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So in terms of numbers, if we assume 16 birds, then Phenotype A (red and brown) would be 9, Phenotype B (red and checkered) 3, Phenotype C (plain and brown) 3, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) 1. But looking at the options, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This corresponds to the exact opposite of what we've deduced. Because according to our analysis, checkered red (which would be phenotype C) is 3, but according to the options, checkered red is 3, which aligns with our count. Wait, no\u2014the confusion arises because the options describe the phenotypes in reverse. Option E says checkered red 3, which would correspond to our count of Phenotype C (plain and brown), which is 3. Similarly, checkered brown is 9, which would be Phenotype B (red and checkered), which is 3. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, according to our analysis, Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 3, but option E says checkered brown is 9, which would correspond to Phenotype C. Hmm, perhaps I got the phenotypes reversed in the options. Let me re-express the phenotypes:\n\nOur analysis shows:\n- Phenotype A: red and brown (9)\n- Phenotype B: red and checkered (3)\n- Phenotype C: plain and brown (3)\n- Phenotype D: plain and checkered (1)\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n- Option E: checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3)\nThis translates to:\n- Checkered red: Phenotype C (plain and brown) = 3\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype B (red and checkered) = 3\n- Plain red: Phenotype D (plain and checkered) = 1\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A (red and brown) = 9\n\nWhich matches exactly the options presented in E. So the answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb?

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

This aligns with our calculations: 3 (plain red) corresponds to Phenotype D, 9 (checkered brown) is Phenotype B, 1 (plain red) is Phenotype D, and 3 (checkered brown) is Phenotype B.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect.

For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So according to this, Phenotype A (red and brown) would be 9/16 of the population, Phenotype B (red and checkered) 3/16, Phenotype C (plain and brown) 3/16, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) 1/16.

Option C lists Phenotype A as 9, which aligns with our 9/16 count. However, the options don't specify the order of the phenotypes, but typically, they follow the order of the traits.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But the order is different.",
    "rollout": " But the order is different. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown) as 3, Phenotype B (red and checkered) as 9, Phenotype A (red and brown) as 16, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) as 1. Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+9+16+1=30, but according to our earlier breakdown, the counts should be 9, 3, 3, 1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options.\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich would correspond to:\n\n- checkered red (D): 3 \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown, which is 1 part)\n- checkered brown (B): 9 \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown, 9 parts)\n- plain red (A): 1 \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered, 1 part)\n- plain brown (C): 3 \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered, 3 parts)\n\nBut according to our calculations, the proportions should be:\n\nPhenotype A: 9 parts (red and brown)\nPhenotype B: 3 parts (red and checkered)\nPhenotype C: 3 parts (plain and brown)\nPhenotype D: 1 part (plain and checkered)\n\nSo the correct counts should be 9, 3, 3, 1. None of the options seem to exactly match this, but let me look again:\n\nLooking at option J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nThat would be:\n\n- checkered red: 2 \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown, 1 part)\n- checkered brown: 6 \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown, 9 parts, but 6 is 2/3 of 9)\n- plain red: 3 \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered, 1 part)\n- plain brown: 1 \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered, 3 parts, but 1 is 1/3 of 3)\n\nHmm, that doesn't align perfectly. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the actual numbers without dividing by the total. For example, if there are 16 birds, the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nWhich would mean that among 16 birds, 9 are red and brown, 3 are red and checkered, 3 are plain and brown, and 1 is plain and checkered. Comparing this to the options, none directly match this, but option E lists 3,9,1,3, which seems reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the F2 generation, considering that each bird is diploid, so the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but the options don't list this directly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis corresponds to:\n\n- checkered red: 3 \u2192 D (plain and brown, 1 part)\n- checkered brown:9 \u2192 A (red and brown, 9 parts)\n- plain red:1 \u2192 C (plain and brown, 1 part)\n- plain brown:3 \u2192 B (red and checkered, 3 parts)\n\nThis seems incorrect because checkered red should be 3, which is D, but according to our earlier analysis, D should be 1. This suggests that perhaps the options are misrepresented, or I've misunderstood the phenotype definitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation, not the ratio. In that case, if there are 16 birds, the counts would be 9 red and brown, 3 red and checkered, 3 plain and brown, and 1 plain and checkered. None of the options provide this exact distribution, but option E has 3,9,1,3, which seems reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratio without considering the actual number of birds, focusing purely on the proportion. In that case, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options reflect this exactly.\n\nWait, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis would translate to 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, and 3 plain brown. According to our analysis, the correct counts should be 9, 3, 3, 1. So this doesn't match. Perhaps the options are incorrectly labeled, or I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotype definitions.\n\nAnother possibility is that the letters in the options refer to the phenotypes differently. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the other trait. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy. The problem states: Checkered is the recessive allele 'c', and plain is 'C'. So checkered is recessive (c), and plain is dominant (C). Therefore, a bird with at least one 'c' will be checkered, and a bird with at least one 'C' will be plain. Wait, no\u2014the problem says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So 'C' is dominant for color (red), and 'c' is recessive for color (plain). Similarly, 'B' is dominant for body color, and 'b' is recessive. So the phenotype is determined by both traits. A bird with at least one dominant allele for each trait will exhibit both traits. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one 'C' and at least one 'B', it will have both traits: red and brown.\n- If a bird has at least one 'C' and at least one 'b', it will have red and checkered.\n- If a bird has at least one 'c' and at least one 'B', it will have plain and brown.\n- If a bird has at least one 'c' and at least one 'b', it will have plain and checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes are as previously defined. Now, considering that, the F2 generation has 16 birds, and the phenotypic distribution should be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. However, looking closely, option E has 3,9,1,3, which seems to reverse the order of the first two classes compared to the correct distribution. Option J has 2,6,3,1, which also doesn't fit. Option G has 12,2,2,2, which doesn't align. Option H has 5,3,2,6, which doesn't fit either. Option I has 7,5,1,3, which also doesn't match. Option F has 4,4,4,4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't apply here. Option A has a frequency ratio of 6:2:6:2, which is a 3:1:3:1 ratio, which doesn't fit. Option B has 6,2,6,2, same as A. Option C has 9,3,3,1, which is close to the correct distribution, but the order is wrong. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which is inverted. \n\nGiven this, the closest option is C, which has a frequency ratio of 9:3:3:1, but the order is incorrect. However, perhaps the options are designed to ignore the order, and only the relative sizes matter, making option C the best choice despite the order mismatch. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the probabilities:\n\nEach bird has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele for each gene (i.e., 9/16 for red and brown, 3/16 for red and checkered, etc.). Wait, no, that's not accurate because the presence of dominant alleles doesn't affect the presence of the other trait. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C if we disregard the order, but the order matters in the answer choices. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match, but option C is the closest in terms of the ratio.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, option E has 3,9,1,3, which is similar to option C's 9,3,3,1 but swapped. Since the options are presented as follows:\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThe correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is option C. Despite the order being reversed, perhaps the intended answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But the order is different. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to Phenotype C (plain and brown) as 3, Phenotype B (red and checkered) as 9, Phenotype A (red and brown) as 16, and Phenotype D (plain and checkered) as 1. Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+9+16+1=30, but according to our earlier breakdown, the counts should be 9, 3, 3, 1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options.\n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich would correspond to:\n\n- checkered red (D): 3 \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown, which is 1 part)\n- checkered brown (B): 9 \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown, 9 parts)\n- plain red (A): 1 \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered, 1 part)\n- plain brown (C): 3 \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered, 3 parts)\n\nBut according to our calculations, the proportions should be:\n\nPhenotype A: 9 parts (red and brown)\nPhenotype B: 3 parts (red and checkered)\nPhenotype C: 3 parts (plain and brown)\nPhenotype D: 1 part (plain and checkered)\n\nSo the correct counts should be 9, 3, 3, 1. None of the options seem to exactly match this, but let me look again:\n\nLooking at option J: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nThat would be:\n\n- checkered red: 2 \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown, 1 part)\n- checkered brown: 6 \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown, 9 parts, but 6 is 2/3 of 9)\n- plain red: 3 \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered, 1 part)\n- plain brown: 1 \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered, 3 parts, but 1 is 1/3 of 3)\n\nHmm, that doesn't align perfectly. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the actual numbers without dividing by the total. For example, if there are 16 birds, the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nWhich would mean that among 16 birds, 9 are red and brown, 3 are red and checkered, 3 are plain and brown, and 1 is plain and checkered. Comparing this to the options, none directly match this, but option E lists 3,9,1,3, which seems reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the F2 generation, considering that each bird is diploid, so the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but the options don't list this directly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis corresponds to:\n\n- checkered red: 3 \u2192 D (plain and brown, 1 part)\n- checkered brown:9 \u2192 A (red and brown, 9 parts)\n- plain red:1 \u2192 C (plain and brown, 1 part)\n- plain brown:3 \u2192 B (red and checkered, 3 parts)\n\nThis seems incorrect because checkered red should be 3, which is D, but according to our earlier analysis, D should be 1. This suggests that perhaps the options are misrepresented, or I've misunderstood the phenotype definitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation, not the ratio. In that case, if there are 16 birds, the counts would be 9 red and brown, 3 red and checkered, 3 plain and brown, and 1 plain and checkered. None of the options provide this exact distribution, but option E has 3,9,1,3, which seems reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the ratio without considering the actual number of birds, focusing purely on the proportion. In that case, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options reflect this exactly.\n\nWait, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis would translate to 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, and 3 plain brown. According to our analysis, the correct counts should be 9, 3, 3, 1. So this doesn't match. Perhaps the options are incorrectly labeled, or I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotype definitions.\n\nAnother possibility is that the letters in the options refer to the phenotypes differently. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the other trait. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy. The problem states: Checkered is the recessive allele 'c', and plain is 'C'. So checkered is recessive (c), and plain is dominant (C). Therefore, a bird with at least one 'c' will be checkered, and a bird with at least one 'C' will be plain. Wait, no\u2014the problem says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So 'C' is dominant for color (red), and 'c' is recessive for color (plain). Similarly, 'B' is dominant for body color, and 'b' is recessive. So the phenotype is determined by both traits. A bird with at least one dominant allele for each trait will exhibit both traits. So:\n\n- If a bird has at least one 'C' and at least one 'B', it will have both traits: red and brown.\n- If a bird has at least one 'C' and at least one 'b', it will have red and checkered.\n- If a bird has at least one 'c' and at least one 'B', it will have plain and brown.\n- If a bird has at least one 'c' and at least one 'b', it will have plain and checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes are as previously defined. Now, considering that, the F2 generation has 16 birds, and the phenotypic distribution should be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. However, looking closely, option E has 3,9,1,3, which seems to reverse the order of the first two classes compared to the correct distribution. Option J has 2,6,3,1, which also doesn't fit. Option G has 12,2,2,2, which doesn't align. Option H has 5,3,2,6, which doesn't fit either. Option I has 7,5,1,3, which also doesn't match. Option F has 4,4,4,4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't apply here. Option A has a frequency ratio of 6:2:6:2, which is a 3:1:3:1 ratio, which doesn't fit. Option B has 6,2,6,2, same as A. Option C has 9,3,3,1, which is close to the correct distribution, but the order is wrong. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which is inverted. \n\nGiven this, the closest option is C, which has a frequency ratio of 9:3:3:1, but the order is incorrect. However, perhaps the options are designed to ignore the order, and only the relative sizes matter, making option C the best choice despite the order mismatch. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount the probabilities:\n\nEach bird has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele for each gene (i.e., 9/16 for red and brown, 3/16 for red and checkered, etc.). Wait, no, that's not accurate because the presence of dominant alleles doesn't affect the presence of the other trait. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C if we disregard the order, but the order matters in the answer choices. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match, but option C is the closest in terms of the ratio.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, option E has 3,9,1,3, which is similar to option C's 9,3,3,1 but swapped. Since the options are presented as follows:\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThe correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is option C. Despite the order being reversed, perhaps the intended answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWhich corresponds to Phenotype C (plain red), Phenotype B (red checkered), Phenotype A (red brown), Phenotype D (plain brown). So according to our analysis, the F2 phenotypes and their counts would be in the ratio of 1:3:3:1, i.e., 9:3:3:1, but scaled by 16. However, the options don't directly list this. Instead, they list the numbers themselves. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which aligns perfectly with the counts we've deduced. Therefore, the correct answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So Option E is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. So in terms of numbers, that's 3:9:1:3. But let me double-check the calculations to ensure accuracy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've mixed up the order. Let me list the phenotypes again:\n\n- Phenotype A: Checkered and Brown (CC bb) \u2192 1/16\n- Phenotype B: Checkered and Red (cc BB) \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Plain and Brown (cc Bb) \u2192 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Plain and Checkered (cc bb) \u2192 1/16\n\nIf the total is 16 parts, then the counts would be:\n\n- Checkered Brown: 1 part\n- Checkered Red: 3 parts\n- Plain Brown: 3 parts\n- Plain Checkered: 1 part\n\nWhich corresponds to option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's 3:9:1:3, but according to our calculation, it's 1:3:3:1. Hmm, that's different. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, no\u2014because each bird has two traits, and the probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits present (A): 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Only C (B): 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Only B (C): 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Neither (D): 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nSo the counts would be 9, 3, 3, 1. Which is option E: checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (9). Wait, that's conflicting with my previous conclusion. Wait, no, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. So that aligns with our calculation of 9,3,3,1. But looking at the options, option E matches this exactly. So the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the ratio would be 3:9:1:3. But looking at the options, option E states \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Which corresponds to Phenotypes D, B, A, C. But according to our calculations, Phenotype D (none) is 1, B is 3, A is 9, and C is 3. So the order in the answer options might correspond to Phenotype D first, then B, then A, then C. Option E lists checkered red (D) as 3, checkered brown (B) as 9, plain red (A) as 1, and plain brown (C) as 3. Yes, that matches exactly. So the correct ratio is 1:3:9:9, but wait no\u2014our calculation was 1 (D) : 3 (B) : 9 (A) : 3 (C). But the options don't seem to list them in order. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nYes, that matches our count of 1, 3, 9, 3 for D, B, A, C respectively. So the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But according to our analysis, the numbers should be 9:3:3:1. So looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That aligns with our count. Let me double-check the reasoning to ensure I didn't make a mistake. The key points were: - Parents are CC BB and cc bb.\n- F1 is CcBb, which results in a 1:1:1:1 ratio among the gametes (assuming no crossing over or other complexities).\n- F2 has a 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering two independent genes, leading to four phenotypic classes as described.\n\nThus, the correct answer should reflect the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which corresponds to option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nWhich corresponds to 3 (checkered red), 9 (checkered brown), 1 (plain red), 3 (plain brown). This matches exactly what we've calculated. So the correct answer should reflect this distribution.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Option E states: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3. That aligns with our calculations where:\n- Checkered red (Class D): 1 part\n- Checkered brown (Class B): 3 parts\n- Plain red (Class C): 3 parts\n- Plain brown (Class A): 9 parts\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:9, which corresponds to option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to checkered red (C and b), checkered brown (c and B), plain red (cc and B), plain brown (C and b). Wait, but according to our calculations, the order should be:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc BB)\n2. Checkered brown (cc Bb)\n3. Plain red (cc bb)\n4. Plain brown (Cc BB)\n\nBut looking back, our phenotypic classes are:\n\nA. Checkered red (phenotype 4, cc BB)\nB. Checkered brown (phenotype 2, cc Bb)\nC. Plain red (phenotype 3, cc bb)\nD. Plain brown (phenotype 1, Cc BB)\n\nSo the counts should be 1 (for checkered red), 3 (checkered brown), 3 (plain red), and 9 (plain brown). Which corresponds to option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, but in our earlier analysis, the count was 9 for both traits present, 3 each for one trait, and 1 for neither. So checking the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Yes, that matches.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Maybe I made a mistake in determining the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and count the phenotypes. Let's try that:\n\nPossible F2 Genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (red, brown)\n2. CC Bb (red, brown)\n3. CC bb (red, checkered)\n4. Cc BB (red, brown)\n5. Cc Bb (red, brown)\n6.

So now I'm confused. Which method is correct?\n\nAh, I realize I made a mistake earlier. The F2 generation includes all possible genotypes, but the phenotypic ratios are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact genotype. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So let's recalculate based on the correct grouping.\n\nEach bird has two traits:\n\n- Pigment Color: Red if at least one C allele; else, plain.\n- Body Color: Brown if at least one B allele; else, checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, for each bird, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Probability = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype 2: Only C present \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 3: Only B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratios are 9:3:3:1 for Phenotypes 1:2:3:4 respectively. This aligns with what we get when counting the F2 genotypes based on their phenotypes. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which corresponds to 1:3:3:9 when inverted, which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount the number of birds for each phenotype in the F2 generation. From the 9 possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 4 individuals (all except those with only C or only B)\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): 1 individual (cc bb)\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 2 individuals (cc BB and cc Bb)\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): 1 individual (cc bb)\n\nWait, that's 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8, which doesn't add up to 16. Perhaps I'm missing some genotypes. Let me re-examine the possible F2 genotypes. The possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo that's 9 genotypes. Their phenotypes:\n\n- A: 4\n- C: 2\n- D: 1\n\nTotal: 7, but this doesn't add up. Wait, I must have missed some. Oh no, I think I included only 9 genotypes, but in reality, each F2 generation should have 16 birds, assuming a large population. Let's list all 16 possibilities. Since the parents are CcBb x CcBb, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of the parents' gametes. Each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n3. cb x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n4. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n5. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n6. CB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n7. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n8. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n9. CB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n10. cb x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n11. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n12. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n13. CB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n14. cb x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n15. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n16. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Actually, the correct way to create a Punnett square for F2 is to cross each allele pair from each parent. Each parent's gametes are C/B and c/b. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n       | C    | c\n-------|------|---\n     C    | CC  | Cc\n     c      | Cc  | cc\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n       | B    | b\n-------|------|---\n     B    | BB  | Bb\n     b      | Bb  | bb\n\nCombining both loci, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations:\n\nFrom C locus: CC, Cc, cc\nFrom B locus: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSo the combined genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n10. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n11. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n12. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n13. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n14. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n15. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n16. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n17. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n18. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, that can't be right. The F2 generation from a dihybrid cross should have 16 possible genotypes, each represented once. But according to the Punnett square above, I've listed 18, which is incorrect. Let me correct this. The proper F2 genotypes from a dihybrid cross (CcBb x CcBb) are all combinations of the C and B alleles. So the 16 possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n10. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n11. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n12. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n13. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n14. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n15. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n16. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n17. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n18. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThis still seems off because each F2 generation from a dihybrid cross should have 16 distinct genotypes. However, some genotypes may repeat. For example, CC BB appears twice, but in reality, each occurrence results in the same phenotype. So the unique phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 4 (from CC BB, Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc bb)\nWait, no. Let me go back. Each bird has two traits, so each genotype maps to one phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. Let's list each F2 genotype and their corresponding phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 A\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 A\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\n\nWait, this only accounts for 7 phenotypes, but there are supposed to be 4 phenotypes (A, B, C, D). I'm clearly making a mistake here. The correct way is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each trait. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits present (A)\n2. Only first trait present (B)\n3. Only second trait present (C)\n4. Neither trait present (D)\n\nSo in the F2 generation, how many birds exhibit each phenotype?\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 Any combination where the bird has at least one C and one B allele. These include:\n\n   - CC BB\n   - CC Bb\n   - Cc BB\n   - Cc Bb\n   - cc BB\n   - cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014because each bird must have at least one C and one B allele. So the valid genotypes for A are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n\nThat's six genotypes. But wait, that's six birds, while the others would be fewer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of birds for each phenotype based on the Punnett square without listing all 16 possibilities. Since the F2 genotypes are derived from the parents' gametes, each parent can produce four types: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the Punnett square combines these:\n\nThe resulting genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n5. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n6. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n7. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n8. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n9. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n10. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n11. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n12. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n13. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n14. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n15. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n16. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Instead, let's focus on the phenotypic ratios based on the probabilities. As established earlier, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But according to our analysis, the correct phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Option E. But looking back, the user provided several options, including Option G which states a different ratio, but according to our calculations, it's 9:3:3:1. Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in determining the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and count the phenotypes. Let's try that:\n\nPossible F2 Genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (red, brown)\n2. CC Bb (red, brown)\n3. CC bb (red, checkered)\n4. Cc BB (red, brown)\n5. Cc Bb (red, brown)\n6. Cc bb (red, checkered)\n7. cc BB (plain, brown)\n8. cc Bb (plain, brown)\n9. cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\nRed and Brown (phenotype A):\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Total of 4\n\nRed and Checkered (phenotype B):\n\n- CC bb \u2192 1\n\nPlain and Brown (phenotype C):\n\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb \u2192 2\n\nPlain and Checkered (phenotype D):\n\n- cc bb \u2192 1\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- A: 4\n- B: 1\n- C: 2\n- D: 1\n\nTotal: 8\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous approach where the ratio was 9:3:3:1. So now I'm confused. Which method is correct?\n\nAh, I realize I made a mistake earlier. The F2 generation includes all possible genotypes, but the phenotypic ratios are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact genotype. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So let's recalculate based on the correct grouping.\n\nEach bird has two traits:\n\n- Pigment Color: Red if at least one C allele; else, plain.\n- Body Color: Brown if at least one B allele; else, checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, for each bird, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Probability = (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype 2: Only C present \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 3: Only B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratios are 9:3:3:1 for Phenotypes 1:2:3:4 respectively. This aligns with what we get when counting the F2 genotypes based on their phenotypes. Therefore, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which corresponds to 1:3:3:9 when inverted, which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount the number of birds for each phenotype in the F2 generation. From the 9 possible F2 genotypes:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 4 individuals (all except those with only C or only B)\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): 1 individual (cc bb)\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 2 individuals (cc BB and cc Bb)\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): 1 individual (cc bb)\n\nWait, that's 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8, which doesn't add up to 16. Perhaps I'm missing some genotypes. Let me re-examine the possible F2 genotypes. The possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nSo that's 9 genotypes. Their phenotypes:\n\n- A: 4\n- C: 2\n- D: 1\n\nTotal: 7, but this doesn't add up. Wait, I must have missed some. Oh no, I think I included only 9 genotypes, but in reality, each F2 generation should have 16 birds, assuming a large population. Let's list all 16 possibilities. Since the parents are CcBb x CcBb, the F2 genotypes are all combinations of the parents' gametes. Each parent can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n3. cb x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n4. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n5. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n6. CB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n7. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n8. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n9. CB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n10. cb x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n11. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n12. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n13. CB x cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n14. cb x CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n15. cb x cb \u2192 cc bb\n16. CB x CB \u2192 CC BB\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Actually, the correct way to create a Punnett square for F2 is to cross each allele pair from each parent. Each parent's gametes are C/B and c/b. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n       | C    | c\n-------|------|---\n     C    | CC  | Cc\n     c      | Cc  | cc\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n       | B    | b\n-------|------|---\n     B    | BB  | Bb\n     b      | Bb  | bb\n\nCombining both loci, the F2 genotypes are all possible combinations:\n\nFrom C locus: CC, Cc, cc\nFrom B locus: BB, Bb, bb\n\nSo the combined genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n10. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n11. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n12. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n13. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n14. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n15. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n16. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n17. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n18. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, that can't be right. The F2 generation from a dihybrid cross should have 16 possible genotypes, each represented once. But according to the Punnett square above, I've listed 18, which is incorrect. Let me correct this. The proper F2 genotypes from a dihybrid cross (CcBb x CcBb) are all combinations of the C and B alleles. So the 16 possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n10. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n11. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n12. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n13. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype A\n14. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype A\n15. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype C\n16. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype D\n17. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n18. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThis still seems off because each F2 generation from a dihybrid cross should have 16 distinct genotypes. However, some genotypes may repeat. For example, CC BB appears twice, but in reality, each occurrence results in the same phenotype. So the unique phenotypes are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 4 (from CC BB, Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc bb)\nWait, no. Let me go back. Each bird has two traits, so each genotype maps to one phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles in each trait. Let's list each F2 genotype and their corresponding phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 A\n2. CC Bb \u2192 A\n3. CC bb \u2192 C\n4. Cc BB \u2192 A\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 A\n6. Cc bb \u2192 C\n7. cc BB \u2192 D\n8. cc Bb \u2192 D\n9. cc bb \u2192 D\n\nWait, this only accounts for 7 phenotypes, but there are supposed to be 4 phenotypes (A, B, C, D). I'm clearly making a mistake here. The correct way is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in each trait. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits present (A)\n2. Only first trait present (B)\n3. Only second trait present (C)\n4. Neither trait present (D)\n\nSo in the F2 generation, how many birds exhibit each phenotype?\n\nFor each bird:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 Any combination where the bird has at least one C and one B allele. These include:\n\n   - CC BB\n   - CC Bb\n   - Cc BB\n   - Cc Bb\n   - cc BB\n   - cc Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014because each bird must have at least one C and one B allele. So the valid genotypes for A are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n\nThat's six genotypes. But wait, that's six birds, while the others would be fewer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to count the number of birds for each phenotype based on the Punnett square without listing all 16 possibilities. Since the F2 genotypes are derived from the parents' gametes, each parent can produce four types: CB, cb, cB, cb. So the Punnett square combines these:\n\nThe resulting genotypes are:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n5. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n6. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n7. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n8. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n9. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n10. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n11. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n12. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n13. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n14. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n15. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n16. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Instead, let's focus on the phenotypic ratios based on the probabilities. As established earlier, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking for a ratio among the choices that matches 9:3:3:1. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA.

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, option E says \"Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3\" which corresponds to Phenotypes D, B, C, A respectively.

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But let me double-check: the numbers add up to 16, which corresponds to the 9+3+3+1 parts.",
    "rollout": " But let me double-check: the numbers add up to 16, which corresponds to the 9+3+3+1 parts. So the expected ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype D): 1\n- Checkered brown (phenotype B): 3\n- Plain red (phenotype C): 3\n- Plain brown (phenotype A): 9\n\nSo the order is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown \u2192 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. Looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of what we have. Option A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't match. Option C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Again, inverted. Option G: 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Not matching. Option H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No. Option J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No. Option F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All same, which isn't the case. Option I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No. Option D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 This matches our count exactly.\n\nWait, but looking back, I thought the probabilities were 1:3:3:9, but according to the options, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is reversed. Hmm, did I get confused with the order? Let me clarify. The phenotypes are ordered as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. From our calculations, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 9\n\nSo the correct order is 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. But option D lists 1,3,9,3, which is the reverse. Option E lists 3,9,1,3, which is also reversed. Wait, but the user presented the options as:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nLooking at the counts I derived: 1 (Checkered red) : 3 (Checkered brown) : 3 (Plain red) : 9 (Plain brown). None of the options exactly match this, but option E has 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which is also reversed. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the Punnett square construction. Maybe I miscounted the phenotypic classes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes. Let's do that. The F2 genotypes will include:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, mapping each genotype to phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (since C is recessive, but wait, no\u2014if C is recessive, does that mean the bird is plain? Wait, hold on. The dominance hierarchy is such that if a bird has at least one recessive allele, it's the other phenotype. Wait, but in terms of pigment color, the presence of a dominant allele (like C) results in red, while the recessive (c) results in plain. Similarly for body color: B dominant (brown), b recessive (checkered). So, for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 C present, b recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B present \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Both recessive \u2192 Plain red\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (from CC BB and CC bb)\n- Checkered brown (from CC bb and cc bb)\n- Plain brown (from cc BB and cc bb)\n- Plain red (from cc bb)\n\nWait, that's different from before. Earlier, I considered the presence of dominant alleles leading to the respective traits, but now I realize that the presence of the dominant allele determines the trait. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (i.e., C), it's red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, for body color (B), if it has at least one dominant allele (B), it's brown; else, it's checkered. So the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles, without needing to consider both genes together. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (has at least one C and at least one B)\n2. Checkered brown (has at least one C and at least one b)\n3. Plain brown (has at least one c and at least one B)\n4. Plain red (has at least one c and at least one b)\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 population. Each genotype has a certain probability:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain red\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nThis implies that each phenotype appears equally often in the F2 generation. However, looking at the answer options, none have equal distribution. The closest would be option D: 1:3:9:3, but that's 16 total. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the ratios in a different way. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me try another angle. Suppose that the recessive alleles are dominant for one trait and the dominant for another. For example, maybe c is dominant for pigment color and B is dominant for body color. But that contradicts standard biology where the recessive allele is recessive for the trait. Wait, no\u2014that's not the case. Usually, the recessive allele masks the dominant trait. So, if a bird has at least one c allele, it's plain (recessive for pigment) and regardless of B, it's plain. Similarly, if it has at least one B allele, it's brown (recessive for pigment). Wait, no\u2014that's not the case. Pigment color is determined by the presence of pigment alleles, not the recessive ones. So, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's red (dominant pigment); else, it's plain (recessive). Similarly, if it has at least one B allele, it's brown; else, checkered. Therefore, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits, while recessives mask them. Thus, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait. So, the possible phenotypes are as previously outlined. But in that case, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes. But none of the answer options reflect this exact equality.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the four phenotypes, treating each as distinct regardless of frequency. In that case, since each phenotype occurs with equal frequency (25%), the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that each bird has two traits, and thus the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of both traits. Let me reconsider.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of dominant alleles in each trait leads to the respective phenotype. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits present (Red and Brown)\n2. Only Pigment Present (Red and Checkered)\n3. Only Body Color Present (Plain Brown)\n4. Neither Present (Plain Red)\n\nThe probabilities for each:\n\n1. Both Pigment and Body Present: 25%\n2. Pigment Present, Body Absent: 25%\n3. Pigment Absent, Body Present: 25%\n4. Neither Present: 25%\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But this doesn't align with the answer options provided. Perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to another, not the overall ratio. Alternatively, maybe I've made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAnother possibility is that the recessive alleles are dominant for pigment color, meaning that c (recessive) causes the bird to display the recessive trait, which in this context might be checkered instead of plain. Similarly, B (recessive) would cause the bird to display the recessive trait, which might be plain instead of brown. Wait, no\u2014usually, the recessive allele masks the dominant trait. So, if a bird has at least one c allele, it's plain (recessive for pigment), regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one B allele, it's brown; else, it's checkered. So the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits, while recessives mask them. Therefore, the possible phenotypes remain as before.\n\nGiven that, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the user intended a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype compared to others. For example, the ratio of Checkered red to Checkered brown to Plain red to Plain brown. Since each phenotype is 25%, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But again, this isn't among the answer choices.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum 18\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum 12\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nHmm, none seem to fit exactly. But perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recount the probabilities.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has a 25% chance for each genotype. Each genotype maps to a phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Both Pigment and Body Present \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment Present, Body Absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Pigment Absent, Body Present \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Neither Present \u2192 Plain red\n\nEach of these has a 25% probability, so each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype relative to the others in terms of the number of possible genotypes. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to ask for the ratio of each phenotype to another, such as Checkered red to Checkered brown, which would be 1:1, but the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of possible phenotypic expressions, but that still doesn't align with the answer options. \n\nWait, perhaps the user mixed up the traits. Let me assume that the dominant allele for pigment is C, and for body color is B. Then, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. However, in reality, the recessive allele masks the dominant trait. So, if a bird has at least one C, it's red; else, it's plain. Similarly, if it has at least one B, it's brown; else, it's checkered. Thus, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, and the recessive alleles lead to the masking.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both Pigment and Body Present (Red and Brown)\n2. Pigment Present, Body Absent (Red and Checkered)\n3. Pigment Absent, Body Present (Plain Brown)\n4. Neither Present (Plain Red)\n\nEach of these occurs 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio of the number of each phenotype in a different way, such as comparing each phenotype to itself or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to know the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to each other, not the overall ratio. For instance, the ratio of Checkered red to Checkered brown would be 1:1, but that's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering that each bird has two traits, leading to four possible phenotypes, each occurring equally, hence 1:1:1:1. But again, this isn't among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to the phenotypic ratios based on the number of possible genotypic combinations, not the phenotypic expression. In that case, each bird has a unique genotype, but some genotypes may result in the same phenotype. For example, CC BB and CC bb both result in Checkered red, contributing two individuals to the Checkered red phenotype. Similarly, CC bb and cc bb both contribute to Checkered brown, and so on. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2:2:2, but normalized to the sum of 16, it becomes 1:1:1:1. Still, this isn't an option.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that each bird has two independent traits, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the combination of both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, since this isn't an option, I might need to consider another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio of Checkered red to plain red, considering only the presence of the dominant allele for pigment. Wait, no\u2014that would ignore the body color.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is confusing the dominance hierarchy. Let me consider that the recessive allele is dominant for one trait and recessive for another. For example, suppose that c (recessive for pigment) is dominant for body color, making all birds with at least one c have a certain phenotype, and B (recessive) is dominant for pigment, making all birds with at least one B have another phenotype. But this complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio of Checkered red to plain red, ignoring body color. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: from CC BB and CC bb \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain red: from cc BB and cc bb \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nThus, the ratio would be 50:50, or simplified 1:1. But this is not reflected in the answer options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering that the presence of at least one dominant allele in each trait leads to that trait's manifestation, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the number of each trait. For example:\n\n- Both traits present \u2192 25%\n- Pigment present, body absent \u2192 25%\n- Pigment absent, body present \u2192 25%\n- Neither present \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But again, this isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should revisit the Punnett square approach. Let's create a Punnett square for the F2 generation based on the F1 cross (CcBb x ccbb).\n\nThe F1 genotype is CcBb. When crossed with ccbb, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Cc x cc \u2192 Possible gametes: C (25%), c (75%)\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n\n- Bb x bb \u2192 Possible gametes: B (50%), b (50%)\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 (C x B) = CB, (C x b) = Cb, (c x B) = cB, (c x b) = cb\n\nBut since each parent contributes gametes, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% Ccbb\n- 25% ccBb\n- 25% ccbb\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Both dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- Ccbb: Pigment present, body absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBb: Pigment absent, body present \u2192 Plain brown\n- ccbb: Neither present \u2192 Plain red\n\nThus, the phen",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But let me double-check: the numbers add up to 16, which corresponds to the 9+3+3+1 parts. So the expected ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype D): 1\n- Checkered brown (phenotype B): 3\n- Plain red (phenotype C): 3\n- Plain brown (phenotype A): 9\n\nSo the order is Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown \u2192 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. Looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of what we have. Option A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't match. Option C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Again, inverted. Option G: 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Not matching. Option H: 5:3:2:6 \u2192 No. Option J: 2:6:3:1 \u2192 No. Option F: 4:4:4:4 \u2192 All same, which isn't the case. Option I: 7:5:1:3 \u2192 No. Option D: 1:3:9:3 \u2192 This matches our count exactly.\n\nWait, but looking back, I thought the probabilities were 1:3:3:9, but according to the options, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is reversed. Hmm, did I get confused with the order? Let me clarify. The phenotypes are ordered as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. From our calculations, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 9\n\nSo the correct order is 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. But option D lists 1,3,9,3, which is the reverse. Option E lists 3,9,1,3, which is also reversed. Wait, but the user presented the options as:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nLooking at the counts I derived: 1 (Checkered red) : 3 (Checkered brown) : 3 (Plain red) : 9 (Plain brown). None of the options exactly match this, but option E has 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which is also reversed. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-examine the Punnett square construction. Maybe I miscounted the phenotypic classes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and then map them to phenotypes. Let's do that. The F2 genotypes will include:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, mapping each genotype to phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (since C is recessive, but wait, no\u2014if C is recessive, does that mean the bird is plain? Wait, hold on. The dominance hierarchy is such that if a bird has at least one recessive allele, it's the other phenotype. Wait, but in terms of pigment color, the presence of a dominant allele (like C) results in red, while the recessive (c) results in plain. Similarly for body color: B dominant (brown), b recessive (checkered). So, for each genotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Both C and B present \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 C present, b recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 c recessive, B present \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Both recessive \u2192 Plain red\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (from CC BB and CC bb)\n- Checkered brown (from CC bb and cc bb)\n- Plain brown (from cc BB and cc bb)\n- Plain red (from cc bb)\n\nWait, that's different from before. Earlier, I considered the presence of dominant alleles leading to the respective traits, but now I realize that the presence of the dominant allele determines the trait. So, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (i.e., C), it's red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, for body color (B), if it has at least one dominant allele (B), it's brown; else, it's checkered. So the phenotypes are determined solely by the presence of dominant alleles, without needing to consider both genes together. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (has at least one C and at least one B)\n2. Checkered brown (has at least one C and at least one b)\n3. Plain brown (has at least one c and at least one B)\n4. Plain red (has at least one c and at least one b)\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 population. Each genotype has a certain probability:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 25% \u2192 Plain red\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n\nThis implies that each phenotype appears equally often in the F2 generation. However, looking at the answer options, none have equal distribution. The closest would be option D: 1:3:9:3, but that's 16 total. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the ratios in a different way. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me try another angle. Suppose that the recessive alleles are dominant for one trait and the dominant for another. For example, maybe c is dominant for pigment color and B is dominant for body color. But that contradicts standard biology where the recessive allele is recessive for the trait. Wait, no\u2014that's not the case. Usually, the recessive allele masks the dominant trait. So, if a bird has at least one c allele, it's plain (recessive for pigment) and regardless of B, it's plain. Similarly, if it has at least one B allele, it's brown (recessive for pigment). Wait, no\u2014that's not the case. Pigment color is determined by the presence of pigment alleles, not the recessive ones. So, if a bird has at least one C allele, it's red (dominant pigment); else, it's plain (recessive). Similarly, if it has at least one B allele, it's brown; else, checkered. Therefore, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits, while recessives mask them. Thus, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait. So, the possible phenotypes are as previously outlined. But in that case, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1 across the four phenotypes. But none of the answer options reflect this exact equality.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the four phenotypes, treating each as distinct regardless of frequency. In that case, since each phenotype occurs with equal frequency (25%), the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that each bird has two traits, and thus the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of both traits. Let me reconsider.\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of dominant alleles in each trait leads to the respective phenotype. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits present (Red and Brown)\n2. Only Pigment Present (Red and Checkered)\n3. Only Body Color Present (Plain Brown)\n4. Neither Present (Plain Red)\n\nThe probabilities for each:\n\n1. Both Pigment and Body Present: 25%\n2. Pigment Present, Body Absent: 25%\n3. Pigment Absent, Body Present: 25%\n4. Neither Present: 25%\n\nThus, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But this doesn't align with the answer options provided. Perhaps the user intended to ask for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to another, not the overall ratio. Alternatively, maybe I've made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAnother possibility is that the recessive alleles are dominant for pigment color, meaning that c (recessive) causes the bird to display the recessive trait, which in this context might be checkered instead of plain. Similarly, B (recessive) would cause the bird to display the recessive trait, which might be plain instead of brown. Wait, no\u2014usually, the recessive allele masks the dominant trait. So, if a bird has at least one c allele, it's plain (recessive for pigment), regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one B allele, it's brown; else, it's checkered. So the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits, while recessives mask them. Therefore, the possible phenotypes remain as before.\n\nGiven that, each phenotype occurs 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the user intended a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype compared to others. For example, the ratio of Checkered red to Checkered brown to Plain red to Plain brown. Since each phenotype is 25%, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But again, this isn't among the answer choices.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum 18\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum 12\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Same as F.\n\nHmm, none seem to fit exactly. But perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recount the probabilities.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has a 25% chance for each genotype. Each genotype maps to a phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Both Pigment and Body Present \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment Present, Body Absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Pigment Absent, Body Present \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Neither Present \u2192 Plain red\n\nEach of these has a 25% probability, so each phenotype occurs 25% of the time. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype relative to the others in terms of the number of possible genotypes. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to ask for the ratio of each phenotype to another, such as Checkered red to Checkered brown, which would be 1:1, but the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of possible phenotypic expressions, but that still doesn't align with the answer options. \n\nWait, perhaps the user mixed up the traits. Let me assume that the dominant allele for pigment is C, and for body color is B. Then, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. However, in reality, the recessive allele masks the dominant trait. So, if a bird has at least one C, it's red; else, it's plain. Similarly, if it has at least one B, it's brown; else, it's checkered. Thus, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, and the recessive alleles lead to the masking.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both Pigment and Body Present (Red and Brown)\n2. Pigment Present, Body Absent (Red and Checkered)\n3. Pigment Absent, Body Present (Plain Brown)\n4. Neither Present (Plain Red)\n\nEach of these occurs 25% of the time, leading to a ratio of 1:1:1:1. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio of the number of each phenotype in a different way, such as comparing each phenotype to itself or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to know the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to each other, not the overall ratio. For instance, the ratio of Checkered red to Checkered brown would be 1:1, but that's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering that each bird has two traits, leading to four possible phenotypes, each occurring equally, hence 1:1:1:1. But again, this isn't among the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is referring to the phenotypic ratios based on the number of possible genotypic combinations, not the phenotypic expression. In that case, each bird has a unique genotype, but some genotypes may result in the same phenotype. For example, CC BB and CC bb both result in Checkered red, contributing two individuals to the Checkered red phenotype. Similarly, CC bb and cc bb both contribute to Checkered brown, and so on. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 2:2:2:2, but normalized to the sum of 16, it becomes 1:1:1:1. Still, this isn't an option.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that each bird has two independent traits, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the combination of both traits, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, since this isn't an option, I might need to consider another approach. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio of Checkered red to plain red, considering only the presence of the dominant allele for pigment. Wait, no\u2014that would ignore the body color.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is confusing the dominance hierarchy. Let me consider that the recessive allele is dominant for one trait and recessive for another. For example, suppose that c (recessive for pigment) is dominant for body color, making all birds with at least one c have a certain phenotype, and B (recessive) is dominant for pigment, making all birds with at least one B have another phenotype. But this complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask for the ratio of Checkered red to plain red, ignoring body color. In that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: from CC BB and CC bb \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Plain red: from cc BB and cc bb \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nThus, the ratio would be 50:50, or simplified 1:1. But this is not reflected in the answer options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering that the presence of at least one dominant allele in each trait leads to that trait's manifestation, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the number of each trait. For example:\n\n- Both traits present \u2192 25%\n- Pigment present, body absent \u2192 25%\n- Pigment absent, body present \u2192 25%\n- Neither present \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But again, this isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I should revisit the Punnett square approach. Let's create a Punnett square for the F2 generation based on the F1 cross (CcBb x ccbb).\n\nThe F1 genotype is CcBb. When crossed with ccbb, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Cc x cc \u2192 Possible gametes: C (25%), c (75%)\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n\n- Bb x bb \u2192 Possible gametes: B (50%), b (50%)\n\nCombining these, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 (C x B) = CB, (C x b) = Cb, (c x B) = cB, (c x b) = cb\n\nBut since each parent contributes gametes, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% Ccbb\n- 25% ccBb\n- 25% ccbb\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb: Both dominant \u2192 Checkered red\n- Ccbb: Pigment present, body absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- ccBb: Pigment absent, body present \u2192 Plain brown\n- ccbb: Neither present \u2192 Plain red\n\nThus, the phen",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

So Option E lists them as 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which would correspond to A,B,C,D. But in terms of phenotype names, checkered red is D, checkered brown is B, plain red is A, plain brown is C. So the ratio would be D:B:A:C \u2192 3:9:1:3. But none of the options list them in that exact order. Wait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't fit\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches our earlier calculation, with 9 parts for A, 3 for B, 3 for C, 1 for D. So Phenotype A: 9, B:3, C:3, D:1. Translated into bird names: A is checkered red, B is checkered brown, C is plain red, D is plain brown. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But the options don't list this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options, option C states: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, I thought the probabilities were 9/16 for both traits, 3/16 for only C, 3/16 for only B, and 1/16 for neither. But if that's the case, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but option C says checkered red is 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that doesn't align with my calculations. Maybe I messed up the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to recalculate based on the actual genotypes. Let's create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc: For the C locus, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, cc\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb: For the B locus, the possible genotypes are BB, Bb, bb\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So the combined F2 genotypes will have combinations of these. But since we're interested in phenotypes, we can focus on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's build the Punnett square:\n\nC locus | B locus | Phenotype\n---|---|---\nCC | BB \u2192 C (red), B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\nCC | Bb \u2192 C red, B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\nCC | bb \u2192 C red, B (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\nCc | BB \u2192 C red, B brown \u2192 Checkered red\nCc | Bb \u2192 C red, B brown \u2192 Checkered red\nCc | bb \u2192 C red, B (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\ncc | BB \u2192 C (plain), B brown \u2192 Checkered brown\ncc | Bb \u2192 C (plain), B brown \u2192 Checkered brown\ncc | bb \u2192 C (plain), B (checkered) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Occurs when C is present and B is present. From the table, these are CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain red: Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain brown: cc bb \u2192 1 case\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:4:1. Simplifying, divide by common factor (1): 4:2:4:1 \u2192 Divide by 1: 4:2:4:1 \u2192 Wait, but 4+2+4+1=11, which doesn't add up to 16. That can't be right. I must have miscalculated.\n\nWait, no\u2014if I count each phenotype:\n\nCheckered red: All cases where both C and B are present \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\nCheckered brown: Cases where C is present but B is not \u2192 CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\nPlain red: Cases where C is not present but B is \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 4\nPlain brown: Case where neither C nor B is present \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 4+2+4+1=11, which is less than 16. That discrepancy suggests I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n5. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n7. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n8. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n9. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (4)\n10. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red (4)\n11. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n12. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n13. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n14. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n15. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (4)\n16. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red (4)\n17. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n18. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n19. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (4)\n20. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red (4)\n\nHmm, that's 20 cases. Wait, now I'm confused because I thought the Punnett square was 4x4, giving 16. Maybe I miscounted. Let me try again:\n\nThe F2 population is 16. Let me assign numbers to each cell:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 2\n3. Cc BB \u2192 3\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 4\n5. CC bb \u2192 5\n6. Cc bb \u2192 6\n7. Cc BB \u2192 7\n8. Cc Bb \u2192 8\n9. cc BB \u2192 9\n10. cc Bb \u219210\n11. CC bb \u219211\n12. Cc bb \u219212\n13. Cc BB \u219213\n14. Cc Bb \u219214\n15. cc BB \u219215\n16. cc Bb \u219216\n\nNow, categorizing:\n\n1,2,3,4 \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n5,6,7,8 \u2192 Checkered brown (4)\n9,10,11,12 \u2192 Plain red (4)\n13,14,15,16 \u2192 Plain brown (4)\n\nTotal: 4+4+4+4=16. So the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But this contradicts my previous thought process. How come?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The original problem mentions a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). The F2 generation refers to the cross between F1 and F1. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be from F1 x F1. So the Punnett square for F2 is indeed 16. Now, why did I get conflicting results earlier?\n\nAh, I realize the confusion arises from the fact that the F2 generation includes all possible combinations. However, the correct approach is to recognize that each gene segregates independently, leading to the F2 phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1. But in reality, when both genes are present, the phenotypic ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, which would translate to checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown as follows:\n\n- 9 parts: Checkered red\n- 3 parts: Checkered brown\n- 3 parts: Plain red\n- 1 part: Plain brown\n\nThis matches option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the ratios would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Ratios: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Which corresponds to Phenotype C : B : D : A \u2192 But according to our calculation, the order is A:B:C:D \u2192 Checkered red: Checkered brown: Plain red: Plain brown. So Option E lists them as 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which would correspond to A,B,C,D. But in terms of phenotype names, checkered red is D, checkered brown is B, plain red is A, plain brown is C. So the ratio would be D:B:A:C \u2192 3:9:1:3. But none of the options list them in that exact order. Wait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't fit\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches our earlier calculation, with 9 parts for A, 3 for B, 3 for C, 1 for D. So Phenotype A: 9, B:3, C:3, D:1. Translated into bird names: A is checkered red, B is checkered brown, C is plain red, D is plain brown. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But the options don't list this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options, option C states: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, I thought the probabilities were 9/16 for both traits, 3/16 for only C, 3/16 for only B, and 1/16 for neither. But if that's the case, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but option C says checkered red is 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that doesn't align with my calculations. Maybe I messed up the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to recalculate based on the actual genotypes. Let's create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb. The F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc: For the C locus, the possible genotypes are CC, Cc, cc\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb: For the B locus, the possible genotypes are BB, Bb, bb\n\nEach gene segregates independently. So the combined F2 genotypes will have combinations of these. But since we're interested in phenotypes, we can focus on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's build the Punnett square:\n\nC locus | B locus | Phenotype\n---|---|---\nCC | BB \u2192 C (red), B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\nCC | Bb \u2192 C red, B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\nCC | bb \u2192 C red, B (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\nCc | BB \u2192 C red, B brown \u2192 Checkered red\nCc | Bb \u2192 C red, B brown \u2192 Checkered red\nCc | bb \u2192 C red, B (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\ncc | BB \u2192 C (plain), B brown \u2192 Checkered brown\ncc | Bb \u2192 C (plain), B brown \u2192 Checkered brown\ncc | bb \u2192 C (plain), B (checkered) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Occurs when C is present and B is present. From the table, these are CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 cases\n- Checkered brown: CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain red: Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain brown: cc bb \u2192 1 case\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:4:1. Simplifying, divide by common factor (1): 4:2:4:1 \u2192 Divide by 1: 4:2:4:1 \u2192 Wait, but 4+2+4+1=11, which doesn't add up to 16. That can't be right. I must have miscalculated.\n\nWait, no\u2014if I count each phenotype:\n\nCheckered red: All cases where both C and B are present \u2192 CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4\nCheckered brown: Cases where C is present but B is not \u2192 CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2\nPlain red: Cases where C is not present but B is \u2192 Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 4\nPlain brown: Case where neither C nor B is present \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 4+2+4+1=11, which is less than 16. That discrepancy suggests I made a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n5. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n7. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n8. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n9. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (4)\n10. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red (4)\n11. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n12. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n13. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n14. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n15. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (4)\n16. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red (4)\n17. CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n18. Cc bb \u2192 Checkered brown (2)\n19. cc BB \u2192 Plain red (4)\n20. cc Bb \u2192 Plain red (4)\n\nHmm, that's 20 cases. Wait, now I'm confused because I thought the Punnett square was 4x4, giving 16. Maybe I miscounted. Let me try again:\n\nThe F2 population is 16. Let me assign numbers to each cell:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 2\n3. Cc BB \u2192 3\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 4\n5. CC bb \u2192 5\n6. Cc bb \u2192 6\n7. Cc BB \u2192 7\n8. Cc Bb \u2192 8\n9. cc BB \u2192 9\n10. cc Bb \u219210\n11. CC bb \u219211\n12. Cc bb \u219212\n13. Cc BB \u219213\n14. Cc Bb \u219214\n15. cc BB \u219215\n16. cc Bb \u219216\n\nNow, categorizing:\n\n1,2,3,4 \u2192 Checkered red (4)\n5,6,7,8 \u2192 Checkered brown (4)\n9,10,11,12 \u2192 Plain red (4)\n13,14,15,16 \u2192 Plain brown (4)\n\nTotal: 4+4+4+4=16. So the ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But this contradicts my previous thought process. How come?\n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. The original problem mentions a dihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). The F2 generation refers to the cross between F1 and F1. So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be from F1 x F1. So the Punnett square for F2 is indeed 16. Now, why did I get conflicting results earlier?\n\nAh, I realize the confusion arises from the fact that the F2 generation includes all possible combinations. However, the correct approach is to recognize that each gene segregates independently, leading to the F2 phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1. But in reality, when both genes are present, the phenotypic ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, which would translate to checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown as follows:\n\n- 9 parts: Checkered red\n- 3 parts: Checkered brown\n- 3 parts: Plain red\n- 1 part: Plain brown\n\nThis matches option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But according to our calculations, Phenotype A (both traits) would be 9, Phenotype B (only C) 3, Phenotype C (only B) 3, and Phenotype D (none) 1.",
    "rollout": " But according to our calculations, Phenotype A (both traits) would be 9, Phenotype B (only C) 3, Phenotype C (only B) 3, and Phenotype D (none) 1. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's the reverse of what we have. Because in our analysis, checkered red corresponds to Phenotype D (neither trait), which is 1 part, but in the options, it's listed as checkered red 3. Hmm, perhaps I've misassigned the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the roles of C and b. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant) \u2192 red\n                b (recessive) \u2192 plain\n- Body color: B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n                b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Both C and B \u2192 red and brown (Phenotype A)\n- C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Phenotype B)\n- C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown (Phenotype C)\n- Neither \u2192 plain and checkered (Phenotype D)\n\nOur previous probabilities were:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nNow, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nThus, the order would be Phenotype D (plain and checkered) : Phenotype C (plain and brown) : Phenotype B (red and checkered) : Phenotype A (red and brown) \u2192 1 : 3 : 3 : 9.\n\nLooking at the answer options, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which aligns with the 1:3:3:9 ratio, but in terms of the order of phenotypes as described in the question, perhaps the order is different. Wait, the question lists the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our ratio, checkered red is Phenotype D (plain and checkered), checkered brown is Phenotype C (plain and brown), plain red is Phenotype B (red and checkered), plain brown is Phenotype A (red and brown). So the order in the question matches the ratio as D:C:B:A \u2192 1:3:3:9. So the expected phenotypic ratio is checkered red (D) 1, checkered brown (C) 3, plain red (B) 3, plain brown (A) 9. But in the answer options, E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't match. Option E lists checkered red as 3, which would correspond to Phenotype D (1), not 3. So perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are ordered differently. Let me double-check:\n\nThe question lists the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our ratio, these correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype D (1)\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype C (3)\n- Plain red: Phenotype B (3)\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A (9)\n\nThus, the order in the answer options is D, C, B, A, which would mean the ratio is 1:3:3:9. None of the answer options seem to exactly match this without adjusting the numbers. Wait, let me look at the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would correspond to D:C:B:A \u2192 3:9:1:3, which is different from our 1:3:3:9. None of the options perfectly match 1:3:3:9, unless I've misunderstood the phenotypes. Maybe I assigned the phenotypes incorrectly. Let me try again.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of thinking in terms of the presence of dominant alleles leading to the respective traits, perhaps the phenotypes are defined as:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown: Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red and body checkered: Phenotype 2\n- Pigment checkered and body brown: Phenotype 3\n- Pigment checkered and body checkered: Phenotype 4\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities:\n\nFor Pigment red and body brown (Phenotype 1):\n\n- Probability of pigment red: 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of body brown: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n- Combined probability: 1*1=1\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Pigment red and body checkered (Phenotype 2): 1*1=1\n- Plain and body brown (Phenotype 3): 1 (for C recessive) *1=1\n- Plain and body checkered (Phenotype 4): 1 (for C recessive)*1=1\n\nThis can't be correct because it implies all birds have both traits, which isn't possible. So clearly, the issue is that each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes independently. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider all possible combinations, considering the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nEach gene has three possibilities for presence or absence (but since we're dealing with two traits, we need to consider the interaction). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct a Punnett square showing all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nLet me create a Punnett square for F2:\n\n       | C c | C c\n-------|---|---\n     B b | CcBB | CcBb |\n     B b | CcBB | CcBb |\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- ccBB: 25%\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- ccBB: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- ccBb: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 25%\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): 25%\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 25%\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right because the total would be 100%, but according to the standard Mendelian distribution, each of the four phenotypes would occur at 25%. But according to the given answer options, none of them match this 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered. So, for pigment color, C is dominant over c, and for body color, B is dominant over b. Therefore, the presence of C or B in any dominant form results in the respective trait. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But according to our calculations, Phenotype A (both traits) would be 9, Phenotype B (only C) 3, Phenotype C (only B) 3, and Phenotype D (none) 1. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the answer choices, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's the reverse of what we have. Because in our analysis, checkered red corresponds to Phenotype D (neither trait), which is 1 part, but in the options, it's listed as checkered red 3. Hmm, perhaps I've misassigned the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the definitions.\n\nWait, perhaps I mixed up the roles of C and b. Let me clarify:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant) \u2192 red\n                b (recessive) \u2192 plain\n- Body color: B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n                b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Both C and B \u2192 red and brown (Phenotype A)\n- C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered (Phenotype B)\n- C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown (Phenotype C)\n- Neither \u2192 plain and checkered (Phenotype D)\n\nOur previous probabilities were:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nNow, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nThus, the order would be Phenotype D (plain and checkered) : Phenotype C (plain and brown) : Phenotype B (red and checkered) : Phenotype A (red and brown) \u2192 1 : 3 : 3 : 9.\n\nLooking at the answer options, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which aligns with the 1:3:3:9 ratio, but in terms of the order of phenotypes as described in the question, perhaps the order is different. Wait, the question lists the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our ratio, checkered red is Phenotype D (plain and checkered), checkered brown is Phenotype C (plain and brown), plain red is Phenotype B (red and checkered), plain brown is Phenotype A (red and brown). So the order in the question matches the ratio as D:C:B:A \u2192 1:3:3:9. So the expected phenotypic ratio is checkered red (D) 1, checkered brown (C) 3, plain red (B) 3, plain brown (A) 9. But in the answer options, E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't match. Option E lists checkered red as 3, which would correspond to Phenotype D (1), not 3. So perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are ordered differently. Let me double-check:\n\nThe question lists the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our ratio, these correspond to:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype D (1)\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype C (3)\n- Plain red: Phenotype B (3)\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A (9)\n\nThus, the order in the answer options is D, C, B, A, which would mean the ratio is 1:3:3:9. None of the answer options seem to exactly match this without adjusting the numbers. Wait, let me look at the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would correspond to D:C:B:A \u2192 3:9:1:3, which is different from our 1:3:3:9. None of the options perfectly match 1:3:3:9, unless I've misunderstood the phenotypes. Maybe I assigned the phenotypes incorrectly. Let me try again.\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of thinking in terms of the presence of dominant alleles leading to the respective traits, perhaps the phenotypes are defined as:\n\n- Pigment red and body brown: Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red and body checkered: Phenotype 2\n- Pigment checkered and body brown: Phenotype 3\n- Pigment checkered and body checkered: Phenotype 4\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities:\n\nFor Pigment red and body brown (Phenotype 1):\n\n- Probability of pigment red: 1 (since any C gives red)\n- Probability of body brown: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n- Combined probability: 1*1=1\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Pigment red and body checkered (Phenotype 2): 1*1=1\n- Plain and body brown (Phenotype 3): 1 (for C recessive) *1=1\n- Plain and body checkered (Phenotype 4): 1 (for C recessive)*1=1\n\nThis can't be correct because it implies all birds have both traits, which isn't possible. So clearly, the issue is that each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes independently. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider all possible combinations, considering the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nEach gene has three possibilities for presence or absence (but since we're dealing with two traits, we need to consider the interaction). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to construct a Punnett square showing all possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nLet me create a Punnett square for F2:\n\n       | C c | C c\n-------|---|---\n     B b | CcBB | CcBb |\n     B b | CcBB | CcBb |\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB: 25%\n- CcBb: 50%\n- ccBB: 25%\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- ccBB: Plain (c), Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- ccBb: Plain (c), Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 25%\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): 25%\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 25%\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right because the total would be 100%, but according to the standard Mendelian distribution, each of the four phenotypes would occur at 25%. But according to the given answer options, none of them match this 1:1:1:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that red is dominant over plain, and brown is dominant over checkered. So, for pigment color, C is dominant over c, and for body color, B is dominant over b. Therefore, the presence of C or B in any dominant form results in the respective trait. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: Probability of C and B = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: Probability of C and b = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: Probability of c and B = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: Probability of c and b = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 parts of Phenotype A, 3 parts of B, 3 parts of C, and 1 part of D. Now, looking at the answer options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would correspond to D:C:B:A \u2192 1:3:3:9. However, our ratio is 9:3:3:1. So option E is inverted in terms of the order but still represents the correct ratio if we ignore the order. But in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, so the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, none of the answer options exactly match this.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nThis aligns with our calculation where:\n- Checkered red (which is plain and brown) corresponds to Phenotype D: 1 part\n- Checkered brown (red and checkered) corresponds to Phenotype B: 3 parts\n- Plain red (red and plain) corresponds to Phenotype C: 3 parts\n- Plain brown (checkered and brown) corresponds to Phenotype A: 9 parts\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in terms of each phenotype. So the order is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown \u2192 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But looking at the options, none exactly match this.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Wait, no\u2014the counts correspond to the parts I calculated: 1 part plain red, 3 plain brown, 9 red, 3 red brown. But looking at the options, option J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That would be 2+6+3+1=12, which doesn't match our 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u219216.

But looking at the options, the correct ratio should add up to 16. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.

However, the options don't include this exactly. Let me look back at the options provided. The options are labeled A through J, each giving a different ratio. \n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing to 16.

But without further context, I need to proceed based on standard Mendelian ratios. Another possibility is that the question refers to the number of birds with each trait, not the fraction of the population.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So option E says:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWhich corresponds to Phenotype D (plain red, 1 part), Phenotype C (plain brown, 3 parts), Phenotype B (red, 9 parts), Phenotype A (red brown, 3\u00d73=9 parts). Wait, no\u2014the counts correspond to the parts I calculated: 1 part plain red, 3 plain brown, 9 red, 3 red brown. But looking at the options, option J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That would be 2+6+3+1=12, which doesn't match our 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6\u219216. Let me recalculate. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the F2 generation should have 16 possible phenotypes, each with different combinations. But looking at the options, the correct ratio should add up to 16. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. For each bird, there are four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo for a large number of offspring, the ratio would be approximately 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D. However, the options don't include this exactly. Let me look back at the options provided. The options are labeled A through J, each giving a different ratio. \n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing to 16. But according to our calculations, there are no birds with neither trait present (Phenotype D). So option G is incorrect because it includes Phenotype D as zero. \n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This would imply each phenotype has 4 parts, totaling 16, but according to our calculations, Phenotype A is 9, B and C are 3 each, and D is 1. None of the options perfectly match, but option F is the closest, assuming that Phenotype D is zero, which contradicts our previous analysis. \n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio observed in the F2 generation without considering dominance, i.e., treating each trait as present regardless of dominance. But that wouldn't make sense because dominance affects the phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the actual counts, not the probabilities. But without further context, I need to proceed based on standard Mendelian ratios. Another possibility is that the question refers to the number of birds with each trait, not the fraction of the population.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

But looking at the options, option J states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's double what we have here. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, perhaps I've miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine the probabilities. The key is that each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, and the probabilities are as follows: \n\n- Both C and B present: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nThus, the number of each phenotype in a population of N individuals would be:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 9N/16\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3N/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3N/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): N/16\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Summing to 16.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb?

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the numbers would be:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype C): 1 part \u2192 1 unit\n- Checkered brown (phenotype B): 3 parts \u2192 3 units\n- Plain red (phenotype A): 9 parts \u2192 9 units\n- Plain brown (phenotype D): 3 parts \u2192 3 units\n\nTherefore, the expected ratio is 1 : 3 : 9 : 3. But looking at the options, option J states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That's double what we have here. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Hmm, perhaps I've miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me re-examine the probabilities. The key is that each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits, and the probabilities are as follows: \n\n- Both C and B present: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nThus, the number of each phenotype in a population of N individuals would be:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 9N/16\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3N/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3N/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): N/16\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Summing to 16. This corresponds to phenotypes C (3), B (9), A (1), D (3). Which matches our calculations.\n\nSo the correct ratio is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.",
    "rollout": " Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This aligns perfectly with our calculations: 3 for plain red, 9 for checkered brown, 1 for plain red, and 3 for checkered brown. Wait, no, hold on\u2014the pheno counts in option E are 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to our 1,3,3,9. So option E is correct. Alternatively, looking at the user's options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which would correspond to 3:3:3:1, but our calculation shows 1:3:3:9. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits (A): 9/16\n- Only C (B): 3/16\n- Only B (C): 3/16\n- Neither (D): 1/16\n\nSo if we take N=16 birds, the counts would be:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But the options don't list this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would mean 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That doesn't align with our 9 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. So perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Maybe checkered red refers to the presence of both genes in a recessive manner, i.e., cc BB? No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the letters are reversed. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the problem statement:\n\n- C: pigment color (dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain)\n- B: color (dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered)\n\nSo, when both are recessive, it's plain and checkered.\n\nWhen one is recessive and the other dominant, it's the dominant trait plus the recessive one. So:\n\n- C dominant, b recessive \u2192 red and checkered (phenotype C, bb)\n- c recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown (phenotype cc, BB)\n- C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red and brown (phenotype CC, BB)\n- c recessive, b recessive \u2192 plain and checkered (phenotype cc, bb)\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC (red): 3/4 chance\n- Cc (pigeon): 1/4 chance\n- bb (plain): 1/4 chance\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB (brown): 3/4 chance\n- Bb (brown): 1/4 chance\n- bb (checkered): 1/4 chance\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. The phenotypic classes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- C present, B absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C absent, B present \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Neither present \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which in terms of numbers would be 9 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Now, looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's the reverse of what we have. Our calculation shows 9 checkered brown and 3 checkered red, while option E has 3 checkered red and 9 checkered brown. So option E is inverted. Therefore, option E is incorrect.\n\nLooking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This aligns perfectly with our calculations: 3 for plain red, 9 for checkered brown, 1 for plain red, and 3 for checkered brown. Wait, no, hold on\u2014the pheno counts in option E are 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to our 1,3,3,9. So option E is correct. Alternatively, looking at the user's options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which would correspond to 3:3:3:1, but our calculation shows 1:3:3:9. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The probabilities are:\n\n- Both traits (A): 9/16\n- Only C (B): 3/16\n- Only B (C): 3/16\n- Neither (D): 1/16\n\nSo if we take N=16 birds, the counts would be:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But the options don't list this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would mean 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That doesn't align with our 9 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. So perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Maybe checkered red refers to the presence of both genes in a recessive manner, i.e., cc BB? No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the letters are reversed. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the problem statement:\n\n- C: pigment color (dominant C \u2192 red, recessive c \u2192 plain)\n- B: color (dominant B \u2192 brown, recessive b \u2192 checkered)\n\nSo, when both are recessive, it's plain and checkered.\n\nWhen one is recessive and the other dominant, it's the dominant trait plus the recessive one. So:\n\n- C dominant, b recessive \u2192 red and checkered (phenotype C, bb)\n- c recessive, B dominant \u2192 plain and brown (phenotype cc, BB)\n- C dominant, B dominant \u2192 red and brown (phenotype CC, BB)\n- c recessive, b recessive \u2192 plain and checkered (phenotype cc, bb)\n\nNow, the probabilities are:\n\n- CC (red): 3/4 chance\n- Cc (pigeon): 1/4 chance\n- bb (plain): 1/4 chance\n\nSimilarly for B:\n\n- BB (brown): 3/4 chance\n- Bb (brown): 1/4 chance\n- bb (checkered): 1/4 chance\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. The phenotypic classes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- C present, B absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- C absent, B present \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Neither present \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which in terms of numbers would be 9 checkered brown, 3 checkered red, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Now, looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's the reverse of what we have. Our calculation shows 9 checkered brown and 3 checkered red, while option E has 3 checkered red and 9 checkered brown. So option E is inverted. Therefore, option E is incorrect.\n\nLooking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Simplified to 3:1:3:1\n\nB.

Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nOur correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Hmm, none of the options exactly match our expectation unless I've mixed up the phenotypes.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nOur calculation shows a ratio of 1:3:3:9.

Let me check again: \n\nPhenotype A: Both present \u2192 red and brown (count 9)\n\nPhenotype B: Only C \u2192 red and checkered (count 3)\n\nPhenotype C: Only B \u2192 plain and brown (count 3)\n\nPhenotype D: Neither \u2192 plain and checkered (count 1)\n\nSo the ratio is 1:3:3:9, which corresponds to option C (9,3,3,1) if we list them in order. But in reality, the first category is plain red (D), then plain brown (A), then checkered red (B), then checkered brown (C). So the ratio is D:A:B:C \u2192 1:9:3:3, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the order in the options is different. Option C lists 9,3,3,1, which would correspond to A:B:C:D as 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. Because our Pheno A is D (plain and checkered: 1 unit), B is C (only B: 3 units), C is B (only C: 3 units), D is A (both:9 units). So option C: 9,3,3,1 would represent D:A:B:C, which aligns with our calculations. However, the options don't include this exact phrasing. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented in a different order.

But in the options, it's written as \"9,3,3,1\", which is option C. However, sometimes the order matters depending on how the phenotypes are defined. If the phenotypes are ordered as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, then the ratio would be 1,3,9,3, which is option D. But according to our earlier reasoning, the correct order should follow the phenotypic expression hierarchy, starting from the most specific to the most inclusive. So perhaps the correct order is plain red (D), plain brown (A), checkered red (B), checkered brown (C), giving a ratio of 1:9:3:3, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented without explicit ordering, making it ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me re-examine the probabilities. Another approach is to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. For the C locus: presence (red), absence (plain); for the B locus: presence (brown), absence (checkered). So the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype:\n\nFor a bird, the probability of C present is 3/4 (since any bird with at least one C allele will be red). Similarly, the probability of B present is 3/4. Since the two events are independent, the probability of both being present is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16. The probability of only C present is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16. The probability of neither is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nA: 9/16\n\nB: 3/16\n\nC: 3/16\n\nD: 1/16\n\nThus, the total ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. So the correct answer should be option C, where the phenotypic ratio is 9,3,3,1, representing checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But let me double-check: checkered red would be phenotype D (both absent), which is 1 part, so 1 unit. Checkered brown is B (only C present): 3 units. Plain red is C (only B present): 3 units. Plain brown is A (both present): 9 units. So the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:9. Now, looking at the answer choices:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn\u2019t fit\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn\u2019t fit\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This is the inverse of what we have.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 This is the reverse order of what we expect.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 This is the same as C, just reversed. Hmm, none of the options exactly match our expectation unless I've mixed up the phenotypes.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014the options are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nOur calculation shows a ratio of 1:3:3:9. None of the options directly state this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the reciprocal. Maybe I misassigned the phenotypes. Let me check again: \n\nPhenotype A: Both present \u2192 red and brown (count 9)\n\nPhenotype B: Only C \u2192 red and checkered (count 3)\n\nPhenotype C: Only B \u2192 plain and brown (count 3)\n\nPhenotype D: Neither \u2192 plain and checkered (count 1)\n\nSo the ratio is 1:3:3:9, which corresponds to option C (9,3,3,1) if we list them in order. But in reality, the first category is plain red (D), then plain brown (A), then checkered red (B), then checkered brown (C). So the ratio is D:A:B:C \u2192 1:9:3:3, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the order in the options is different. Option C lists 9,3,3,1, which would correspond to A:B:C:D as 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. Because our Pheno A is D (plain and checkered: 1 unit), B is C (only B: 3 units), C is B (only C: 3 units), D is A (both:9 units). So option C: 9,3,3,1 would represent D:A:B:C, which aligns with our calculations. However, the options don't include this exact phrasing. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented in a different order. Let me look again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nIn the question, the user wrote:\n\n\"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\"\n\nThen listed the options as A through J, and the user asks to select the correct answer with only a single letter.\n\nGiven that, according to our analysis, the correct ratio is 1:3:3:9, which would correspond to option C (9,3,3,1). But in the options, it's written as \"9,3,3,1\", which is option C. However, sometimes the order matters depending on how the phenotypes are defined. If the phenotypes are ordered as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, then the ratio would be 1,3,9,3, which is option D. But according to our earlier reasoning, the correct order should follow the phenotypic expression hierarchy, starting from the most specific to the most inclusive. So perhaps the correct order is plain red (D), plain brown (A), checkered red (B), checkered brown (C), giving a ratio of 1:9:3:3, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented without explicit ordering, making it ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me re-examine the probabilities. Another approach is to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. For the C locus: presence (red), absence (plain); for the B locus: presence (brown), absence (checkered). So the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype:\n\nFor a bird, the probability of C present is 3/4 (since any bird with at least one C allele will be red). Similarly, the probability of B present is 3/4. Since the two events are independent, the probability of both being present is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16. The probability of only C present is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16. The probability of neither is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\nA: 9/16\n\nB: 3/16\n\nC: 3/16\n\nD: 1/16\n\nThus, the total ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. So the correct answer should be option C, where the phenotypic ratio is 9,3,3,1, representing checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So according to this, the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:9. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.

Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So checking the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nYes, this matches our calculation where 3 correspond to plain red ( phenotype D ), 9 to checkered brown ( phenotype B ), 1 to plain red ( phenotype C ), and 3 to checkered brown ( phenotype B ). Wait, no, in our breakdown, phenotype B was 3/16, which corresponds to 3 offspring out of 16. Similarly, phenotype C was 3/16, and phenotype D was 1/16. Option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which aligns exactly with our calculations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds exactly to Phenotype D (plain and checkered) as 1 part, Phenotype B (red and checkered) as 3 parts, Phenotype C (red and brown) as 3 parts, and Phenotype A (both red and brown) as 9 parts. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. So looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nB.8,4,0,4\u2192 Incorrect.\n\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192 This would mean checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But according to our calculations, Phenotype A (both traits) is 9, Phenotype B (only C) is 3, Phenotype C (only B) is 3, Phenotype D (none) is 1. But the options don't have a distribution like that. Instead, the options list different phenotypic ratios without breaking down into individual classes. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16, but this is the count for each phenotype, which doesn't align with our 9,3,3,1.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't add up to 16, and some classes are missing.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This seems to fit exactly with our calculation.\n\nSo the correct phenotypic ratio for F2 is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That aligns perfectly with our calculations. Because:\n- Checkered red corresponds to Phenotype D (neither C nor B present), which is 1/16.\n- Checkered brown corresponds to Phenotype B (only C present), which is 3/16.\n- Plain red corresponds to Phenotype C (only B present), which is 3/16.\n- Plain brown corresponds to Phenotype A (both C and B present), which is 9/16.\n\nSo the F2 generation would have the following phenotypic distribution: \n- Checkered red: 3 out of 16\n- Checkered brown: 9 out of 16\n- Plain red: 3 out of 16\n- Plain brown: 9 out of 16\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option E states exactly this.

That doesn't add up to 16. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That also doesn't fit. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds to 5+3+2+6=16. Hmm, but according to our calculations, the distribution should be 1:3:3:9. So option J is closest, but it's scaled down by a factor of 2. Wait, but the user provided answer choices, and among them, option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which aligns with our 1:3:3:9 distribution scaled by a factor of 3. But that's not exactly matching. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct distribution is 1/16 for D, 3/16 for B, 3/16 for C, and 9/16 for A. So if we take 16 parts, the numbers would be:\n\n- D: 1\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- A: 9\n\nThus, if we scale appropriately, the counts would be 1:3:3:9. Among the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't match. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't match. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't match. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equally distributed. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which doesn't fit. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which doesn't fit. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16 but doesn't follow the 1:3:3:9 ratio. Option D is 1:1:3:9, which sums to 14, but the distribution is different. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the 1:3:3:9 ratio. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't fit. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which doesn't fit. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equally divided but doesn't fit the 1:3:3:9 ratio. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Let me try another approach. The correct distribution should be:\n\n- Both traits present (A): 9/16\n- Only C (B): 3/16\n- Only B (C): 3/16\n- Neither (D): 1/16\n\nSo if we assume a population size that's a multiple of 16, say 16, the counts would be 9:3:3:1. However, the options don't provide this exact distribution. The closest is option E, which scales down the counts by a factor of 16/1=16, giving 3:9:1:3, which doesn't match 9:3:3:1. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't fit. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which doesn't fit. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equally divided but doesn't fit the required ratio. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which doesn't fit. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which doesn't fit.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So in terms of numbers: Checkered red (which corresponds to phenotype D) would be 1 part, so 1 unit. Plain red (phenotype A) would be 9 units. Checkered brown (B) is 3 units, and plain brown (C) is also 3 units. But looking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't add up to 16. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That also doesn't fit. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds to 5+3+2+6=16. Hmm, but according to our calculations, the distribution should be 1:3:3:9. So option J is closest, but it's scaled down by a factor of 2. Wait, but the user provided answer choices, and among them, option E is \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which aligns with our 1:3:3:9 distribution scaled by a factor of 3. But that's not exactly matching. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-examine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct distribution is 1/16 for D, 3/16 for B, 3/16 for C, and 9/16 for A. So if we take 16 parts, the numbers would be:\n\n- D: 1\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- A: 9\n\nThus, if we scale appropriately, the counts would be 1:3:3:9. Among the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't match. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't match. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't match. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equally distributed. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which doesn't fit. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which doesn't fit. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16 but doesn't follow the 1:3:3:9 ratio. Option D is 1:1:3:9, which sums to 14, but the distribution is different. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the 1:3:3:9 ratio. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't fit. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which doesn't fit. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equally divided but doesn't fit the 1:3:3:9 ratio. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Let me try another approach. The correct distribution should be:\n\n- Both traits present (A): 9/16\n- Only C (B): 3/16\n- Only B (C): 3/16\n- Neither (D): 1/16\n\nSo if we assume a population size that's a multiple of 16, say 16, the counts would be 9:3:3:1. However, the options don't provide this exact distribution. The closest is option E, which scales down the counts by a factor of 16/1=16, giving 3:9:1:3, which doesn't match 9:3:3:1. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which also doesn't fit. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which doesn't fit. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equally divided but doesn't fit the required ratio. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which doesn't fit. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which doesn't fit. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16 but doesn't fit the 1:3:3:9 ratio. Option D is 1:1:3:9, which doesn't fit. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't fit. Option J is 2:6:3:1, which doesn't fit.

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This corresponds to Phenotype C (plain red) 1, Phenotype B (checkered red) 3, Phenotype A (red brown) 9, Phenotype D (plain brown) 3. Wait, no, according to our earlier breakdown, Phenotype A is red brown, Phenotype B is red checkered, Phenotype C is plain brown, and Phenotype D is plain checkered. So the numbers should be: A=9, B=3, C=3, D=1. But Option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, plain brown as 3. That would correspond to Phenotype B (checkered red) 3, Phenotype A (red brown) 9, Phenotype C (plain brown) 1, Phenotype D (plain checkered) 3. Hmm, but that's inconsistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the mapping. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype A: red brown (C and B present)\nPhenotype B: red checkered (C present, B absent)\nPhenotype C: plain brown (C absent, B present)\nPhenotype D: plain checkered (C and B absent)\n\nSo, the counts would be:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

But Option E does exactly that. So why did I initially think of Phenotype A as red brown?\n\nAh, perhaps I had the order wrong.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Let me look at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWhich corresponds exactly to our calculations: 3 (phenotype B), 9 (phenotype A), 1 (phenotype D), 3 (phenotype C). So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, but wait, that's the counts, but the options list the phenotypes in order: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So the order in the options is checkered red first, then checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. Our calculation shows that checkered red (phenotype B) has 3, checkered brown (A) has 9, plain red (D) has 1, and plain brown (C) has 3. So the order in the options is correct.

Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the counts would be: - Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1",
    "rollout": " So the counts would be: - Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nWait, but according to our previous breakdown, the phenotypic classes are:\n1. Both traits present: 9/16\n2. Only C: 3/16\n3. Only B: 3/16\n4. Neither: 1/16\n\nSo the counts would be approximately 9, 3, 3, 1 in a population of 16. However, looking back at the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with our calculations. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, why do I get 9, 3, 3, 1? Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the F2 generation isn't exactly following a simple Mendelian ratio because the parents are homozygous for both genes. So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 would have different probabilities. Wait, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would have a 25% chance of each of the four possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, converting these genotypes into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigmented red (C present), Brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: Pigmented red (C present), Brown (B absent) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc: Plain (c present), Brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- bb: Plain (c present), Checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25%\n- Phenotype B: 25%\n- Phenotype C: 25%\n- Phenotype D: 25%\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because the presence of dominant alleles isn't independent in terms of the combined probabilities. Wait, no\u2014the presence of each dominant allele is independent, so the probability of having both dominant traits is indeed 25%, and similarly for each. So each phenotype has a 25% probability. But when counting the number of birds, each phenotype would have approximately 25% of the total offspring. However, the options don't seem to reflect this unless I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, no\u2014the checkered pattern is determined by C (dominant), and the color is determined by B (dominant). Wait, no, that's not correct. The checkered pattern is determined by C, which is recessive (since it's checked), while the color is determined by B, which is dominant (brown). Wait, no\u2014the problem states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the dominant color is brown (B), and the recessive is checkered (b). Wait, no\u2014that's reversed. Because typically, the dominant allele is represented by uppercase letters and the recessive by lowercase. So, if B is dominant, then the phenotype associated with B is brown, and the recessive is checkered. So, the color determination is:\n\n- Brown: B is present (at least one dominant allele)\n- Checkered: b is present (recessive)\n\nSimilarly, pigment color:\n\n- Red: C is present (dominant)\n- Plain: c is present (recessive)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Brown and Red: B present and C present\n2. Brown and Plain: B present and c absent\n3. Checkered and Red: b present and C present\n4. Checkered and Plain: b present and c absent\n\nEach of these is a distinct phenotype. Now, the F2 generation will have a certain distribution among these four phenotypes. To calculate the exact ratio, I need to look at the possible gametes and their combinations.\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb), the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at a 50% rate. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes and phenotypes:\n\nFor each F2 bird:\n\n- 25% CC (C present, B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Brown and Red\n- 25% Cc (C present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Brown and Plain\n- 25% cc (c present, B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Checkered and Red\n- 25% bb (c present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Checkered and Plain\n\nSince all four phenotypes are equally likely (each at 25%), the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But this contradicts the answer choices. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance relationships.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem specifies that C is dominant for pigment, and B is dominant for color. So:\n\n- For pigment (Red/Brown): C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele is red.\n- For color (Brown/Checkered): B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele is brown.\n\nTherefore, a bird can be:\n\n- Both red and brown (if C and B are present)\n- Red and checkered (if C is present, B absent)\n- Checkered and red (if B present, C absent)\n- Checkered and checkered (if neither C nor B is present)\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of these four phenotypes would occur with equal frequency (25% each), leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the answer options reflect this. Instead, the options suggest different distributions. Perhaps I need to reconsider the genetic ratios based on independent assortment.\n\nAnother approach is to use a Punnett square for F2 when crossing CcBb x CcBb, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's under the assumption of independent genes. Wait, no\u2014the 9:3:3:1 comes from three independently assorting genes, but here we have two genes. So, the F2 ratio for a dihybrid cross (two linked or independent genes) would differ.\n\nIf the two genes are linked and affect each other (i.e., they are on the same chromosome and affect each other's expression), the phenotypic ratios would not follow a 9:3:3:1 pattern but instead would be affected by co-inheritance. However, without knowing if the genes are linked or independent, it's difficult to proceed. Assuming they are independent, the phenotypic ratio would still be 1:1:1:1, but the answer options don't include such a choice.\n\nWait, going back to the initial problem statement, perhaps the key lies in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Since C is dominant for pigment (so C\u2192Red, c\u2192plain), and B is dominant for color (B\u2192brown, b\u2192checkered), the phenotypic classes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits (Red and Brown)\n2. Pigment Red (but not Brown)\n3. Color Checkered (but not Red)\n4. Neither trait\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment (Red/Pigment):\n\n- Presence of C: 3/4\n- Absence of C: 1/4\n\nFor color (Brown/Color):\n\n- Presence of B: 3/4\n- Absence of B: 1/4\n\nSince these are independent, the probability of both traits being present is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nOnly pigment Red: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nOnly Color Checkered: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nNeither trait: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer options reflect this exactly. Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of C in pigment and B in color are independent, but each may influence the other. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nThis corresponds to a 3:9:1:5 ratio, which doesn't fit our calculation. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems unrelated. Option J is 2:6:3:9, which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Let me reread it again:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Here's a crucial point: the problem specifies that C is dominant for pigment (so C\u2192Red, c\u2192plain), and B is dominant for color (B\u2192brown, b\u2192checkered). But in reality, the dominance hierarchy might mean that the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't necessarily ensure the presence in the other. Or perhaps it's a matter of epistasis, where one gene masks the effect of another. However, the problem doesn't mention anything about epistasis, so I'll assume independence.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since the options don't include this, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where both genes are affecting the same trait, leading to a different outcome. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in each gene results in different colors and patterns, but the inheritance is such that the phenotypes are determined by both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the two genes are on the same chromosome and are affecting each other, making them linked. In that case, the 9:3:3:1 ratio would collapse into a different pattern. However, without knowledge of the map distance or the degree of linkage, it's hard to apply the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the possible combinations of the two genes, ignoring the dominance hierarchy beyond what's stated. In that case, each bird can have four possible combinations of C and B:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Red and Checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nAssuming each combination is equally likely, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, the answer options don't have this, so perhaps the intended approach is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of the number of checkered versus non-checkered birds, and similarly for red vs. plain. For instance, checkered (c) and non-checkered (non-c) would have a ratio of 1:3 (since c: (C + B)), and similarly, red (C) and plain (c) would have a ratio of 3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". This aligns with a 3:9:1:5 ratio, which doesn't fit our earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the F2 generation includes both the effects of the two genes and the fact that some phenotypes are more common due to the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the F2 generation for a dihybrid cross (two independent genes) would yield a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but here we have two traits, each with three phenotypes, leading to nine phenotypic categories, which isn't realistic. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the genes are influencing each other, leading to a simplified ratio.\n\nHowever, without further information, I'm stuck. But looking at the options, option E seems to represent a 3:9:1:5 ratio, which doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another possibility: if the presence of dominant alleles in both genes leads to a particular phenotype. For example, if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown. If it has C and b, it's red and checkered. If it has c and B, it's plain and brown. If it has c and b, it's plain and checkered. So the four phenotypes are as before, each occurring with 25% probability, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, none of the answer options match this, so perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the problem is about the ratio of checkered to non-checkered, and red to plain. For example, in the F2 generation, the percentage of checkered (c) is 25% (for cc) plus 50% (for cb) times 2 (since both C and B can be present) plus 25% (for CB). Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each bird's checkered status depends on at least one 'c' allele. So the checkered phenotype occurs when either C or B is recessive. So the percentage of checkered birds is 100% minus the percentage of non-checkered (which is plain, and thus both C and B are present).\n\nSo, the checkered phenotype (c) occurs in 75% of the time (1/4 + 2/4), and the plain (C and B present) occurs in 25%. But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply a ratio of 3:9:1:5, which isn't standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in one gene affects the expression of the other. For example, if a bird has a dominant B allele, it's always brown, regardless of C. That would change the phenotypes to:\n\n1. Brown and Red (B present, C present)\n2. Brown and Plain (B present, C absent)\n3. Red and Plain (B absent, C present)\n4. Plain and Plain (B and C absent)\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the F2 would have:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Brown and Red (B and C present)\n- Phenotype 2: Brown and Plain (B present, C absent)\n- Phenotype 3: Red and Plain (B absent, C present)\n- Phenotype 4: Plain and Plain (neither present)\n\nThe probabilities for each:\n\n- Phenotype 1: B and C present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: B present, C absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: B absent, C present \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: neither \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but again, none of the options match this. However, if the problem is considering that B is dominant for color and C is dominant for pigment, but the presence of C doesn't affect color and vice versa, then the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nGiven that, and the options provided, the closest matching option is E, which lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This would correspond to a 3:9:1:5 ratio, which doesn't fit our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly phrased, and the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Let's clarify:\n\n- C is dominant for pigment \u2192 any C allele leads to red pigment, regardless of B.\n- B is dominant for color \u2192 any B allele leads to brown color, regardless of C.\n\nThus, a bird can have:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nEach of these four phenotypes occurs with equal frequency (25% each), leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. None of the options reflect this, so perhaps the intended answer is E, which might be derived from a different reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in both genes leads to a certain phenotype, overriding others. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in pigment and at least one dominant allele in color, it's considered a certain phenotype, and otherwise, it's a different one.\n\nBut without clear instructions, it's challenging. Given the options, option E seems to suggest a 3:9:1:5 ratio, which doesn't align with our analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and treat the two genes independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's not reflected in the options either.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the most plausible answer, despite discrepancies, is option E, as it reflects a balanced distribution across the phenotypes, though strictly speaking, it's not a standard 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps the problem assumes that",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the counts would be: - Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nWait, but according to our previous breakdown, the phenotypic classes are:\n1. Both traits present: 9/16\n2. Only C: 3/16\n3. Only B: 3/16\n4. Neither: 1/16\n\nSo the counts would be approximately 9, 3, 3, 1 in a population of 16. However, looking back at the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with our calculations. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, why do I get 9, 3, 3, 1? Maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the F2 generation isn't exactly following a simple Mendelian ratio because the parents are homozygous for both genes. So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 would have different probabilities. Wait, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would have a 25% chance of each of the four possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 will have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, converting these genotypes into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigmented red (C present), Brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: Pigmented red (C present), Brown (B absent) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc: Plain (c present), Brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- bb: Plain (c present), Checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25%\n- Phenotype B: 25%\n- Phenotype C: 25%\n- Phenotype D: 25%\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because the presence of dominant alleles isn't independent in terms of the combined probabilities. Wait, no\u2014the presence of each dominant allele is independent, so the probability of having both dominant traits is indeed 25%, and similarly for each. So each phenotype has a 25% probability. But when counting the number of birds, each phenotype would have approximately 25% of the total offspring. However, the options don't seem to reflect this unless I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read it again: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" Wait, no\u2014the checkered pattern is determined by C (dominant), and the color is determined by B (dominant). Wait, no, that's not correct. The checkered pattern is determined by C, which is recessive (since it's checked), while the color is determined by B, which is dominant (brown). Wait, no\u2014the problem states: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, the dominant color is brown (B), and the recessive is checkered (b). Wait, no\u2014that's reversed. Because typically, the dominant allele is represented by uppercase letters and the recessive by lowercase. So, if B is dominant, then the phenotype associated with B is brown, and the recessive is checkered. So, the color determination is:\n\n- Brown: B is present (at least one dominant allele)\n- Checkered: b is present (recessive)\n\nSimilarly, pigment color:\n\n- Red: C is present (dominant)\n- Plain: c is present (recessive)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Brown and Red: B present and C present\n2. Brown and Plain: B present and c absent\n3. Checkered and Red: b present and C present\n4. Checkered and Plain: b present and c absent\n\nEach of these is a distinct phenotype. Now, the F2 generation will have a certain distribution among these four phenotypes. To calculate the exact ratio, I need to look at the possible gametes and their combinations.\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb), the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at a 50% rate. When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes and phenotypes:\n\nFor each F2 bird:\n\n- 25% CC (C present, B present) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Brown and Red\n- 25% Cc (C present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Brown and Plain\n- 25% cc (c present, B present) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Checkered and Red\n- 25% bb (c present, B absent) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Checkered and Plain\n\nSince all four phenotypes are equally likely (each at 25%), the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But this contradicts the answer choices. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance relationships.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem specifies that C is dominant for pigment, and B is dominant for color. So:\n\n- For pigment (Red/Brown): C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele is red.\n- For color (Brown/Checkered): B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele is brown.\n\nTherefore, a bird can be:\n\n- Both red and brown (if C and B are present)\n- Red and checkered (if C is present, B absent)\n- Checkered and red (if B present, C absent)\n- Checkered and checkered (if neither C nor B is present)\n\nIn the F2 generation, each of these four phenotypes would occur with equal frequency (25% each), leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the answer options reflect this. Instead, the options suggest different distributions. Perhaps I need to reconsider the genetic ratios based on independent assortment.\n\nAnother approach is to use a Punnett square for F2 when crossing CcBb x CcBb, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's under the assumption of independent genes. Wait, no\u2014the 9:3:3:1 comes from three independently assorting genes, but here we have two genes. So, the F2 ratio for a dihybrid cross (two linked or independent genes) would differ.\n\nIf the two genes are linked and affect each other (i.e., they are on the same chromosome and affect each other's expression), the phenotypic ratios would not follow a 9:3:3:1 pattern but instead would be affected by co-inheritance. However, without knowing if the genes are linked or independent, it's difficult to proceed. Assuming they are independent, the phenotypic ratio would still be 1:1:1:1, but the answer options don't include such a choice.\n\nWait, going back to the initial problem statement, perhaps the key lies in understanding the dominance hierarchy. Since C is dominant for pigment (so C\u2192Red, c\u2192plain), and B is dominant for color (B\u2192brown, b\u2192checkered), the phenotypic classes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each trait.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both traits (Red and Brown)\n2. Pigment Red (but not Brown)\n3. Color Checkered (but not Red)\n4. Neither trait\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment (Red/Pigment):\n\n- Presence of C: 3/4\n- Absence of C: 1/4\n\nFor color (Brown/Color):\n\n- Presence of B: 3/4\n- Absence of B: 1/4\n\nSince these are independent, the probability of both traits being present is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n\nOnly pigment Red: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n\nOnly Color Checkered: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n\nNeither trait: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratios are 9:3:3:1. But none of the answer options reflect this exactly. Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of C in pigment and B in color are independent, but each may influence the other. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nThis corresponds to a 3:9:1:5 ratio, which doesn't fit our calculation. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also doesn't fit. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems unrelated. Option J is 2:6:3:9, which doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Let me reread it again:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Here's a crucial point: the problem specifies that C is dominant for pigment (so C\u2192Red, c\u2192plain), and B is dominant for color (B\u2192brown, b\u2192checkered). But in reality, the dominance hierarchy might mean that the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't necessarily ensure the presence in the other. Or perhaps it's a matter of epistasis, where one gene masks the effect of another. However, the problem doesn't mention anything about epistasis, so I'll assume independence.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but since the options don't include this, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where both genes are affecting the same trait, leading to a different outcome. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in each gene results in different colors and patterns, but the inheritance is such that the phenotypes are determined by both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering that the two genes are on the same chromosome and are affecting each other, making them linked. In that case, the 9:3:3:1 ratio would collapse into a different pattern. However, without knowledge of the map distance or the degree of linkage, it's hard to apply the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the phenotypic ratio based on the possible combinations of the two genes, ignoring the dominance hierarchy beyond what's stated. In that case, each bird can have four possible combinations of C and B:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Red and Brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Red and Checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Plain and Brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nAssuming each combination is equally likely, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, the answer options don't have this, so perhaps the intended approach is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of the number of checkered versus non-checkered birds, and similarly for red vs. plain. For instance, checkered (c) and non-checkered (non-c) would have a ratio of 1:3 (since c: (C + B)), and similarly, red (C) and plain (c) would have a ratio of 3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options, option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". This aligns with a 3:9:1:5 ratio, which doesn't fit our earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the F2 generation includes both the effects of the two genes and the fact that some phenotypes are more common due to the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the F2 generation for a dihybrid cross (two independent genes) would yield a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but here we have two traits, each with three phenotypes, leading to nine phenotypic categories, which isn't realistic. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes that the genes are influencing each other, leading to a simplified ratio.\n\nHowever, without further information, I'm stuck. But looking at the options, option E seems to represent a 3:9:1:5 ratio, which doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another possibility: if the presence of dominant alleles in both genes leads to a particular phenotype. For example, if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown. If it has C and b, it's red and checkered. If it has c and B, it's plain and brown. If it has c and b, it's plain and checkered. So the four phenotypes are as before, each occurring with 25% probability, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, none of the answer options match this, so perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the problem is about the ratio of checkered to non-checkered, and red to plain. For example, in the F2 generation, the percentage of checkered (c) is 25% (for cc) plus 50% (for cb) times 2 (since both C and B can be present) plus 25% (for CB). Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Each bird's checkered status depends on at least one 'c' allele. So the checkered phenotype occurs when either C or B is recessive. So the percentage of checkered birds is 100% minus the percentage of non-checkered (which is plain, and thus both C and B are present).\n\nSo, the checkered phenotype (c) occurs in 75% of the time (1/4 + 2/4), and the plain (C and B present) occurs in 25%. But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply a ratio of 3:9:1:5, which isn't standard. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in one gene affects the expression of the other. For example, if a bird has a dominant B allele, it's always brown, regardless of C. That would change the phenotypes to:\n\n1. Brown and Red (B present, C present)\n2. Brown and Plain (B present, C absent)\n3. Red and Plain (B absent, C present)\n4. Plain and Plain (B and C absent)\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So, the F2 would have:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Brown and Red (B and C present)\n- Phenotype 2: Brown and Plain (B present, C absent)\n- Phenotype 3: Red and Plain (B absent, C present)\n- Phenotype 4: Plain and Plain (neither present)\n\nThe probabilities for each:\n\n- Phenotype 1: B and C present \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: B present, C absent \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: B absent, C present \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: neither \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but again, none of the options match this. However, if the problem is considering that B is dominant for color and C is dominant for pigment, but the presence of C doesn't affect color and vice versa, then the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nGiven that, and the options provided, the closest matching option is E, which lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This would correspond to a 3:9:1:5 ratio, which doesn't fit our calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is incorrectly phrased, and the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but that's not an option.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Let's clarify:\n\n- C is dominant for pigment \u2192 any C allele leads to red pigment, regardless of B.\n- B is dominant for color \u2192 any B allele leads to brown color, regardless of C.\n\nThus, a bird can have:\n\n1. Both C and B \u2192 red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nEach of these four phenotypes occurs with equal frequency (25% each), leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. None of the options reflect this, so perhaps the intended answer is E, which might be derived from a different reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the presence of dominant alleles in both genes leads to a certain phenotype, overriding others. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in pigment and at least one dominant allele in color, it's considered a certain phenotype, and otherwise, it's a different one.\n\nBut without clear instructions, it's challenging. Given the options, option E seems to suggest a 3:9:1:5 ratio, which doesn't align with our analysis. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the dominance hierarchy and treat the two genes independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's not reflected in the options either.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I think the most plausible answer, despite discrepancies, is option E, as it reflects a balanced distribution across the phenotypes, though strictly speaking, it's not a standard 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps the problem assumes that",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Adding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which is correct. So the fraction for each phenotype is:\n\n- Both traits: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nTherefore, in a large sample size, the counts would approximate these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But let's double-check the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nYes, that matches exactly what we've calculated: Phenotype A (checkered red) is 1/16 of the population, which corresponds to 3 in a group of 16. Wait, no\u2014because the options are giving counts without dividing by the total. So Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which aligns with the numbers we calculated: 9 for both traits, 3 for only C, 3 for only B, and 1 for neither. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect these counts. Looking back at the options provided, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that doesn't add up to 12. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me re-examine the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the probabilities. Let's recalculate the probabilities correctly. For each bird, the probability of having at least one dominant allele for each gene is 3/4. But the presence of both dominant alleles (C and B) is the key for the phenotype. So the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Only C is present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B is present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is present is (1/4)^2=1/16. Adding these up: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which is correct. So the fraction for each phenotype is:\n\n- Both traits: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nTherefore, in a large sample size, the counts would approximate these fractions. So looking at the options, option E states:\n\nCheckered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWhich corresponds to 9, 3, 3, 1, matching our calculations.

Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

So each option presents the number of each phenotype in terms of multiples. Option C is 9, 3, 3, 1, which adds up to 16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is consistent with what I thought earlier.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So in terms of numbers, assuming 16 birds, it would be:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 birds (red and brown)\n- Phenotype B: 3 birds (red and checkered)\n- Phenotype C: 3 birds (plain and brown)\n- Phenotype D: 1 bird (plain and checkered)\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none directly mention 9 and 3 for checkered and brown.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

    "rollout": " So the ratio would be Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3 : 9 : 1 : 3, which corresponds to option E.\n\nWait, but let me verify once again.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the ratio would be Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3 : 9 : 1 : 3, which corresponds to option E.\n\nWait, but let me verify once again.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Let's map this:",
    "rollout": " Let's map this:\n\n- Checkered red (D): 1 part \u2192 1\n- Checkered brown (B): 3 parts \u2192 3\n- Plain red (C): 3 parts \u2192 3\n- Plain brown (A): 9 parts \u2192 9\n\nSo the expected ratio is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. But looking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which also sums to 12. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, which sums to 16, matching our count. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which also sums to 16.\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, the correct ratio is 1:3:3:9, which corresponds to option J (2,6,3,1), but scaled up by a factor of 2. But since the options don't include a scaling factor, perhaps they are presented in reduced terms. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Another approach is to create the Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering the possible gametes. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have gametes CB, cb, cB, cb (each at 25%). Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 will have four types of gametes, each with 25% chance: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Then, when these combine, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, for the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cC: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- bb: Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cB: Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each bird has two traits, and each trait is determined independently. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated based on the F2 genotypes. Let's list the genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- Cc (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- cc (plain), BB (brown) \u2192 C\n- cC (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n- cc (plain), Bb (brown) \u2192 C\n- cB (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n\nWait, no\u2014that's overcomplicating. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by their combination of C and B alleles. The correct approach is to look at the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one C (C_ ) and at least one B (B_) will have Phenotype A (red and brown).\n- Any bird with at least one C (C_ ), but no B (bb) \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered).\n- Any bird with no C (cc), but at least one B (B_) \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown).\n- Any bird with no C (cc) and no B (bb) \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered).\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated based on the F2 genotypes. For each bird, the probability of having both C and B alleles is 3/4 (since the chance of having at least one C is 3/4, and similarly for B). But since the presence of C and B are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. However, this includes all birds that have at least one C and at least one B. The remaining 7/16 correspond to other phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. The correct breakdown is:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C only): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (B only): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. However, when considering the number of birds, the expected counts would be 9k, 3k, 3k, k for each phenotype, where k is the total number of offspring. But looking at the options, none directly reflect 9:3:3:1. However, option J is 2:6:3:1, which is half of the 4:6:4:2, but that doesn't align with our calculations. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is similar but shifted. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. None seem to fit exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order of the options. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption B:8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption G:12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum 18\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nFrom our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9,3,3,1. Looking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse order but still sums to 16. Alternatively, option A is 6,2,6,2. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are ordered differently. Maybe I should consider the order of the letters: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our calculation, checkered red (phenotype A) is 9 parts, checkered brown (phenotype B) is 3 parts, plain red (C) is 3 parts, plain brown (D) is 1 part. So the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options perfectly match this. However, option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the same ratio reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled by dividing by 3, making it 3:1:1:1/3, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the phenotypes. Let me try another approach by constructing the Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, which self-fertilizes. The F2 genotypes will have the following probabilities:\n\n- 25% CC (red), BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% Cc (red), BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% cc (plain), BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- 25% cC (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- 25% cc (plain), Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- 25% cB (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach doesn't account for all combinations properly. Alternatively, each bird's genotype combines both genes, so the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the F2 genotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n- CC (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- Cc (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- cc (plain), BB (brown) \u2192 C\n- cC (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n- cc (plain), Bb (brown) \u2192 C\n- cB (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n\nNow, the number of birds in each phenotype is:\n\n- A: 25% \u2192 1/4 of the population\n- B: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- C: 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 1/2\n- D: 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 1/2\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each bird's genotype has a certain combination, but the phenotypes are based on both genes. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype A: Only C and B \u2192 25%\nPhenotype B: Only C and not B \u2192 25%\nPhenotype C: Only B and not C \u2192 25%\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that's not correct because each bird has two traits, so the presence of both dominant alleles in each gene results in a particular phenotype. So the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype B: C only \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype C: B only \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype D: Neither \u2192 25%\n\nAdding these together gives 100%, but each phenotype has 25%. However, the options provided do not have 25% counts. This suggests that the options are presenting the phenotypes in a different order or scaled differently. Looking back, option E is 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to Phenotypes A (3), B (9), C (1), D (3). Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the number of individuals for each phenotype without considering the scale, but that seems unlikely. \n\nAnother possibility is that I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me consider the F2 generation's possible combinations again. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- 25% Cc (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- 25% cc (plain), BB (brown) \u2192 C\n- 25% cC (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n- 25% cc (plain), Bb (brown) \u2192 C\n- 25% cB (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n\nThis categorization shows that Phenotype A occurs twice (25% + 25%), which is 50%. Phenotype C occurs once (25%) plus once (25%), totaling 50%. Similarly for D. But according to the options, none directly match this. However, option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, suggesting each unit represents 1 bird. But according to our analysis, the correct ratios are 50:50:50:50, but the options don't reflect that. Perhaps the question expects the phenotypes to be considered in a different order, such as checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown. Under this order, checkered red (A) is 9 units, checkered brown (B) is 3, plain red (C) is 3, and plain brown (D) is 1. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Among the options, none exactly match this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which reverses the order of B and C. Alternatively, perhaps I've misassigned the phenotypes. Let me confirm:\n\nIf the phenotypes are ordered as checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, then:\n\n- Checkered red (A) = 9\n- Plain red (C) = 3\n- Checkered brown (B) = 3\n- Plain brown (D) = 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option J: 2,6,3,1. Wait, that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Which adds up to 16. My calculation was 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match. But perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the dominance hierarchy. If 'c' is recessive for both genes, then 'C' is dominant for pigment and 'b' is recessive for pigment. Similarly, 'B' is dominant for color and 'b' is recessive for color. So, a bird with at least one 'C' (pigment red) and at least one 'B' (brown) has both traits. A bird with 'C' and 'b' (brown) would have 'C' but not 'B', resulting in checkered. A bird with 'c' and 'B' (brown) would have 'B' but not 'C', resulting in checkered. A bird with 'c' and 'c' (plain) would have neither, resulting in plain.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios should indeed be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options exactly match this. However, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, so it's too low. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse of 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently, and I should choose based on the closest match. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question is asking for the ratio of checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, which would be 9:3:3:1. But among the options, option J is 2,6,3,1, which is half of what I calculated. Maybe I missed a scaling factor. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended is option E, which is 3,9,1,3, which is the same as 9:3:3:1 but scaled by 1/3. But that's inconsistent because the total should remain 16. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in a different order, such as checking the correct counts based on the F2 generation.\n\nUpon further consideration, perhaps I made an error in the Punnett square approach. Let me try constructing the Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering the possible gametes and their combinations.\n\nEach parent (CC BB and cc bb) can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- From CC BB: CB (pigment red, brown)\n- From CC bb: cb (pigment red, checkered)\n- From cc BB: cb (checkered, brown)\n- From cc bb: bb (checkered, checkered)\n\nWhen these gametes combine, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (red, brown)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (pigment red, brown)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (pigment red, brown)\n- CB + bb \u2192 Cc bb (pigment red, checkered)\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb (pigment red, brown)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (plain, checkered)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (plain, checkered)\n- cb + bb \u2192 cc bb (plain, checkered)\n- bb + CB \u2192 cc Bb (plain, brown)\n- bb + cb \u2192 cc Bb (plain, brown)\n- bb + cb \u2192 cc Bb (plain, brown)\n- bb + bb \u2192 cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nNow, grouping these:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird (red, brown)\n- Cc Bb: 4 birds (red, brown)\n- Cc bb: 2 birds (red, checkered)\n- cc BB: 0 (plain, brown)\n- cc Bb: 4 birds (plain, brown)\n- cc bb: 1 bird (plain, checkered)\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the F2 generation:\n\n- 1 bird from CB + CB\n- 4 birds from CB + cb (and vice versa)\n- 2 birds from cb + bb (and vice versa)\n- 1 bird from bb + bb\n\nBut this approach is messy. Instead, perhaps a better way is to realize that each F2 bird has two traits, and the number of birds with each combination can be calculated based on the independent assortment of the two genes. For each gene, there are 4 possibilities (2^n, n being the number of alleles). So for two genes, there are 4 x 4 = 16 possible combinations. Out of these, each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype. As previously determined, 9 of these combinations result in Phenotype A (red and brown), 3 result in Phenotype B (red and checkered), 3 result in Phenotype C (plain and brown), and 1 results in Phenotype D (plain and checkered). Therefore, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, none of the options directly match this. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the same as 9:3:3:1 but reversed. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which is half of 4:12:6:2, which doesn't align. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which is much higher than our expectation.\n\n",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Let's map this:\n\n- Checkered red (D): 1 part \u2192 1\n- Checkered brown (B): 3 parts \u2192 3\n- Plain red (C): 3 parts \u2192 3\n- Plain brown (A): 9 parts \u2192 9\n\nSo the expected ratio is checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. But looking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which also sums to 12. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6, which sums to 16, matching our count. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which also sums to 16.\n\nWait, but according to our calculation, the correct ratio is 1:3:3:9, which corresponds to option J (2,6,3,1), but scaled up by a factor of 2. But since the options don't include a scaling factor, perhaps they are presented in reduced terms. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Another approach is to create the Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering the possible gametes. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have gametes CB, cb, cB, cb (each at 25%). Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 will have four types of gametes, each with 25% chance: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Then, when these combine, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, for the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cC: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- bb: Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cB: Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each bird has two traits, and each trait is determined independently. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated based on the F2 genotypes. Let's list the genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- Cc (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- cc (plain), BB (brown) \u2192 C\n- cC (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n- cc (plain), Bb (brown) \u2192 C\n- cB (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n\nWait, no\u2014that's overcomplicating. Instead, each bird's phenotype is determined by their combination of C and B alleles. The correct approach is to look at the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Any bird with at least one C (C_ ) and at least one B (B_) will have Phenotype A (red and brown).\n- Any bird with at least one C (C_ ), but no B (bb) \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered).\n- Any bird with no C (cc), but at least one B (B_) \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown).\n- Any bird with no C (cc) and no B (bb) \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered).\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is calculated based on the F2 genotypes. For each bird, the probability of having both C and B alleles is 3/4 (since the chance of having at least one C is 3/4, and similarly for B). But since the presence of C and B are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. However, this includes all birds that have at least one C and at least one B. The remaining 7/16 correspond to other phenotypes. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. The correct breakdown is:\n\n- Phenotype A (both C and B): 9/16\n- Phenotype B (C only): 3/16\n- Phenotype C (B only): 3/16\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. However, when considering the number of birds, the expected counts would be 9k, 3k, 3k, k for each phenotype, where k is the total number of offspring. But looking at the options, none directly reflect 9:3:3:1. However, option J is 2:6:3:1, which is half of the 4:6:4:2, but that doesn't align with our calculations. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is similar but shifted. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. None seem to fit exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order of the options. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption B:8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nOption G:12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum 18\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nFrom our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9,3,3,1. Looking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse order but still sums to 16. Alternatively, option A is 6,2,6,2. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are ordered differently. Maybe I should consider the order of the letters: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our calculation, checkered red (phenotype A) is 9 parts, checkered brown (phenotype B) is 3 parts, plain red (C) is 3 parts, plain brown (D) is 1 part. So the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options perfectly match this. However, option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the same ratio reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled by dividing by 3, making it 3:1:1:1/3, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the phenotypes. Let me try another approach by constructing the Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, which self-fertilizes. The F2 genotypes will have the following probabilities:\n\n- 25% CC (red), BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% Cc (red), BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% cc (plain), BB (brown) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- 25% cC (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D\n- 25% cc (plain), Bb (brown) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- 25% cB (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, no\u2014this approach doesn't account for all combinations properly. Alternatively, each bird's genotype combines both genes, so the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Therefore, the F2 genotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n- CC (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- Cc (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- cc (plain), BB (brown) \u2192 C\n- cC (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n- cc (plain), Bb (brown) \u2192 C\n- cB (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n\nNow, the number of birds in each phenotype is:\n\n- A: 25% \u2192 1/4 of the population\n- B: 25% \u2192 1/4\n- C: 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 1/2\n- D: 25% + 25% = 50% \u2192 1/2\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each bird's genotype has a certain combination, but the phenotypes are based on both genes. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype A: Only C and B \u2192 25%\nPhenotype B: Only C and not B \u2192 25%\nPhenotype C: Only B and not C \u2192 25%\nPhenotype D: Neither C nor B \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that's not correct because each bird has two traits, so the presence of both dominant alleles in each gene results in a particular phenotype. So the correct breakdown is:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype B: C only \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype C: B only \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype D: Neither \u2192 25%\n\nAdding these together gives 100%, but each phenotype has 25%. However, the options provided do not have 25% counts. This suggests that the options are presenting the phenotypes in a different order or scaled differently. Looking back, option E is 3,9,1,3, which corresponds to Phenotypes A (3), B (9), C (1), D (3). Wait, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the options are listing the number of individuals for each phenotype without considering the scale, but that seems unlikely. \n\nAnother possibility is that I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me consider the F2 generation's possible combinations again. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- 25% Cc (red), BB (brown) \u2192 A\n- 25% cc (plain), BB (brown) \u2192 C\n- 25% cC (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n- 25% cc (plain), Bb (brown) \u2192 C\n- 25% cB (plain), bb (checkered) \u2192 D\n\nThis categorization shows that Phenotype A occurs twice (25% + 25%), which is 50%. Phenotype C occurs once (25%) plus once (25%), totaling 50%. Similarly for D. But according to the options, none directly match this. However, option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, suggesting each unit represents 1 bird. But according to our analysis, the correct ratios are 50:50:50:50, but the options don't reflect that. Perhaps the question expects the phenotypes to be considered in a different order, such as checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown. Under this order, checkered red (A) is 9 units, checkered brown (B) is 3, plain red (C) is 3, and plain brown (D) is 1. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Among the options, none exactly match this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which reverses the order of B and C. Alternatively, perhaps I've misassigned the phenotypes. Let me confirm:\n\nIf the phenotypes are ordered as checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, then:\n\n- Checkered red (A) = 9\n- Plain red (C) = 3\n- Checkered brown (B) = 3\n- Plain brown (D) = 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option J: 2,6,3,1. Wait, that doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again: \"the expected phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" Which adds up to 16. My calculation was 9:3:3:1, which doesn't match. But perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the dominance hierarchy. If 'c' is recessive for both genes, then 'C' is dominant for pigment and 'b' is recessive for pigment. Similarly, 'B' is dominant for color and 'b' is recessive for color. So, a bird with at least one 'C' (pigment red) and at least one 'B' (brown) has both traits. A bird with 'C' and 'b' (brown) would have 'C' but not 'B', resulting in checkered. A bird with 'c' and 'B' (brown) would have 'B' but not 'C', resulting in checkered. A bird with 'c' and 'c' (plain) would have neither, resulting in plain.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratios should indeed be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options exactly match this. However, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, so it's too low. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse of 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently, and I should choose based on the closest match. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question is asking for the ratio of checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, which would be 9:3:3:1. But among the options, option J is 2,6,3,1, which is half of what I calculated. Maybe I missed a scaling factor. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended is option E, which is 3,9,1,3, which is the same as 9:3:3:1 but scaled by 1/3. But that's inconsistent because the total should remain 16. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in a different order, such as checking the correct counts based on the F2 generation.\n\nUpon further consideration, perhaps I made an error in the Punnett square approach. Let me try constructing the Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering the possible gametes and their combinations.\n\nEach parent (CC BB and cc bb) can produce four types of gametes:\n\n- From CC BB: CB (pigment red, brown)\n- From CC bb: cb (pigment red, checkered)\n- From cc BB: cb (checkered, brown)\n- From cc bb: bb (checkered, checkered)\n\nWhen these gametes combine, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (red, brown)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (pigment red, brown)\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb (pigment red, brown)\n- CB + bb \u2192 Cc bb (pigment red, checkered)\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb (pigment red, brown)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (plain, checkered)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (plain, checkered)\n- cb + bb \u2192 cc bb (plain, checkered)\n- bb + CB \u2192 cc Bb (plain, brown)\n- bb + cb \u2192 cc Bb (plain, brown)\n- bb + cb \u2192 cc Bb (plain, brown)\n- bb + bb \u2192 cc bb (plain, checkered)\n\nNow, grouping these:\n\n- CC BB: 1 bird (red, brown)\n- Cc Bb: 4 birds (red, brown)\n- Cc bb: 2 birds (red, checkered)\n- cc BB: 0 (plain, brown)\n- cc Bb: 4 birds (plain, brown)\n- cc bb: 1 bird (plain, checkered)\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the F2 generation:\n\n- 1 bird from CB + CB\n- 4 birds from CB + cb (and vice versa)\n- 2 birds from cb + bb (and vice versa)\n- 1 bird from bb + bb\n\nBut this approach is messy. Instead, perhaps a better way is to realize that each F2 bird has two traits, and the number of birds with each combination can be calculated based on the independent assortment of the two genes. For each gene, there are 4 possibilities (2^n, n being the number of alleles). So for two genes, there are 4 x 4 = 16 possible combinations. Out of these, each combination corresponds to a specific phenotype. As previously determined, 9 of these combinations result in Phenotype A (red and brown), 3 result in Phenotype B (red and checkered), 3 result in Phenotype C (plain and brown), and 1 results in Phenotype D (plain and checkered). Therefore, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, none of the options directly match this. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the same as 9:3:3:1 but reversed. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which is half of 4:12:6:2, which doesn't align. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16 but doesn't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:2, which is much higher than our expectation.\n\n",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So Phenotype A: checkered red (1 part) \u2192 1 unit\nPhenotype B: plain red (3 units) \u2192 3\nPhenotype C: red checkered (3 units) \u2192 3\nPhenotype D: plain checkered (1 unit) \u2192 1\n\nSo the ratios are 1:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E. Checking the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Ratios: 3 : 9 : 1 : 3 \u2192 Which simplifies to 1:3:3:1 after dividing by 3.\n\nYes, that matches.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Which aligns with our calculations, where checkered red corresponds to plain (which is phenotype D) and checkered brown is only B, which is phenotype C. Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the definitions. Checkered red is plain and red. Checkered brown is plain and brown. So according to our earlier classification:\n\n- Phenotype A: red and brown\n- Phenotype B: red and checkered\n- Phenotype C: plain and brown\n- Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nSo in terms of the options given:\n\nOption E: checkered red (D: plain and red), checkered brown (C: plain and brown), plain red (B: red and checkered?), wait no:\n\nWait, no\u2014if Phenotype C is plain and brown (checkered is plain), then Phenotype D is plain and checkered (red). So according to the options:\n\n- Option E says: checkered red (D), checkered brown (C), plain red (B), plain brown (A)\n\nWhich fits because:\n\n- checkered red: D (plain and red)\n- checkered brown: C (plain and brown)\n- plain red: B (red and checkered)\n- plain brown: A (red and brown)\n\nAnd the numbers correspond to 3:3:1:1 (since 9+3+3+1=16). Wait, no, the actual counts would be 9:3:3:1, which is equivalent to 3:3:1:1 when divided by 3. But looking at the options, option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+9+1+3=16. But according to our calculations, checkered red (D) should be 1 part, but option E says 3. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nLet me re-examine the probabilities. The probability of having both C and B present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Only C is present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B is present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is present is (1/4)^2=1/16. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios should be 9:3:3:1, meaning checkered red (D) is 1, checkered brown (C) is 3, plain red (B) is 3, plain brown (A) is 9.

That doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is different. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is also different.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the definition of checkered. Let me clarify:\n\nCheckered refers to the absence of the dominant allele for one trait. So, if a bird is checkered, it has the recessive allele for one trait but the dominant for the other. Wait, no\u2014the terminology can vary. Typically, checkered means the opposite of the dominant trait. So if a bird has the recessive allele for one trait, it will display the dominant trait for the other. So, in our case:\n\n- Checkered red: bird is red (dominant) and plain (recessive) \u2192 phenotype D (plain and red)\n- Checkered brown: bird is brown (dominant) and plain (recessive) \u2192 phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Plain red: bird is red (dominant) and checkered (recessive) \u2192 phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- Plain brown: bird is brown (dominant) and checkered (recessive) \u2192 phenotype A (brown and checkered)\n\nNow, based on the probabilities, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, which translates to checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:3, plain brown:1.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which aligns with our calculations, where checkered red corresponds to plain (which is phenotype D) and checkered brown is only B, which is phenotype C. Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the definitions. Checkered red is plain and red. Checkered brown is plain and brown. So according to our earlier classification:\n\n- Phenotype A: red and brown\n- Phenotype B: red and checkered\n- Phenotype C: plain and brown\n- Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nSo in terms of the options given:\n\nOption E: checkered red (D: plain and red), checkered brown (C: plain and brown), plain red (B: red and checkered?), wait no:\n\nWait, no\u2014if Phenotype C is plain and brown (checkered is plain), then Phenotype D is plain and checkered (red). So according to the options:\n\n- Option E says: checkered red (D), checkered brown (C), plain red (B), plain brown (A)\n\nWhich fits because:\n\n- checkered red: D (plain and red)\n- checkered brown: C (plain and brown)\n- plain red: B (red and checkered)\n- plain brown: A (red and brown)\n\nAnd the numbers correspond to 3:3:1:1 (since 9+3+3+1=16). Wait, no, the actual counts would be 9:3:3:1, which is equivalent to 3:3:1:1 when divided by 3. But looking at the options, option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that doesn't add up because 3+9+1+3=16. But according to our calculations, checkered red (D) should be 1 part, but option E says 3. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nLet me re-examine the probabilities. The probability of having both C and B present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Only C is present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B is present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is present is (1/4)^2=1/16. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios should be 9:3:3:1, meaning checkered red (D) is 1, checkered brown (C) is 3, plain red (B) is 3, plain brown (A) is 9. But none of the options seem to reflect this exactly. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nWait, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is different. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is also different.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the definition of checkered. Let me clarify:\n\nCheckered refers to the absence of the dominant allele for one trait. So, if a bird is checkered, it has the recessive allele for one trait but the dominant for the other. Wait, no\u2014the terminology can vary. Typically, checkered means the opposite of the dominant trait. So if a bird has the recessive allele for one trait, it will display the dominant trait for the other. So, in our case:\n\n- Checkered red: bird is red (dominant) and plain (recessive) \u2192 phenotype D (plain and red)\n- Checkered brown: bird is brown (dominant) and plain (recessive) \u2192 phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Plain red: bird is red (dominant) and checkered (recessive) \u2192 phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- Plain brown: bird is brown (dominant) and checkered (recessive) \u2192 phenotype A (brown and checkered)\n\nNow, based on the probabilities, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, which translates to checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, plain red:3, plain brown:1. None of the options match this exactly. Let me look again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nOur calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So option E would be correct if the phenotypes were assigned as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype D (plain and checkered) \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype C (plain and brown) \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain red: Phenotype B (red and plain) \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A (red and brown) \u2192 9 parts\n\nThus, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So in terms of numbers, Phenotype A (red and brown): 3 units, Phenotype B (red and checkered): 9 units, Phenotype C (plain and brown): 3 units, Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1 unit. So the ratio is 3:9:3:1, which simplifies to 1:3:1:1/3. But looking at the options, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't align with our calculations. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That also doesn't align. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Doesn't fit. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation exactly. So the correct answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So in terms of numbers, Phenotype A: 3, Phenotype B:9, Phenotype C:3, Phenotype D:1. But looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nYes, that matches exactly what we've calculated. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:3:1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Let me check.\n\nLooking back: The options are labeled from A to J. Let me re-examine the options. Option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would mean Phenotype A: 3, B:9, C:1, D:3. But according to our calculation, Phenotype A should be 9, B:3, C:3, D:1. So option E is the inverse of what I have. None of the options seem to match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy. The question states: - pigment color (C): dominant = red, recessive = plain\n- body color (B): dominant = brown, recessive = checkered. So, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. Therefore, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment color will be red, regardless of the body color. Similarly, a bird with at least one dominant allele for body color will be brown, regardless of pigment color. So the phenotypic classes are indeed as I thought before: A, B, C, D. Now, the counts should be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none provide this. Maybe I miscalculated something else. Let me try another approach. Let's create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each parent is CcBb, so F1 is CcBb. F2 results from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the Punnett square will have:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (C) and Bb (B)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc (C) and Bb (B)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (c) and Bb (B)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (c) and bb (b)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n1. Cc (from CB) and Bb (from CB) \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Cc (from CB) and Bb (from cb) \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. Cc (from cb) and Bb (from CB) \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. cc (from cb) and bb (from cb) \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the occurrences:\n\nEach gamete is equally likely (25% each), so the F2 generation will have four types:\n\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nBut considering the dominance, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So among the four F2 genotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): CcBb and Ccbb \u2192 These are 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Phenotype B (Plain and Brown): ccBb \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): ccbb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right because each bird has two traits, so the sum should be 100%, but adding 50% +25% +25% gives 100%, which fits. But according to this, Phenotype A (Red and Brown) would occur 50% of the time, Phenotype B (Plain and Brown) 25%, and Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered) 25%. But this contradicts the earlier calculation of 9:3:3:1. What am I missing?\n\nAh! I realize now that the previous approach considered the presence of dominant alleles, while this approach treats each trait separately. The issue arises because in reality, the presence of one dominant allele affects the expression of one trait, and the other trait is expressed based on the other gene. However, the way I'm counting above assumes that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene independently, which may not capture the actual dominance hierarchy properly.\n\nLet me clarify: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. The presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So, a bird with at least one dominant C allele and at least one dominant B allele will have both traits. A bird with at least one dominant C and at least one recessive B will have red and checkered. A bird with at least one recessive C and at least one dominant B will have plain and brown. Finally, a bird with both recessives will have plain and checkered.\n\nGiven that, the probabilities for each phenotype should be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each bird, the probability of having at least one dominant C is 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of CC, 2/4 chance of Cc, and 1/4 chance of cc, but wait, no: the probability of having at least one dominant C is 1 - probability of cc. The probability of cc is 1/4, so the probability of at least one dominant C is 3/4. Similarly, the probability of at least one dominant B is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16. The probability of only C present (and not B) is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16. The probability of only B present (and not C) is (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16. The probability of neither present is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. \n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Both traits: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nIn terms of numbers, if we assume N individuals, the counts would be:\n\n- Both traits: 9N/16 \u2248 0.5625N\n- Only C: 3N/16 \u2248 0.1875N\n- Only B: 3N/16 \u2248 0.1875N\n- Neither: N/16 \u2248 0.0625N\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect this. Let me look back at the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 2\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nNone of these options match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option E presents a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is the inverse of what we have. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic classes. Let me reassess the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant) = red; c (recessive) = plain\n- Body color: B (dominant) = brown; b (recessive) = checkered\n\nTherefore, the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- If C is present (even if B is not), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (even if C is not), the bird is brown.\n- If neither is present, the bird is plain and checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes should be:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. B present, C absent \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, the counts should follow the probabilities where both traits are expressed (phenotype A) is higher than others. Calculating the probabilities:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, none of the answer options match this. The closest is option E, which presents a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is the inverse. But why is that happening? Did I misunderstand the dominance hierarchy?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that both traits are expressed only when both are present, leading to a different ratio. Let me recalculate:\n\nIf the presence of any dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait, then:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nThis still holds. But the answer options do not include this. Let me check option E again: E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply Phenotype A: 3, B:9, C:1, D:3. Which would be 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of what I calculated.\n\nPerhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me consider that when a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it is red, regardless of body color. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body, it is brown, regardless of pigment color. But in reality, the presence of both dominant alleles allows the bird to express both traits. So the initial assumption remains that Phenotype A is 9/16, which translates to 9 parts, and the rest add up accordingly. But none of the answer options match 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, looking again at the options, option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, but that doesn't match our calculations. Option H is 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 16. Option I is 7,5,1,3\u219216. Option J is 2,6,3,1\u219212.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the Punnett square. Let me try again. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- From Cc and Cc for the C locus\n- From Bb and Bb for the B locus\n\nWhen combined, the F2 will have:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- For B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): CC BB \u2192 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 1/16 of N\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): CC Bb \u2192 25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2/16 of N\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): Cc BB \u2192 50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5% \u2192 2/16 of N\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Cc Bb \u2192 50% \u00d7 50% = 25% \u2192 4/16 of N\n- Phenotype E (Checkered and Brown): cc BB \u2192 25% \u2192 1/16 of N\n- Phenotype F (Checkered and Checkered): cc Bb \u2192 25% \u2192 1/16 of N\n\nWait, but this approach doesn't account for the dominance hierarchy correctly. The presence of dominant alleles in each gene should lead to the respective trait. Therefore, the correct way to calculate is:\n\n- For each bird, count the number of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, it has both traits \u2192 Phenotype A\nIf a bird has at least one dominant C and no dominant B \u2192 Phenotype B\nIf a bird has no dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 Phenotype C\nIf a bird has neither dominant C nor dominant B \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype C: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype D: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1 part\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype A: 9, B:3, C:3, D:1. But none of the answer options match this exactly. The closest is option E, which presents a reversed ratio: 3:9:1:3. But this doesn't align with our analysis. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question, and the correct approach is to treat each trait independently without considering their joint occurrence. In that case, Phenotype A would be 25% (all red and brown) \u2192 1/4, Phenotype B: 25% (red and checkered) \u2192 1/4, Phenotype C: 25% (plain and brown) \u2192 1/4, Phenotype D: 25% (plain and checkered) \u2192 1/4. But this also doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, looking back, the options provided are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 2\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nSince none of these options match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, perhaps the original question intended to ask for the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2. Let me check:\n\nThe question asks for the F2 generation, which would require considering the F1 selfing. However, without knowing the correct approach, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the F1 phenotypic ratio, which is 1:1 for each gene. So, for F1:\n\n- C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThus, phenotypes for F1 would be:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A (Red and Brown)\n- CC Bb: Phenotype B (Red and Checkered)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype C (Plain and Brown)\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered)\n- cc BB: Phenotype E (Plain and Brown)\n- cc Bb: Phenotype F (Plain and Checkered)\n\nBut since each bird has two traits, the actual phenotypic classes are:\n\n- A: Phenotype A\n- B: Phenotype B\n- C: Phenotype C\n- D: Phenotype D\n- E: Phenotype E (but E and F are similar; perhaps they are counted together)\n- F: Phenotype F\n\nHowever, the question is about the F2 generation, which requires selfing F1. But since I'm supposed to choose from the given options, and none of them match the F2 ratio, I might have to conclude that the correct answer isn't listed or that I made a mistake elsewhere.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the phenotypic distribution would be 3 checkered red (which would correspond to phenotype D?), but looking back: Wait, no\u2014the options don't align exactly with what I've derived. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes. Let me double-check. The phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nSo the counts should be proportional to 9:3:3:1. But none of the options exactly match this. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This corresponds to 1:3:3:9, which is the inverse of what I calculated. Wait, that can't be right. Option A: 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option B: 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option C: 9:3:3:1 \u2192 Which matches our calculation, but none of the options list this exact. Wait, looking at the options again, none have 9:3:3:1. The closest is option E, which lists 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what I have. Hmm, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check.\n\nLooking back: The options are labeled from A to J. Let me re-examine the options. Option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would mean Phenotype A: 3, B:9, C:1, D:3. But according to our calculation, Phenotype A should be 9, B:3, C:3, D:1. So option E is the inverse of what I have. None of the options seem to match exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy. The question states: - pigment color (C): dominant = red, recessive = plain\n- body color (B): dominant = brown, recessive = checkered. So, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait. Therefore, a bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment color will be red, regardless of the body color. Similarly, a bird with at least one dominant allele for body color will be brown, regardless of pigment color. So the phenotypic classes are indeed as I thought before: A, B, C, D. Now, the counts should be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, none provide this. Maybe I miscalculated something else. Let me try another approach. Let's create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each parent is CcBb, so F1 is CcBb. F2 results from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. So the Punnett square will have:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (C) and Bb (B)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc (C) and Bb (B)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (c) and Bb (B)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (c) and bb (b)\n\nNow, converting these into phenotypes:\n\nFor each bird:\n\n1. Cc (from CB) and Bb (from CB) \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Cc (from CB) and Bb (from cb) \u2192 Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. Cc (from cb) and Bb (from CB) \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. cc (from cb) and bb (from cb) \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the occurrences:\n\nEach gamete is equally likely (25% each), so the F2 generation will have four types:\n\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% Ccbb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 Phenotype B\n- 25% ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nBut considering the dominance, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So among the four F2 genotypes:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): CcBb and Ccbb \u2192 These are 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Phenotype B (Plain and Brown): ccBb \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): ccbb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that can't be right because each bird has two traits, so the sum should be 100%, but adding 50% +25% +25% gives 100%, which fits. But according to this, Phenotype A (Red and Brown) would occur 50% of the time, Phenotype B (Plain and Brown) 25%, and Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered) 25%. But this contradicts the earlier calculation of 9:3:3:1. What am I missing?\n\nAh! I realize now that the previous approach considered the presence of dominant alleles, while this approach treats each trait separately. The issue arises because in reality, the presence of one dominant allele affects the expression of one trait, and the other trait is expressed based on the other gene. However, the way I'm counting above assumes that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene independently, which may not capture the actual dominance hierarchy properly.\n\nLet me clarify: Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of both genes. The presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait. So, a bird with at least one dominant C allele and at least one dominant B allele will have both traits. A bird with at least one dominant C and at least one recessive B will have red and checkered. A bird with at least one recessive C and at least one dominant B will have plain and brown. Finally, a bird with both recessives will have plain and checkered.\n\nGiven that, the probabilities for each phenotype should be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each bird, the probability of having at least one dominant C is 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of CC, 2/4 chance of Cc, and 1/4 chance of cc, but wait, no: the probability of having at least one dominant C is 1 - probability of cc. The probability of cc is 1/4, so the probability of at least one dominant C is 3/4. Similarly, the probability of at least one dominant B is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16. The probability of only C present (and not B) is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16. The probability of only B present (and not C) is (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16. The probability of neither present is (1/4)^2 = 1/16. \n\nThus, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Both traits: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nIn terms of numbers, if we assume N individuals, the counts would be:\n\n- Both traits: 9N/16 \u2248 0.5625N\n- Only C: 3N/16 \u2248 0.1875N\n- Only B: 3N/16 \u2248 0.1875N\n- Neither: N/16 \u2248 0.0625N\n\nBut none of the answer choices reflect this. Let me look back at the options.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 2\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nNone of these options match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option E presents a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is the inverse of what we have. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic classes. Let me reassess the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, the problem statement says:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant) = red; c (recessive) = plain\n- Body color: B (dominant) = brown; b (recessive) = checkered\n\nTherefore, the presence of dominant alleles in each gene leads to the respective trait. So:\n\n- If C is present (even if B is not), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (even if C is not), the bird is brown.\n- If neither is present, the bird is plain and checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes should be:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. B present, C absent \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nNow, the counts should follow the probabilities where both traits are expressed (phenotype A) is higher than others. Calculating the probabilities:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype B: C present, B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype C: B present, C absent \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither present \u2192 (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, none of the answer options match this. The closest is option E, which presents a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is the inverse. But why is that happening? Did I misunderstand the dominance hierarchy?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that both traits are expressed only when both are present, leading to a different ratio. Let me recalculate:\n\nIf the presence of any dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait, then:\n\n- Both traits present: 9/16\n- Only C: 3/16\n- Only B: 3/16\n- Neither: 1/16\n\nThis still holds. But the answer options do not include this. Let me check option E again: E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That would imply Phenotype A: 3, B:9, C:1, D:3. Which would be 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of what I calculated.\n\nPerhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me consider that when a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment, it is red, regardless of body color. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body, it is brown, regardless of pigment color. But in reality, the presence of both dominant alleles allows the bird to express both traits. So the initial assumption remains that Phenotype A is 9/16, which translates to 9 parts, and the rest add up accordingly. But none of the answer options match 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, looking again at the options, option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18, but that doesn't match our calculations. Option H is 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 16. Option I is 7,5,1,3\u219216. Option J is 2,6,3,1\u219212.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the Punnett square. Let me try again. The F1 is CcBb, so the F2 will have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- From Cc and Cc for the C locus\n- From Bb and Bb for the B locus\n\nWhen combined, the F2 will have:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- For B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): CC BB \u2192 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25% \u2192 1/16 of N\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): CC Bb \u2192 25% \u00d7 50% = 12.5% \u2192 2/16 of N\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): Cc BB \u2192 50% \u00d7 25% = 12.5% \u2192 2/16 of N\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): Cc Bb \u2192 50% \u00d7 50% = 25% \u2192 4/16 of N\n- Phenotype E (Checkered and Brown): cc BB \u2192 25% \u2192 1/16 of N\n- Phenotype F (Checkered and Checkered): cc Bb \u2192 25% \u2192 1/16 of N\n\nWait, but this approach doesn't account for the dominance hierarchy correctly. The presence of dominant alleles in each gene should lead to the respective trait. Therefore, the correct way to calculate is:\n\n- For each bird, count the number of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B, it has both traits \u2192 Phenotype A\nIf a bird has at least one dominant C and no dominant B \u2192 Phenotype B\nIf a bird has no dominant C and at least one dominant B \u2192 Phenotype C\nIf a bird has neither dominant C nor dominant B \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype C: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3 parts\n- Phenotype D: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1 part\n\nSo, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Phenotype A: 9, B:3, C:3, D:1. But none of the answer options match this exactly. The closest is option E, which presents a reversed ratio: 3:9:1:3. But this doesn't align with our analysis. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question, and the correct approach is to treat each trait independently without considering their joint occurrence. In that case, Phenotype A would be 25% (all red and brown) \u2192 1/4, Phenotype B: 25% (red and checkered) \u2192 1/4, Phenotype C: 25% (plain and brown) \u2192 1/4, Phenotype D: 25% (plain and checkered) \u2192 1/4. But this also doesn't match the options.\n\nWait, looking back, the options provided are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 2, 6, 3, 9\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 2\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nSince none of these options match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, perhaps the original question intended to ask for the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2. Let me check:\n\nThe question asks for the F2 generation, which would require considering the F1 selfing. However, without knowing the correct approach, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the F1 phenotypic ratio, which is 1:1 for each gene. So, for F1:\n\n- C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\n- B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThus, phenotypes for F1 would be:\n\n- CC BB: Phenotype A (Red and Brown)\n- CC Bb: Phenotype B (Red and Checkered)\n- Cc BB: Phenotype C (Plain and Brown)\n- Cc Bb: Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered)\n- cc BB: Phenotype E (Plain and Brown)\n- cc Bb: Phenotype F (Plain and Checkered)\n\nBut since each bird has two traits, the actual phenotypic classes are:\n\n- A: Phenotype A\n- B: Phenotype B\n- C: Phenotype C\n- D: Phenotype D\n- E: Phenotype E (but E and F are similar; perhaps they are counted together)\n- F: Phenotype F\n\nHowever, the question is about the F2 generation, which requires selfing F1. But since I'm supposed to choose from the given options, and none of them match the F2 ratio, I might have to conclude that the correct answer isn't listed or that I made a mistake elsewhere.

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So according to this, Phenotype A (red and brown): 9 parts, which corresponds to checkered red. Phenotype B (red and plain): 3 parts, which is plain red. Phenotype C (plain and brown): 3 parts, which is checkered brown. Phenotype D (plain and plain): 1 part, which is plain brown. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but ordered as follows: checkered red : plain red : checkered brown : plain brown. But looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This corresponds to Phenotype A (9), B (3), C (3), D (1). So the order in the options is checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown, which matches what I've deduced. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So checking the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nYes, this matches exactly what we've calculated. So the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (phenotype D)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (phenotype B)\n- Plain red: 9 (phenotype A)\n- Plain brown: 3 (phenotype C)\n\nWhich corresponds exactly to option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: 6,2,6,2\nB. Phenotypic ratio:8,4,0,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nSo option C is 9,3,3,1, which aligns with what we've deduced.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But let me verify the numbers:\n\nIf N=16,\n\n- Checkered red (D): 1 bird\n- Checkered brown (B): 3 birds\n- Plain red (C): 3 birds\n- Plain brown (A): 9 birds\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. But looking at the options, option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which is exactly what we have here. So the correct answer would be option E.\n\nNow, regarding the options provided, let me list them again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Let's map this to the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nThis corresponds to Phenotype D: plain and checkered (1 part), Phenotype B: plain and brown (3 parts), Phenotype A: red and brown (9 parts), Phenotype C: red and checkered (3 parts). So the phenotypic ratio is 1 : 3 : 9 : 3, which matches option E. However, looking back, I thought the correct order was checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Option E indeed states that.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

If a bird has both C and B present, it's Phenotype A: red and brown.\nIf it has C present and B absent: Phenotype B: red and checkered.\nIf it has C absent and B present: Phenotype C: plain and brown.\nIf it has neither: Phenotype D: plain and checkered.\n\nSo according to this, Phenotype A is 9/16, B is 3/16, C is 3/16, D is 1/16.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This adds up to 12, which is less than 16. Not matching.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16, matching.

Wait, no, according to our earlier analysis, checkered red (Phenotype D) is 1/16, and checkered brown (Phenotype B) is 3/16. But in the options, checkered brown is listed as 9, and checkered red as 3. That suggests that the phenotypic ratio is inverted. Because according to our calculations, checkered brown (Phenotype B) is more frequent (3 parts vs. 1 part for checkered red). But in the options, checkered brown is 9 and checkered red is 3, which aligns with the 3:9 ratio. That would imply that the phenotypes are ordered as checkered brown before checkered red, but that contradicts our earlier reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the order in the options is different. Wait, perhaps the ordering in the options is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the letters were assigned incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the phenotypic ratio to be expressed in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to others, but without considering dominance.

According to the probabilities, the distribution is:\n\nCheckered red (D): 1 part\nCheckered brown (B): 3 parts\nPlain red (C): 3 parts\nPlain brown (A): 9 parts\n\nThus, the ratio is 1 : 3 : 3 : 9.

Which matches our probabilities if we take checkered red as 1 part (3 units), checkered brown as 3 parts (9 units), plain red as 3 parts (1 unit), and plain brown as 9 parts (3 units). Wait, that would imply that checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, plain red is 1, plain brown is 3. That fits option E. So according to this, the correct answer would be E, but let's verify the rest of the details.\n\nLooking at the phenotypic ratio: Checkered red (D): 1 part, checkered brown (B): 3 parts, plain red (C): 3 parts, plain brown (A): 9 parts. So the ratio would be 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. But the options don't have this exactly. Instead, option E lists 3 (checkered red), 9 (checkered brown), 1 (plain red), and 3 (plain brown). Which aligns perfectly with the 1:3:3:9 ratio when considering that plain red is 3 parts and plain brown is 9 parts. So the phenotypic ratio in terms of counts is 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 3:9:1:3. But looking at the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's exactly what we have. So option E is correct.\n\nWait, but let me ensure that I didn't mix up the numbers. According to our calculation, the number of checkered red birds would correspond to 1 part, which is represented as 3 units in the options (since 16 total, 3/16 is 3 units). Similarly, checkered brown would be 3 parts, represented as 9 units. Plain red is 3 parts, which is 1 unit, and plain brown is 9 parts, which is 3 units.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Let me map it: Checkered red would be when neither C nor B is present, which corresponds to Phenotype D, which is 1 part. But the options don't have 1 part; let me look again. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's 16 parts as well. Hmm, discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me double-check. If a bird has both C and B present, it's Phenotype A: red and brown.\nIf it has C present and B absent: Phenotype B: red and checkered.\nIf it has C absent and B present: Phenotype C: plain and brown.\nIf it has neither: Phenotype D: plain and checkered.\n\nSo according to this, Phenotype A is 9/16, B is 3/16, C is 3/16, D is 1/16.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This adds up to 12, which is less than 16. Not matching.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16, matching. So in terms of numbers, checkered red would correspond to 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But according to our calculations, checkered red should be 1 part, which is 1 unit in 16, while checkered brown should be 3 parts, which is 3 units. Wait, no, according to our earlier analysis, checkered red (Phenotype D) is 1/16, and checkered brown (Phenotype B) is 3/16. But in the options, checkered brown is listed as 9, and checkered red as 3. That suggests that the phenotypic ratio is inverted. Because according to our calculations, checkered brown (Phenotype B) is more frequent (3 parts vs. 1 part for checkered red). But in the options, checkered brown is 9 and checkered red is 3, which aligns with the 3:9 ratio. That would imply that the phenotypes are ordered as checkered brown before checkered red, but that contradicts our earlier reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the order in the options is different. Wait, perhaps the ordering in the options is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the letters were assigned incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the phenotypic ratio to be expressed in terms of the number of each phenotype relative to others, but without considering dominance. Let me try to recast the data. According to the probabilities, the distribution is:\n\nCheckered red (D): 1 part\nCheckered brown (B): 3 parts\nPlain red (C): 3 parts\nPlain brown (A): 9 parts\n\nThus, the ratio is 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. But none of the options directly reflect this. Let me compare with the options:\n\nOption J: 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 1:3:1:1 (but scaled)\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which would mean checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), plain brown (3). Which matches our probabilities if we take checkered red as 1 part (3 units), checkered brown as 3 parts (9 units), plain red as 3 parts (1 unit), and plain brown as 9 parts (3 units). Wait, that would imply that checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, plain red is 1, plain brown is 3. That fits option E. So according to this, the correct answer would be E, but let's verify the rest of the details.\n\nLooking at the phenotypic ratio: Checkered red (D): 1 part, checkered brown (B): 3 parts, plain red (C): 3 parts, plain brown (A): 9 parts. So the ratio would be 1 : 3 : 3 : 9. But the options don't have this exactly. Instead, option E lists 3 (checkered red), 9 (checkered brown), 1 (plain red), and 3 (plain brown). Which aligns perfectly with the 1:3:3:9 ratio when considering that plain red is 3 parts and plain brown is 9 parts. So the phenotypic ratio in terms of counts is 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 3:9:1:3. But looking at the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's exactly what we have. So option E is correct.\n\nWait, but let me ensure that I didn't mix up the numbers. According to our calculation, the number of checkered red birds would correspond to 1 part, which is represented as 3 units in the options (since 16 total, 3/16 is 3 units). Similarly, checkered brown would be 3 parts, represented as 9 units. Plain red is 3 parts, which is 1 unit, and plain brown is 9 parts, which is 3 units. So the correct option is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So checking the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options:\n\nLooking back, the options are labeled A through J, each giving different ratios. Option E states: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to Phenotypes D, C, B, A in our calculation. Because:\n\n- Checkered red (Phenotype D): 1 part\n- Checkered brown (Phenotype C): 3 parts\n- Plain red (Phenotype B): 3 parts\n- Plain brown (Phenotype A): 9 parts\n\nSo the ratio is 1:3:3:9, but ordered as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So matching this order to the options, option E is 3:9:1:3, which would correspond to 1:3:3:9 if reversed. Wait, no\u2014if the parts are 1,3,3,9, then the order would be 1:3:3:9, which would be checkered red (1), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (9). So option E is 3:9:1:3, which doesn't match. Hmm, I think I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the Punnett square. Let me try constructing the F2 Punnett square properly. The F1 is CcBb. When they mate, the possible gametes are CB and cb (each at 50%). So the F2 will have four combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits present): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype C (only B): 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- Phenotype D (none): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAssuming 16 birds in total for simplicity, the counts would be:\n\n- A: 9\n- B: 3\n- C: 3\n- D: 1\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, mapping this to the options:\n\nThe options are presented in different orders, so I need to see which one reflects 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This would correspond to Phenotypes D, C, B, A as 1,3,3,9, which is not the same as 9:3:3:1. \n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This would be 9:3:3:1 if the order was checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. But in reality, the phenotypes are checkered red (D), checkered brown (C), plain red (B), plain brown (A). So the order in the options matters. If option C lists the ratio as 9:3:3:1 in the order checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, that would be correct. But in the options provided, option C is written as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Yes, that matches exactly.

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele).

Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Option E says: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to Phenotype D (plain and checkered): 1 part, Phenotype B (red and checkered): 3 parts, Phenotype C (red and plain): 3 parts, Phenotype A (both traits): 9 parts. So the ratio would be 1:3:3:9, which translates to 1 plain red : 3 plain brown : 3 checkered brown : 9 checkered red.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which corresponds to 3 (phenotype D), 9 (B), 1 (D), 3 (B).",
    "rollout": " So option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which corresponds to 3 (phenotype D), 9 (B), 1 (D), 3 (B). So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:0.25:0.75 when normalized, but in terms of counts, it's 3:9:1:3. However, looking back, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio. So according to our analysis, the expected counts are 3 (D), 9 (B), 1 (D), and 3 (B). So the ratio is 3:9:1:3, but this doesn't match exactly any of the options. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B absent \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain red: C absent, B present \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain brown: both C and B present \u2192 9 parts\n\nSo the counts are 1, 3, 3, 9, respectively. Therefore, the ratio is 1:3:3:9. But none of the options exactly match this. Let me look at the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption K: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, none seem to match. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the phenotypes are based solely on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, without considering the interaction between them. So:\n\n- Both C and B present: red and brown (checkered)\n- C present, B absent: red and checkered\n- C absent, B present: plain and brown\n- Neither: plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities based on independent assortment:\n\n- Both present: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- Only C: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- Only B: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)^2=1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but that's for each gene separately. When combined, it becomes:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nBut that's 13 parts, which doesn't align with any option. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype based on the number of offspring. Assuming a sample size where all phenotypes are equally represented, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each bird is counted based on the number of dominant alleles in each gene, leading to four possible phenotypes with the following ratios:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 1/4 of the time\n- Phenotype B (C only): 1/4 of the time\n- Phenotype C (B only): 1/4 of the time\n- Phenotype D (none): 1/4 of the time\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier analysis. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. The F2 generation comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each gene is segregating independently. For the C locus, the F1 is Cc, so the gametes are C and c, each at 50%. Similarly for the B locus. So the F2 will have the following genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So for each bird, the phenotype is:\n\n- If C is present (i.e., not cc), and B is present (i.e., not bb), then Phenotype A (red and brown).\n- If C is present, but B is not (i.e., bb), Phenotype B (red and checkered).\n- If C is not present (i.e., cc), but B is present (Bb), Phenotype C (plain and brown).\n- If both C and B are not present (cc and bb), Phenotype D (plain and checkered).\n\nTo find the counts, we can calculate the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4 C present) * (3/4 B present) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (3/4 C present) * (1/4 B absent) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (1/4 C absent) * (3/4 B present) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (1/4 C absent) * (1/4 B absent) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. But the options don't include this. Let me look back at the options:\n\nLooking at option K: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Ratios 1:1:1:1. Not matching.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This matches our earlier calculation where checkered red is 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. So the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is option E.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which corresponds to 3 (phenotype D), 9 (B), 1 (D), 3 (B). So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:0.25:0.75 when normalized, but in terms of counts, it's 3:9:1:3. However, looking back, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio. So according to our analysis, the expected counts are 3 (D), 9 (B), 1 (D), and 3 (B). So the ratio is 3:9:1:3, but this doesn't match exactly any of the options. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B absent \u2192 1 part\n- Checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain red: C absent, B present \u2192 3 parts\n- Plain brown: both C and B present \u2192 9 parts\n\nSo the counts are 1, 3, 3, 9, respectively. Therefore, the ratio is 1:3:3:9. But none of the options exactly match this. Let me look at the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nOption K: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, none seem to match. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the phenotypes are based solely on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, without considering the interaction between them. So:\n\n- Both C and B present: red and brown (checkered)\n- C present, B absent: red and checkered\n- C absent, B present: plain and brown\n- Neither: plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities based on independent assortment:\n\n- Both present: (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n- Only C: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n- Only B: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n- Neither: (1/4)^2=1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but that's for each gene separately. When combined, it becomes:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nBut that's 13 parts, which doesn't align with any option. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype based on the number of offspring. Assuming a sample size where all phenotypes are equally represented, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each bird is counted based on the number of dominant alleles in each gene, leading to four possible phenotypes with the following ratios:\n\n- Phenotype A (both traits): 1/4 of the time\n- Phenotype B (C only): 1/4 of the time\n- Phenotype C (B only): 1/4 of the time\n- Phenotype D (none): 1/4 of the time\n\nBut that contradicts the earlier analysis. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. The F2 generation comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each gene is segregating independently. For the C locus, the F1 is Cc, so the gametes are C and c, each at 50%. Similarly for the B locus. So the F2 will have the following genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor C:\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So for each bird, the phenotype is:\n\n- If C is present (i.e., not cc), and B is present (i.e., not bb), then Phenotype A (red and brown).\n- If C is present, but B is not (i.e., bb), Phenotype B (red and checkered).\n- If C is not present (i.e., cc), but B is present (Bb), Phenotype C (plain and brown).\n- If both C and B are not present (cc and bb), Phenotype D (plain and checkered).\n\nTo find the counts, we can calculate the probabilities:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4 C present) * (3/4 B present) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (3/4 C present) * (1/4 B absent) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (1/4 C absent) * (3/4 B present) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (1/4 C absent) * (1/4 B absent) = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. But the options don't include this. Let me look back at the options:\n\nLooking at option K: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 4:4:4:4 \u2192 Ratios 1:1:1:1. Not matching.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This matches our earlier calculation where checkered red is 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. So the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is option E.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So checking the options:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3.\n\nYes, that aligns perfectly with our calculations.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense.

Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "chunk_resampled": "But let's map it correctly.",
    "rollout": " But let's map it correctly. Wait, according to our calculations:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo if we take 16 units, Phenotype A would be 9, B=3, C=3, D=1. But looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype B (only C present), which is 3/16, so 3 units. Checkered brown is Phenotype C, also 3 units. Plain red is Phenotype D (neither), which is 1 unit. Plain brown is Phenotype A (both), which is 9 units. So the order of phenotypes would be: checkered red (3), checkered brown (3), plain red (1), plain brown (9). But the answer choices list them as checkered red first, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. Which aligns with option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's not matching. Our count shows checkered brown as 3 and plain brown as 9. So option E lists checkered brown as 9 and plain brown as 3, which is inverted. Option J lists checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the probabilities. Let me double-check. Another approach is to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each parent (F1) is CcBb. They each produce gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. Wait, actually, each F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, because C is dominant, so CB and cB are the same? No, wait, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for the C gene, each parent contributes either C or c. For the B gene, each parent contributes either B or b. So the gametes for C are C and c, and for B are B and b. Therefore, the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014they\u2019re all distinct because each allele comes from different parents. So the gametes are CB, Cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are determined by combining these gametes. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB x CB: CcBb\n- CB x Cb: CcBb\n- CB x cB: CcBb\n- CB x cb: CcBb\n- cB x CB: CcBb\n- cB x Cb: CcBb\n- cB x cB: ccBb\n- cB x cb: ccBb\n- cb x CB: CcBb\n- cb x Cb: ccBb\n- cb x cB: CcBb\n- cb x cb: ccbb\n\nWait, that's 16 possible combinations. Now, grouping them by phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Cc (from CcBb), Bb (from CcBb). Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 Cc (from CcBb), bb (from CcBb). Phenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 cc (from ccBb), Bb (from ccBb). Phenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 cc (from ccbb), bb (from ccbb).\n\nNow, calculating the probability for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present. For C, the chance is 3/4 (since CcBb has a 3/4 chance of having at least one C allele). For B, similarly, 3/4. Since the alleles are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nPhenotype 2: Only C present (no B). This happens when C is present (3/4) and B is absent (1/4). So probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype 3: Only B present (no C). Similar to above: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B present. Both alleles are recessive. Probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nTherefore, the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16 of the population\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nAssuming a large population, the phenotypic distribution would approximate these fractions. Now, checking the answer options:\n\nLooking back at the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation. According to our analysis, checkered red corresponds to Phenotype 2 (only C present), which is 3/16, so 3 units. Checkered brown is Phenotype 3 (only B present), also 3 units. Plain red is Phenotype 4 (none), which is 1 unit. Plain brown is Phenotype 1 (both present), 9 units. So the order would be checkered red (3), checkered brown (3), plain red (1), plain brown (9). But looking at the options, option J lists checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. None of the options exactly match what we have, but option E lists checkered brown as 9 and plain brown as 3, which is opposite of what we have. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are labeled from A to J, each providing a different ratio. Let me re-examine them:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nFrom our analysis, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options perfectly reflect this. However, option E presents a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is similar but reversed. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nIn our calculation, checkered red is Phenotype 2 (only C present), which is 3/16 \u2192 3 units.\nCheckered brown is Phenotype 3 (only B present), 3 units.\nPlain red is Phenotype 4 (none), 1 unit.\nPlain brown is Phenotype 1 (both present), 9 units.\n\nSo the order should be checkered red (3), checkered brown (3), plain red (1), plain brown (9). But option E lists checkered brown as 9 and plain brown as 3, which is the reverse. That suggests that perhaps the phenotypes were assigned incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the letters. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 which would imply checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which contradicts our calculation. Because checkered brown should be 3, not 9. So perhaps the letters are swapped. Wait, looking at the options, maybe the letters are swapped in terms of red and brown. For example, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, etc., which might fit our ratio if we adjust the numbers. Wait, in our calculation, checkered brown is 3, plain brown is 9, checkered red is 3, plain red is 1. So option J doesn't match. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, etc. Doesn't match. Option F: all 4, which doesn't fit. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, etc. Again, different order. Option A: checkered red 6, which is too high compared to our 3. Option D: checkered red 1, which is too low. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems to have checkered brown as 9 instead of 3. Did I assign the phenotypes wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem defines \"checkered\" as having both traits present, which would mean both C and B present. So:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1: 9\n- Checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2: 3\n- Plain red: C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3: 3\n- Plain brown: neither present \u2192 Phenotype 4: 1\n\nThus, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. However, looking back at the options, option E assigns checkered brown as 9, which conflicts with our calculation. Option J does not match either. Perhaps the options have typos, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic classification was different. Let me try recalculating the probabilities without relying on the Punnett square. The probability of a bird being checkered red (both C and B present) is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16. Checkered brown is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16. Plain red is (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16. Plain brown is (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't provide this. Option C is 12:2:2:0, which is different. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which doesn't fit. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which reverses the checkered brown and plain brown. Option J is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, same as J. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which doesn't match. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which is also incorrect. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of what we have. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is 6:1:1:0 scaled by 2. Option E, however, is 3:9:1:3, which is checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown. Wait, but in reality, checkered brown is 3, checkered red is 9, plain red is 3, plain brown is 1. So the correct order is checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. However, option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which is the reverse. Unless the problem defines checkered differently, perhaps it's defined as at least one dominant allele, regardless of the other. Wait, no\u2014the term 'checkered' typically refers to the presence of both dominant alleles. So perhaps the option is correct if the letters are swapped, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo. Assuming that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not listed, but among the options, option E is the closest, though the order is reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the phenotypes differently. Another possibility is that I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me recalculate.\n\nEach gene's contribution:\n\nFor C: probability of dominant (C) = 3/4\nFor B: probability of dominant (B) = 3/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of both being dominant is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\nOnly C dominant: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nOnly B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nNeither dominant: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. But in the options, none match this exactly. However, option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, plain brown as 3. This suggests that the order is reversed, but checkered brown is 9 and plain brown is 3, which contradicts our calculation. Wait, perhaps I have the letters swapped in the options. Looking back at the options, option J says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Still no match. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of our correct ratio. Unless the user intended to represent the phenotypes differently, perhaps with red and brown flipped. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended to represent the ratio as 3:9:1:3, which would correspond to option E if the letters are swapped. But in the given options, option E is the only one that starts with 3:9:1:3. But the correct order is checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). So unless the letters are swapped, which is unlikely, the correct answer is not listed. However, the closest option is E, which may have a typo or the letters are swapped. Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines \"checkered\" differently, such as having at least one dominant allele, which is always the case except for recessive. Wait, no\u2014the definition remains the same. Maybe the user confused the terms. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem's setup. Let me review the problem statement once more.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb).\n- Checkered is recessive (B is recessive), plain is dominant (B is dominant).\n- Red is recessive (c), brown is dominant (B).\n- Genotypes: F2 generation.\n\nThe Punnett square should be constructed correctly. The F1 from CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous) is Cc Bb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc x Cc \u2192 CcBb\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 CcBb\n- Bb x Cc \u2192 CcBb\n- Bb x Bb \u2192 BB Bb\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 CcBb\n- Bb x Bb \u2192 BB Bb\n\nWait, that's still 16 combinations, leading to the same probabilities. Thus, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't include this. However, option E is the only one that starts with 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the terms. Let me think again: checkered is recessive, so it requires both C and B alleles. Plain is dominant, so it's either C or B. Wait, no\u2014a bird with at least one dominant allele is considered red or brown, depending on the trait. But red is recessive, so only when both C and c are recessive? No, wait, red is recessive (c), so a bird is red only if it has cc. Similarly, brown is dominant (B), so a bird is brown if it has at least one B allele. So the phenotype is determined by whether a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait. Wait, but in our previous analysis, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, leading to the four phenotypes. So, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Among the options, none matches this exactly, but option E is the closest if we assume the letters are swapped. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the number of checkered birds versus others, but I think I've got the right approach. Based on this, I believe the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed, but the closest option is E, which lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. But let's map it correctly. Wait, according to our calculations:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nSo if we take 16 units, Phenotype A would be 9, B=3, C=3, D=1. But looking at the answer choices:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype B (only C present), which is 3/16, so 3 units. Checkered brown is Phenotype C, also 3 units. Plain red is Phenotype D (neither), which is 1 unit. Plain brown is Phenotype A (both), which is 9 units. So the order of phenotypes would be: checkered red (3), checkered brown (3), plain red (1), plain brown (9). But the answer choices list them as checkered red first, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. Which aligns with option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's not matching. Our count shows checkered brown as 3 and plain brown as 9. So option E lists checkered brown as 9 and plain brown as 3, which is inverted. Option J lists checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the probabilities. Let me double-check. Another approach is to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each parent (F1) is CcBb. They each produce gametes: CB, cb, cb, CB. Wait, actually, each F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, because C is dominant, so CB and cB are the same? No, wait, each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So for the C gene, each parent contributes either C or c. For the B gene, each parent contributes either B or b. So the gametes for C are C and c, and for B are B and b. Therefore, the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014they\u2019re all distinct because each allele comes from different parents. So the gametes are CB, Cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are determined by combining these gametes. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB x CB: CcBb\n- CB x Cb: CcBb\n- CB x cB: CcBb\n- CB x cb: CcBb\n- cB x CB: CcBb\n- cB x Cb: CcBb\n- cB x cB: ccBb\n- cB x cb: ccBb\n- cb x CB: CcBb\n- cb x Cb: ccBb\n- cb x cB: CcBb\n- cb x cb: ccbb\n\nWait, that's 16 possible combinations. Now, grouping them by phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 Cc (from CcBb), Bb (from CcBb). Phenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 Cc (from CcBb), bb (from CcBb). Phenotype 3: C absent, B present \u2192 cc (from ccBb), Bb (from ccBb). Phenotype 4: Neither C nor B present \u2192 cc (from ccbb), bb (from ccbb).\n\nNow, calculating the probability for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present. For C, the chance is 3/4 (since CcBb has a 3/4 chance of having at least one C allele). For B, similarly, 3/4. Since the alleles are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nPhenotype 2: Only C present (no B). This happens when C is present (3/4) and B is absent (1/4). So probability is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype 3: Only B present (no C). Similar to above: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nPhenotype 4: Neither C nor B present. Both alleles are recessive. Probability is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nTherefore, the counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 9/16 of the population\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: 1/16\n\nAssuming a large population, the phenotypic distribution would approximate these fractions. Now, checking the answer options:\n\nLooking back at the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that's inconsistent with our calculation. According to our analysis, checkered red corresponds to Phenotype 2 (only C present), which is 3/16, so 3 units. Checkered brown is Phenotype 3 (only B present), also 3 units. Plain red is Phenotype 4 (none), which is 1 unit. Plain brown is Phenotype 1 (both present), 9 units. So the order would be checkered red (3), checkered brown (3), plain red (1), plain brown (9). But looking at the options, option J lists checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. None of the options exactly match what we have, but option E lists checkered brown as 9 and plain brown as 3, which is opposite of what we have. Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nThe options are labeled from A to J, each providing a different ratio. Let me re-examine them:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nJ. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nFrom our analysis, the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but none of the options perfectly reflect this. However, option E presents a ratio of 3:9:1:3, which is similar but reversed. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nIn our calculation, checkered red is Phenotype 2 (only C present), which is 3/16 \u2192 3 units.\nCheckered brown is Phenotype 3 (only B present), 3 units.\nPlain red is Phenotype 4 (none), 1 unit.\nPlain brown is Phenotype 1 (both present), 9 units.\n\nSo the order should be checkered red (3), checkered brown (3), plain red (1), plain brown (9). But option E lists checkered brown as 9 and plain brown as 3, which is the reverse. That suggests that perhaps the phenotypes were assigned incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the letters. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 which would imply checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which contradicts our calculation. Because checkered brown should be 3, not 9. So perhaps the letters are swapped. Wait, looking at the options, maybe the letters are swapped in terms of red and brown. For example, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, etc., which might fit our ratio if we adjust the numbers. Wait, in our calculation, checkered brown is 3, plain brown is 9, checkered red is 3, plain red is 1. So option J doesn't match. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, etc. Doesn't match. Option F: all 4, which doesn't fit. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, etc. Again, different order. Option A: checkered red 6, which is too high compared to our 3. Option D: checkered red 1, which is too low. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems to have checkered brown as 9 instead of 3. Did I assign the phenotypes wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem defines \"checkered\" as having both traits present, which would mean both C and B present. So:\n\n- Checkered red: both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype 1: 9\n- Checkered brown: C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2: 3\n- Plain red: C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3: 3\n- Plain brown: neither present \u2192 Phenotype 4: 1\n\nThus, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. However, looking back at the options, option E assigns checkered brown as 9, which conflicts with our calculation. Option J does not match either. Perhaps the options have typos, or I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic classification was different. Let me try recalculating the probabilities without relying on the Punnett square. The probability of a bird being checkered red (both C and B present) is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16. Checkered brown is (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16. Plain red is (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16. Plain brown is (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't provide this. Option C is 12:2:2:0, which is different. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which doesn't fit. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which reverses the checkered brown and plain brown. Option J is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5:3:2:6, same as J. Option I is 7:5:1:3, which doesn't match. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which is also incorrect. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of what we have. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is 6:1:1:0 scaled by 2. Option E, however, is 3:9:1:3, which is checkered red:checkered brown:plain red:plain brown. Wait, but in reality, checkered brown is 3, checkered red is 9, plain red is 3, plain brown is 1. So the correct order is checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options match this exactly. However, option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, which is the reverse. Unless the problem defines checkered differently, perhaps it's defined as at least one dominant allele, regardless of the other. Wait, no\u2014the term 'checkered' typically refers to the presence of both dominant alleles. So perhaps the option is correct if the letters are swapped, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo. Assuming that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not listed, but among the options, option E is the closest, though the order is reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the phenotypes differently. Another possibility is that I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me recalculate.\n\nEach gene's contribution:\n\nFor C: probability of dominant (C) = 3/4\nFor B: probability of dominant (B) = 3/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of both being dominant is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\nOnly C dominant: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\nOnly B dominant: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\nNeither dominant: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nSo the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. But in the options, none match this exactly. However, option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, plain brown as 3. This suggests that the order is reversed, but checkered brown is 9 and plain brown is 3, which contradicts our calculation. Wait, perhaps I have the letters swapped in the options. Looking back at the options, option J says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Still no match. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse of our correct ratio. Unless the user intended to represent the phenotypes differently, perhaps with red and brown flipped. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended to represent the ratio as 3:9:1:3, which would correspond to option E if the letters are swapped. But in the given options, option E is the only one that starts with 3:9:1:3. But the correct order is checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). So unless the letters are swapped, which is unlikely, the correct answer is not listed. However, the closest option is E, which may have a typo or the letters are swapped. Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines \"checkered\" differently, such as having at least one dominant allele, which is always the case except for recessive. Wait, no\u2014the definition remains the same. Maybe the user confused the terms. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem's setup. Let me review the problem statement once more.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb).\n- Checkered is recessive (B is recessive), plain is dominant (B is dominant).\n- Red is recessive (c), brown is dominant (B).\n- Genotypes: F2 generation.\n\nThe Punnett square should be constructed correctly. The F1 from CC BB (homozygous) and cc bb (homozygous) is Cc Bb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc x Cc \u2192 CcBb\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 CcBb\n- Bb x Cc \u2192 CcBb\n- Bb x Bb \u2192 BB Bb\n- Cc x Bb \u2192 CcBb\n- Bb x Bb \u2192 BB Bb\n\nWait, that's still 16 combinations, leading to the same probabilities. Thus, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. But the options don't include this. However, option E is the only one that starts with 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the terms. Let me think again: checkered is recessive, so it requires both C and B alleles. Plain is dominant, so it's either C or B. Wait, no\u2014a bird with at least one dominant allele is considered red or brown, depending on the trait. But red is recessive, so only when both C and c are recessive? No, wait, red is recessive (c), so a bird is red only if it has cc. Similarly, brown is dominant (B), so a bird is brown if it has at least one B allele. So the phenotype is determined by whether a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait. Wait, but in our previous analysis, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, leading to the four phenotypes. So, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Among the options, none matches this exactly, but option E is the closest if we assume the letters are swapped. Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to ask for the number of checkered birds versus others, but I think I've got the right approach. Based on this, I believe the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed, but the closest option is E, which lists checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown ",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect.

Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities.

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",
    "chunk_resampled": "So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3 for checkered red (D), checkered brown (B), plain red (C), plain brown (A)?",
    "rollout": " So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3 for checkered red (D), checkered brown (B), plain red (C), plain brown (A)? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in our classification above, A was red and brown, which is checkered red. B was red and checkered, which is plain red. C was plain and brown, which is checkered brown. D was plain and checkered, which is plain red. Wait, that can't be right because A is red and brown (checkered red?), B is red and checkered (plain red?), C is plain and brown (checkered brown?), D is plain and checkered (plain red?). Wait, that would mean that checkered red and plain red are the same phenotype, which contradicts the initial description. Hmm, that indicates a misunderstanding in the classification. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem states that the checkered pattern is due to the genotype cc, and the plain is due to the genotype bb. So, the checkered color is represented by the genotype cc, while the plain color is represented by bb. But the checkered bird is also a different trait\u2014does it refer to the pigment color being checkered (which is recessive) or the physical checkering (which is dominant)? This is crucial because the phenotype definitions depend on whether the checkered color is dominant or recessive. From the problem: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, brown is recessive, and red is dominant. Checkered is probably referring to the lack of pigment, hence the recessive phenotype for color, which would correspond to the genotype cc. So, the presence of the dominant B allele results in red or brown, while the presence of the recessive b allele results in checkered. Now, the checkered pattern refers to the physical characteristic, not the color. So, the phenotype for checkered is the physical characteristic, and the color is determined by the B and b alleles. Wait, but the problem says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C\". Wait, that's confusing. Because the problem mentions two genes, C and B, but the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. So, does that mean that the checkered pattern is determined by gene C, and the color by gene B? Or is it that the checkered pattern is a separate trait?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the checkered pattern is a separate trait, determined by gene C, and the color is determined by gene B. So, the checkered pattern is a physical characteristic, while the color is determined by the B and b alleles. That changes things. So, the checkered pattern is determined by gene C, and the color is determined by B and b. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered pattern: recessive (cc)\n- Color: dominant (B) = red, recessive (b) = brown\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have various combinations of these traits. The F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of the checkered pattern (gene C) and the color (genes B and b). So, for each bird in F2, their phenotype is determined by:\n\n- Checkered: cc\n- Color: determined by B and b (as before)\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc and B present\n2. Checkered brown: cc and b present\n3. Plain red: cc and b absent (i.e., cc and bb)\n4. Plain brown: cc and B absent (i.e., cc and Bb)\n\nSo, now, the probabilities are calculated based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc and B present): \n   - Probability of cc: 1/4 (since cc is recessive)\n   - Probability of B present: 3/4 (since B is dominant)\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n2. Checkered brown (cc and b present):\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of b present: 1/4\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\n3. Plain red (cc and b absent): \n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of b absent: 3/4\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (cc and B absent): \n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of B absent: 1/4\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these probabilities to ratios: \n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3/16 : 1/16 : 3/16 : 1/16 = 3:1:3:1\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation. However, the problem includes both checkered and plain patterns, so the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc and B present)\n2. Checkered brown (cc and b present)\n3. Plain red (cc and b absent)\n4. Plain brown (cc and B absent)\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:1:3:1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown respectively. But looking at the answer options, none seem to exactly match this. Let's look back at the options:\n\nA. 6:6 (checkered red and plain red vs checkered brown and plain brown)\nB. 8:4 (more checkered than plain)\nC. 9:3:3:1 (different distribution)\nD. 1:3:9:3 (unlikely)\nE. 3:9:1:3 (again similar to what I had)\nF. 4:4 (even split)\nG. 12:2 (twice as much)\nH. 5:3 (different numbers)\nI. 7:5 (different)\n\nWait, according to my calculations, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:1:3:1 for the four phenotypes. None of the options perfectly match this, but let's examine the options again. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which seems to align with the 1/4 and 3/4 probabilities for the checkered aspect, but without considering the color aspects properly. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the color probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the probabilities. Let me recalculate the probabilities for each phenotype correctly.\n\nEach bird has two independent genes, C and B. The presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype.\n\nFor the checkered pattern (gene C):\n\n- Checkered: cc (recessive)\n- Plain: CC (dominant)\n\nFor the color (genes B and b):\n\n- Brown: B (dominant)\n- Checkered: b (recessive)\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- For gene C (C/C, C/c, cc)\n- For gene B (B/B, Bb, bb)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products of individual probabilities.\n\nLet's list all possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc (for gene C) AND B present (either B or Bb)\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of B present: 3/4 (since B is dominant)\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n2. Checkered brown: cc AND b present\n   - 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\n3. Plain red: cc AND b absent (bb)\n   - 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown: cc AND B absent (Bb)\n   - 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nTotal: 3/16 + 1/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 8/16 = 1/2\n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum should be 1. Did I miss something? Oh, no\u2014I forgot that the presence of both genes is considered. Wait, no, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Let me try a different approach using a Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation will have the following possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nGene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nTo find the phenotypes, we need to consider the combination of these:\n\n- For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) or not (plain) and whether B is present (brown) or not (checkered).\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypic ratio, we can consider all possible combinations and count the number of each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the frequency of each phenotype by considering the probabilities of each trait:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc and B present):\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of B present: 3/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n2. Checkered brown (cc and b present):\n   - 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\n3. Plain red (cc and b absent):\n   - 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (cc and B absent):\n   - 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 3+1+3+1 = 8 parts, which should be 8/16 = 1/2. Wait, that's only half the population. Where is the missing 8/16? Oh, wait, perhaps I missed the fact that the phenotypes include the checkered pattern (cc) plus the color. So, the total population is divided equally between checkered and plain patterns. Wait, but the problem mentions that checkered is a separate trait, so perhaps the total population is 8/16 for checkered and 8/16 for plain, but that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014if each bird has a 50% chance of being checkered (cc) and 50% of being plain (CC), then the total population is equally split between checkered and plain. But within each group, the color is determined by the B alleles.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/16 (from cc and B present)\n- Checkered brown: 1/16 (from cc and b present)\n- Plain red: 3/16 (from cc and b absent)\n- Plain brown: 1/16 (from cc and B absent)\n\nWait, adding those up: 3+1+3+1 = 8 parts, which is 8/16. But the remaining 8/16 are not accounted for. Wait, perhaps I missed that the presence of C is always red, and the presence of B is always brown, regardless of the presence of c. So, the presence of cc (checkered) along with B present (brown) would be checkered brown, and cc with b present (checkered) would be checkered red. Similarly, cc with B absent (checkered) would be plain brown, and cc with b absent (plain) would be plain red. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered brown (cc and B present)\n2. Checkered red (cc and b present)\n3. Plain brown (cc and b absent)\n4. Plain red (cc and B absent)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Checkered brown: 1/4 (cc) * 3/4 (B present) = 3/16\n2. Checkered red: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n3. Plain brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n4. Plain red: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nAdding them up: 3+1+1+3 = 8 parts, which is 8/16. Wait, but that leaves 8/16 unaccounted for. Oh, no\u2014I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it:\n\nWait, no, the probabilities should add up to 1. Let's see:\n\n(1/4 * 3/4) + (1/4 * 1/4) + (1/4 * 1/4) + (1/4 * 3/4) = 3/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 3/16 = 8/16 = 1/2. That still doesn't add up to 1. Wait, no\u2014because each bird has two genes, but the presence of C is always red, and the presence of B is always brown. So, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered brown (cc and B present)\n2. Checkered red (cc and b present)\n3. Plain brown (cc and b absent)\n4. Plain red (cc and B absent)\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Checkered brown: 1/4 (cc) * 3/4 (B present) = 3/16\n2. Checkered red: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n3. Plain brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n4. Plain red: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nSumming these: 3+1+1+3 = 8 parts, which is 8/16 = 1/2. But wait, that leaves 8/16 unaccounted for. That can't be right because all birds must fall into one of these four categories. Perhaps I miscounted the number of parts. Let's think differently. Instead of parts, let's calculate the exact counts. Suppose there are 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 3 birds\n\nThis totals 8 birds, which is half the population. That's odd. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the checkered pattern as a separate trait. If the checkered pattern is determined by gene C, then in the F2 generation, half the birds are checkered (cc) and half are plain (CC). Within the checkered birds, the color is determined by the B alleles, and within the plain birds, it's determined by the B alleles as well.\n\nSo, for the checkered birds (cc):\n\n- B present (brown): 3/4 of the time\n- b present (checkered): 1/4 of the time\n\nFor the plain birds (CC):\n\n- B present (brown): 3/4 of the time\n- b present (checkered): 1/4 of the time\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio within checkered birds is 3:1 (brown to checkered), and within plain birds, it's also 3:1. But since half the birds are checkered and half are plain, the overall ratio would be:\n\nTotal brown: (3/2) + (3/2) = 3\nTotal checkered: (1/2) + (1/2) = 1\nWait, that can't be right because the total should be 16 birds. Let me clarify:\n\nIf half the birds are checkered (cc) and half are plain (CC), then:\n\n- Checkered birds (cc): 8 birds\n   - Brown: 6 birds (3/4 of 8)\n   - Checkered: 2 birds (1/4 of 8)\n- Plain birds (CC): 8 birds\n   - Brown: 6 birds (3/4 of 8)\n   - Checkered: 2 birds (1/4 of 8)\n\nTotal brown: 6 + 6 = 12\nTotal checkered: 2 + 2 = 4\nBut wait, that's 16 birds, so the ratio would be 12:4, which simplifies to 3:1. But that doesn't account for the checkered pattern itself. Wait, perhaps I'm conflating the two traits. Let me approach it differently. The checkered pattern is determined by gene C, and the color is determined by gene B. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc and B present\n2. Checkered brown: cc and b present\n3. Plain red: cc and b absent\n4. Plain brown: cc and B absent\n\nEach of these happens with certain probabilities, and collectively, they sum to 100%.\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Checkered red: 1/4 (cc) * 3/4 (B present) = 3/16\n2. Checkered brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n3. Plain red: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n4. Plain brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nTotal: 3+1+3+1 = 8 parts, which is 8/16 = 1/2. That suggests that half the birds are checkered and half are plain, but within each group, the color is determined by B. So, the checkered birds have a 3:1 ratio of brown to checkered, and the plain birds also have a 3:1 ratio. So, the overall ratio would be:\n\nTotal brown: (3/2) + (3/2) = 3\nTotal checkered: (1/2) + (1/2) = 1\nBut that's not correct because the sum should be 16 birds. Let me instead consider each bird's phenotype:\n\nWithin checkered birds (cc):\n\n- Brown: 3/4\n- Checkered: 1/4\n\nWithin plain birds (CC):\n\n- Brown: 3/4\n- Checkered: 1/4\n\nSo, for 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered birds: 8 birds\n   - Brown: 6\n  ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3 for checkered red (D), checkered brown (B), plain red (C), plain brown (A)? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in our classification above, A was red and brown, which is checkered red. B was red and checkered, which is plain red. C was plain and brown, which is checkered brown. D was plain and checkered, which is plain red. Wait, that can't be right because A is red and brown (checkered red?), B is red and checkered (plain red?), C is plain and brown (checkered brown?), D is plain and checkered (plain red?). Wait, that would mean that checkered red and plain red are the same phenotype, which contradicts the initial description. Hmm, that indicates a misunderstanding in the classification. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem states that the checkered pattern is due to the genotype cc, and the plain is due to the genotype bb. So, the checkered color is represented by the genotype cc, while the plain color is represented by bb. But the checkered bird is also a different trait\u2014does it refer to the pigment color being checkered (which is recessive) or the physical checkering (which is dominant)? This is crucial because the phenotype definitions depend on whether the checkered color is dominant or recessive. From the problem: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So, brown is recessive, and red is dominant. Checkered is probably referring to the lack of pigment, hence the recessive phenotype for color, which would correspond to the genotype cc. So, the presence of the dominant B allele results in red or brown, while the presence of the recessive b allele results in checkered. Now, the checkered pattern refers to the physical characteristic, not the color. So, the phenotype for checkered is the physical characteristic, and the color is determined by the B and b alleles. Wait, but the problem says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C\". Wait, that's confusing. Because the problem mentions two genes, C and B, but the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. So, does that mean that the checkered pattern is determined by gene C, and the color by gene B? Or is it that the checkered pattern is a separate trait?\n\nLooking back at the problem: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the checkered pattern is a separate trait, determined by gene C, and the color is determined by gene B. So, the checkered pattern is a physical characteristic, while the color is determined by the B and b alleles. That changes things. So, the checkered pattern is determined by gene C, and the color is determined by B and b. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered pattern: recessive (cc)\n- Color: dominant (B) = red, recessive (b) = brown\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have various combinations of these traits. The F2 phenotypes depend on the combination of the checkered pattern (gene C) and the color (genes B and b). So, for each bird in F2, their phenotype is determined by:\n\n- Checkered: cc\n- Color: determined by B and b (as before)\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc and B present\n2. Checkered brown: cc and b present\n3. Plain red: cc and b absent (i.e., cc and bb)\n4. Plain brown: cc and B absent (i.e., cc and Bb)\n\nSo, now, the probabilities are calculated based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc and B present): \n   - Probability of cc: 1/4 (since cc is recessive)\n   - Probability of B present: 3/4 (since B is dominant)\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n2. Checkered brown (cc and b present):\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of b present: 1/4\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\n3. Plain red (cc and b absent): \n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of b absent: 3/4\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (cc and B absent): \n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of B absent: 1/4\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these probabilities to ratios: \n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown = 3/16 : 1/16 : 3/16 : 1/16 = 3:1:3:1\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation. However, the problem includes both checkered and plain patterns, so the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc and B present)\n2. Checkered brown (cc and b present)\n3. Plain red (cc and b absent)\n4. Plain brown (cc and B absent)\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:1:3:1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown respectively. But looking at the answer options, none seem to exactly match this. Let's look back at the options:\n\nA. 6:6 (checkered red and plain red vs checkered brown and plain brown)\nB. 8:4 (more checkered than plain)\nC. 9:3:3:1 (different distribution)\nD. 1:3:9:3 (unlikely)\nE. 3:9:1:3 (again similar to what I had)\nF. 4:4 (even split)\nG. 12:2 (twice as much)\nH. 5:3 (different numbers)\nI. 7:5 (different)\n\nWait, according to my calculations, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:1:3:1 for the four phenotypes. None of the options perfectly match this, but let's examine the options again. Option E is 3:9:1:3, which seems to align with the 1/4 and 3/4 probabilities for the checkered aspect, but without considering the color aspects properly. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the color probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused the probabilities. Let me recalculate the probabilities for each phenotype correctly.\n\nEach bird has two independent genes, C and B. The presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype.\n\nFor the checkered pattern (gene C):\n\n- Checkered: cc (recessive)\n- Plain: CC (dominant)\n\nFor the color (genes B and b):\n\n- Brown: B (dominant)\n- Checkered: b (recessive)\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- For gene C (C/C, C/c, cc)\n- For gene B (B/B, Bb, bb)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products of individual probabilities.\n\nLet's list all possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc (for gene C) AND B present (either B or Bb)\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of B present: 3/4 (since B is dominant)\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n2. Checkered brown: cc AND b present\n   - 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\n3. Plain red: cc AND b absent (bb)\n   - 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown: cc AND B absent (Bb)\n   - 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nTotal: 3/16 + 1/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 8/16 = 1/2\n\nWait, that can't be right because the sum should be 1. Did I miss something? Oh, no\u2014I forgot that the presence of both genes is considered. Wait, no, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. Let me try a different approach using a Punnett square for the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation will have the following possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nGene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nGene B: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nTo find the phenotypes, we need to consider the combination of these:\n\n- For each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) or not (plain) and whether B is present (brown) or not (checkered).\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypic ratio, we can consider all possible combinations and count the number of each phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the frequency of each phenotype by considering the probabilities of each trait:\n\n1. Checkered red (cc and B present):\n   - Probability of cc: 1/4\n   - Probability of B present: 3/4\n   - Combined: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n2. Checkered brown (cc and b present):\n   - 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\n3. Plain red (cc and b absent):\n   - 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (cc and B absent):\n   - 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 3+1+3+1 = 8 parts, which should be 8/16 = 1/2. Wait, that's only half the population. Where is the missing 8/16? Oh, wait, perhaps I missed the fact that the phenotypes include the checkered pattern (cc) plus the color. So, the total population is divided equally between checkered and plain patterns. Wait, but the problem mentions that checkered is a separate trait, so perhaps the total population is 8/16 for checkered and 8/16 for plain, but that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014if each bird has a 50% chance of being checkered (cc) and 50% of being plain (CC), then the total population is equally split between checkered and plain. But within each group, the color is determined by the B alleles.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/16 (from cc and B present)\n- Checkered brown: 1/16 (from cc and b present)\n- Plain red: 3/16 (from cc and b absent)\n- Plain brown: 1/16 (from cc and B absent)\n\nWait, adding those up: 3+1+3+1 = 8 parts, which is 8/16. But the remaining 8/16 are not accounted for. Wait, perhaps I missed that the presence of C is always red, and the presence of B is always brown, regardless of the presence of c. So, the presence of cc (checkered) along with B present (brown) would be checkered brown, and cc with b present (checkered) would be checkered red. Similarly, cc with B absent (checkered) would be plain brown, and cc with b absent (plain) would be plain red. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered brown (cc and B present)\n2. Checkered red (cc and b present)\n3. Plain brown (cc and b absent)\n4. Plain red (cc and B absent)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities for each:\n\n1. Checkered brown: 1/4 (cc) * 3/4 (B present) = 3/16\n2. Checkered red: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n3. Plain brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n4. Plain red: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nAdding them up: 3+1+1+3 = 8 parts, which is 8/16. Wait, but that leaves 8/16 unaccounted for. Oh, no\u2014I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo it:\n\nWait, no, the probabilities should add up to 1. Let's see:\n\n(1/4 * 3/4) + (1/4 * 1/4) + (1/4 * 1/4) + (1/4 * 3/4) = 3/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 3/16 = 8/16 = 1/2. That still doesn't add up to 1. Wait, no\u2014because each bird has two genes, but the presence of C is always red, and the presence of B is always brown. So, the phenotypes are determined by both genes. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered brown (cc and B present)\n2. Checkered red (cc and b present)\n3. Plain brown (cc and b absent)\n4. Plain red (cc and B absent)\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Checkered brown: 1/4 (cc) * 3/4 (B present) = 3/16\n2. Checkered red: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n3. Plain brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n4. Plain red: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nSumming these: 3+1+1+3 = 8 parts, which is 8/16 = 1/2. But wait, that leaves 8/16 unaccounted for. That can't be right because all birds must fall into one of these four categories. Perhaps I miscounted the number of parts. Let's think differently. Instead of parts, let's calculate the exact counts. Suppose there are 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Plain brown: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 3 birds\n\nThis totals 8 birds, which is half the population. That's odd. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the checkered pattern as a separate trait. If the checkered pattern is determined by gene C, then in the F2 generation, half the birds are checkered (cc) and half are plain (CC). Within the checkered birds, the color is determined by the B alleles, and within the plain birds, it's determined by the B alleles as well.\n\nSo, for the checkered birds (cc):\n\n- B present (brown): 3/4 of the time\n- b present (checkered): 1/4 of the time\n\nFor the plain birds (CC):\n\n- B present (brown): 3/4 of the time\n- b present (checkered): 1/4 of the time\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio within checkered birds is 3:1 (brown to checkered), and within plain birds, it's also 3:1. But since half the birds are checkered and half are plain, the overall ratio would be:\n\nTotal brown: (3/2) + (3/2) = 3\nTotal checkered: (1/2) + (1/2) = 1\nWait, that can't be right because the total should be 16 birds. Let me clarify:\n\nIf half the birds are checkered (cc) and half are plain (CC), then:\n\n- Checkered birds (cc): 8 birds\n   - Brown: 6 birds (3/4 of 8)\n   - Checkered: 2 birds (1/4 of 8)\n- Plain birds (CC): 8 birds\n   - Brown: 6 birds (3/4 of 8)\n   - Checkered: 2 birds (1/4 of 8)\n\nTotal brown: 6 + 6 = 12\nTotal checkered: 2 + 2 = 4\nBut wait, that's 16 birds, so the ratio would be 12:4, which simplifies to 3:1. But that doesn't account for the checkered pattern itself. Wait, perhaps I'm conflating the two traits. Let me approach it differently. The checkered pattern is determined by gene C, and the color is determined by gene B. So, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc and B present\n2. Checkered brown: cc and b present\n3. Plain red: cc and b absent\n4. Plain brown: cc and B absent\n\nEach of these happens with certain probabilities, and collectively, they sum to 100%.\n\nCalculating each:\n\n1. Checkered red: 1/4 (cc) * 3/4 (B present) = 3/16\n2. Checkered brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n3. Plain red: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n4. Plain brown: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nTotal: 3+1+3+1 = 8 parts, which is 8/16 = 1/2. That suggests that half the birds are checkered and half are plain, but within each group, the color is determined by B. So, the checkered birds have a 3:1 ratio of brown to checkered, and the plain birds also have a 3:1 ratio. So, the overall ratio would be:\n\nTotal brown: (3/2) + (3/2) = 3\nTotal checkered: (1/2) + (1/2) = 1\nBut that's not correct because the sum should be 16 birds. Let me instead consider each bird's phenotype:\n\nWithin checkered birds (cc):\n\n- Brown: 3/4\n- Checkered: 1/4\n\nWithin plain birds (CC):\n\n- Brown: 3/4\n- Checkered: 1/4\n\nSo, for 16 birds:\n\n- Checkered birds: 8 birds\n   - Brown: 6\n  ",

    "chunk_removed": "Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense.

Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele).

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Option E states: 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. Which corresponds to Phenotype C (plain red), Phenotype B (red checkered), Phenotype A (red brown), and Phenotype D (plain checkered). So the order is checkered red (C), checkered brown (B), red brown (A), plain checkered (D). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:9:3, but the options list them in terms of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So option E lists them as 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown, which matches our calculation.\n\nNow, looking at the answer choices: Options G through I seem to have different ratios.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, grouped as 9:3 (checkered red and brown), 3:1 (plain red and plain brown). But looking at the options, option E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" That's exactly matching our calculation of 9:3:3:1, but grouped differently. So the ratio is 9 (checkered red) : 3 (checkered brown) : 3 (plain red) : 1 (plain brown). But the options don't list it as such; instead, option E lists checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 9, plain red as 1, plain brown as 3, which corresponds to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.
