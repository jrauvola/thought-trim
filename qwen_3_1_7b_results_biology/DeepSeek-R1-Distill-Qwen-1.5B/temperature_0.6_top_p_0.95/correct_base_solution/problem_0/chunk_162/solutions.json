    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

    "rollout": "\nB.8,4,0,4\u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192 sum 16\nSo all options have 16 as the total. Now, looking at the counts:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation: Phenotype A (both traits) 9, B (only C) 3, C (only B) 3, D (neither) 1.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This also matches, as it reflects the same distribution but swapped between red and brown. So both Options C and E seem plausible. However, looking back at the problem statement, the F2 generation refers to the offspring after two generations, and the initial cross is between a homozygous red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the next generation, which would indeed follow the Mendelian ratios. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is represented by Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

So both Options C and E seem plausible. However, looking back at the problem statement, the F2 generation refers to the offspring after two generations, and the initial cross is between a homozygous red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 is CcBb, and F2 is the next generation, which would indeed follow the Mendelian ratios. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect the 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is represented by Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16; B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16; C.9,3,3,1\u2192sum16; D.1,3,9,3\u2192sum16; E.3,9,1,3\u2192sum16. All add up to 16, which is correct according to our calculations. Now, looking at the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red (Class D): 1 part\n- Checkered brown (Class B): 3 parts\n- Plain red (Class C): 3 parts\n- Plain brown (Class A): 9 parts\n\nSo the ratios would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes ratios are presented without denominators, but here the options include relative counts, so option C seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options sum to 16.

Wait, but according to our previous classification, Phenotype A was \"red and brown,\" which would correspond to option C: checkered red (probably confused here), no, wait, let's clarify:\n\nWait, no\u2014I may have mixed up the definitions.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

But looking at the options, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches our calculation. Wait, but let me double-check the reasoning. Because in reality, the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of a bird having both traits is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16, so 9 parts, while having only C is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, so 3 parts, same for only B. And neither is 1/16. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which aligns with option C. However, looking back, I realize that the options may have been presented differently.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16. D. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. E. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. F. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16. G. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16. H. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16. I.7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. J. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12. K.4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16. L.1,1,1,1 \u2192 sum 4. M.2,2,2,2 \u2192 sum 8.

Q. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16.\n\nWait, according to our calculations, the correct distribution is Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1 \u2192 which corresponds to option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But looking at the options, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches our calculation. Wait, but let me double-check the reasoning. Because in reality, the presence of C and B are independent, the probability of a bird having both traits is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16, so 9 parts, while having only C is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, so 3 parts, same for only B. And neither is 1/16. So the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which aligns with option C. However, looking back, I realize that the options may have been presented differently. Option C states: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which fits our calculation perfectly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options add up to 16, which aligns with our calculations. Now, looking at the question, the task is to identify the correct phenotypic ratio from the options. From our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, the options presented are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 16\nC.

Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16\n\nSince our analysis shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, the correct answer should reflect this distribution among the phenotypes. Among the options, only option C presents this exact ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

But looking at the answer choices, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which also sums to 16. Hmm, but why does the sum come out to 16? Because in reality, the sum of probabilities is 1, so scaling by N gives counts. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but that's not among the options. Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in interpreting the probabilities. Let me re-examine. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present (B absent): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present (C absent): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.

However, looking at the answer choices, option E has the same sum but different distribution. Wait, no\u2014they\u2019re all different. Option C's ratio is exactly what we derived. But looking back at the user's options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which aligns with our 9:3:3:1 ratio.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16? No, 6+2=8, 6+2=8. Total 16? Wait, 6+2+6+2=16. Oh! Yes, so the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:6:2, which corresponds to the 16 parts. But looking at the answer choices, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which also sums to 16. Hmm, but why does the sum come out to 16? Because in reality, the sum of probabilities is 1, so scaling by N gives counts. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but that's not among the options. Wait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake in interpreting the probabilities. Let me re-examine. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present (B absent): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present (C absent): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. But none of the answer choices reflect this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 2,6,3,9 \u2192 sum 20\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nOption C's ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculations. However, looking at the answer choices, option E has the same sum but different distribution. Wait, no\u2014they\u2019re all different. Option C's ratio is exactly what we derived. But looking back at the user's options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which aligns with our 9:3:3:1 ratio. So the correct answer should be option C.\n\nHowever, the original question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. According to our analysis, it's 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options sum to 16, which aligns with our calculations. Now, looking at the actual distribution: Phenotype A (red and brown): 9 parts\nPhenotype B (red and checkered): 3 parts\nPhenotype C (plain and brown): 3 parts\nPhenotype D (plain and checkered): 1 part Now, checking the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't fit\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 This matches exactly with our calculation\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be Option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo each option represents the count of each phenotype scaled by a factor such that the sum is 16. For example, option C is 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. This matches our calculation exactly. So the correct answer should reflect these counts. Looking at the options, option C states: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that's exactly what we have.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options add up to 16, which corresponds to the 16 possible combinations. Therefore, looking for the option that reflects the correct distribution. From our calculations, the correct distribution should be 9 parts for both traits (phenotype A), 3 parts for only C (B), 3 parts for only B (C), and 1 part for neither (D). But looking at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't match. Wait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake in mapping the letters. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the options, \"checkered red\" refers to the phenotype where both C and B are present (since C is present and B is present), which is Phenotype A.\n\nSimilarly, \"checkered brown\" would be when B is present but C is absent, which is Phenotype C.\n\nWait, no, according to our earlier breakdown:\n\n- Checkered red: C present and B present (Phenotype A)\n- Checkered brown: C present and B absent (Phenotype B)\n- Plain red: C absent and B present (Phenotype C)\n- Plain brown: Neither present (Phenotype D)\n\nSo, checking the options:\n\nOption C states:\n\n- checkered red: 9\n- checkered brown:3\n- plain red:3\n- plain brown:1\n\nWhich aligns with Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. That's exactly what Option C says. But wait, does that match our earlier conclusion? Yes, because Phenotype A is 9, B is 3, C is 3, and D is 1. So Option C seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB.8,4,0,4\u2192 sum16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192 sum16\nSo option C is exactly what we've calculated: 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown.

Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": ". Hmmm, so option A would imply 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown.",
    "rollout": ". Hmmm, so option A would imply 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown. Which corresponds to 9/16 vs 3/16, etc. But according to our calculations, the proportions should be 9:3:3:1, so option A fits that. But let me double-check my reasoning. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Another approach: Using Punnett squares for each gene and then combining them. For the C locus: 3/4 red, 1/4 plain. For the B locus: 3/4 brown, 1/4 checkered. Assuming independence, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n- Both traits present: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Only C: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Only B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Neither: (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option A states 6,2,6,2, which also sums to 16. Hmm, discrepancy here. Did I miscalculate somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me reconsider. For the C locus: Pigment color is determined by C. If the bird has at least one C allele, it's red. If not, it's plain. Similarly, for B: Brown if at least one B, else checkered. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Now, for each bird, the combination of C and B dominance determines the phenotype.\n\nUsing the Punnett square approach for both genes together:\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nEach gene segregates independently, leading to the following possible genotypes for each bird:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nNow, combining these, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we need to consider the probabilities of each combination. Since each gene segregates independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B present\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined probability: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined probability: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: C absent, B absent\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, option A states the ratio as 6,2,6,2, which also sums to 16. Wait, but according to our calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question is asking for a simplified ratio or scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that the presence of a dominant allele leads to the expression of the trait, but if both genes are dominant, both traits are expressed. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of their combination. In that case, the phenotypic ratios remain 9:3:3:1. But none of the options exactly match this, except option E and others.\n\nWait, checking the options again:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nThat's a reversed order compared to what we have. Our calculation is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed. Option A is 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 which simplifies to 3:1:3:1, which doesn't match our ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, or perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me try another approach. Maybe instead of looking at each gene separately, I should look at the F2 generation's possible genotypes and then map those to phenotypes. \n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes for the C locus are: CC, Cc, cc. For the B locus: BB, Bb, bb. Combining these, the possible genotypes for each bird are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain and Brown (phenotype 2)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain and Brown (phenotype 2)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain and Brown (phenotype 2)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown (phenotype 2)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered (phenotype 4)\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype 2 (Plain and Brown): CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB \u2192 4 instances\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 2 instances\n\nWait, that sums to 3 + 4 + 2 = 9, but we only have 9 birds in the F2 generation. Wait, no\u2014each F2 bird comes from two parentals, so the total number of F2 individuals is 9 (since 3 x 3 = 9). Wait, no\u2014when you self a dihybrid (CcBb), the F2 generation consists of 9 birds, each with a unique genotype. So the counts should add up to 9.\n\nLooking back, in the F2, the number of each genotype should be:\n\n- 1 CC BB\n- 2 CC Bb\n- 1 CC bb\n- 2 Cc BB\n- 2 Cc Bb\n- 2 Cc bb\n- 1 cc BB\n- 2 cc Bb\n- 1 cc bb\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 16 birds, but that can't be right because a dihybrid cross should yield 9 offspring. Wait, no\u2014this is confusing. Wait, the dihybrid cross is between two heterozygotes, so the expected number of F2 birds is indeed 9. But when I count the genotypes, I get more than 9. Wait, no\u2014each F2 bird is formed by two parents, so the total number of F2 birds is the product of the number of each genotype. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Instead, focusing on the phenotypic distribution: Each bird's genotype maps to a phenotype. As previously, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red and Brown (phenotype 1): 3 instances\n- Plain and Brown (phenotype 2): 4 instances\n- Plain and Checkered (phenotype 4): 2 instances\n\nWait, but 3 + 4 + 2 = 9, which makes sense because there are 9 birds in the F2 generation. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:4:2. Converting this to a ratio relative to each other, it's 3:4:2. But none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 simplifies to 3:1:3:1 \u2192 Not matching.\nB. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Same as A.\nC. 6,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nD. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Same as A.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal ratio.\nG. 6,12,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal ratio.\nL. None of the above.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to fit the 3:4:2 ratio. But option A is 6:2:6:2, which is twice the correct ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of birds in each phenotype.\n\nWait, going back: In the F2 generation, for the C locus, each bird has a 75% chance of having C present (since 3/4) and 25% for cc. For the B locus, same: 3/4 for B present, 1/4 for bb. Since the two genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\n- Both traits present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Only C: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Only B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Neither: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 birds. So the counts would be 9,3,3,1. But the options don't have this. The closest is option E, which is 3,9,1,3, but that's the reverse order. Wait, unless the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype without considering the exact ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options.\n\nGiven the options provided, the only one that aligns with the idea that some phenotypes are more frequent than others is option E, which lists checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown as 3,9,1,3 respectively. But according to our calculation, checkered red (plain red) should be 1 bird, while checkered brown should be 3. So the ratio would be 1:3:3:1, which doesn't match any option exactly. However, option E has 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, and 3 plain brown. Wait, that would mean checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which contradicts our calculation. So perhaps option E is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the phenotypes in a different order or perhaps I have a misunderstanding. Another possibility is that the question refers to the number of checkered and plain birds, not the ratio of red and brown. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nWait, the options describe the phenotypes as \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", \"plain red\", \"plain brown\". So the user wants the counts for each phenotype. According to our previous calculation, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (plain red): 1 bird\n- Checkered brown (plain brown): 3 birds\n- Plain red (red brown): 9 birds\n- Plain brown (red brown): 3 birds\n\nThus, the ratio would be 1:3:9:3. But looking at the options, none of them match this exact ratio. The closest is option E, which lists 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse of what we expect for checkered red and checkered brown.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since I have to choose from the given options, I need to select the best fit. Alternatively, maybe the user meant to ask for the ratio of red to brown, but that's not what's asked. The question clearly asks for the phenotypic ratio: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, none perfectly match the expected 1:3:9:3. However, option E provides 3,9,1,3, which may represent the number of birds in checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown respectively. But according to our calculation, checkered red should be 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, and plain brown 3. So option E seems to flip the checkered red and plain red counts, making it 3 and 9, which doesn't align with our expectation. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match, but perhaps option E is intended to represent the number of birds with each phenotype, regardless of order. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the options. \n\nBut given the options, the closest in terms of ratios is option E, which has 3,9,1,3, but this represents checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), and plain brown (3). This doesn't match our calculation, but perhaps the user intended the options differently. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the number of birds in each phenotype group irrespective of their dominance status, which might not be standard. Without further information, I think the intended answer might be option E, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. Hmmm, so option A would imply 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown. Which corresponds to 9/16 vs 3/16, etc. But according to our calculations, the proportions should be 9:3:3:1, so option A fits that. But let me double-check my reasoning. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Another approach: Using Punnett squares for each gene and then combining them. For the C locus: 3/4 red, 1/4 plain. For the B locus: 3/4 brown, 1/4 checkered. Assuming independence, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n- Both traits present: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Only C: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Only B: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Neither: (1/4)^2 = 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option A states 6,2,6,2, which also sums to 16. Hmm, discrepancy here. Did I miscalculate somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me reconsider. For the C locus: Pigment color is determined by C. If the bird has at least one C allele, it's red. If not, it's plain. Similarly, for B: Brown if at least one B, else checkered. So the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Now, for each bird, the combination of C and B dominance determines the phenotype.\n\nUsing the Punnett square approach for both genes together:\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nEach gene segregates independently, leading to the following possible genotypes for each bird:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nNow, combining these, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is dominant. Let's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C present, B present \u2192 Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown\n4. C absent, B absent \u2192 Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered\n\nTo find the frequency of each phenotype, we need to consider the probabilities of each combination. Since each gene segregates independently, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B present\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined probability: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent\n- Probability of C present: 3/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: C absent, B present\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B present: 3/4\n- Combined probability: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: C absent, B absent\n- Probability of C absent: 1/4\n- Probability of B absent: 1/4\n- Combined probability: (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, option A states the ratio as 6,2,6,2, which also sums to 16. Wait, but according to our calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps the question is asking for a simplified ratio or scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that the presence of a dominant allele leads to the expression of the trait, but if both genes are dominant, both traits are expressed. So, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of their combination. In that case, the phenotypic ratios remain 9:3:3:1. But none of the options exactly match this, except option E and others.\n\nWait, checking the options again:\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\n\nThat's a reversed order compared to what we have. Our calculation is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed. Option A is 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 which simplifies to 3:1:3:1, which doesn't match our ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, or perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me try another approach. Maybe instead of looking at each gene separately, I should look at the F2 generation's possible genotypes and then map those to phenotypes. \n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes for the C locus are: CC, Cc, cc. For the B locus: BB, Bb, bb. Combining these, the possible genotypes for each bird are:\n\n- CC BB\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC Bb \u2192 Red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain and Brown (phenotype 2)\n- Cc BB \u2192 Red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain and Brown (phenotype 2)\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain and Brown (phenotype 2)\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown (phenotype 2)\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered (phenotype 4)\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 instances\n- Phenotype 2 (Plain and Brown): CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, cc BB \u2192 4 instances\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): cc Bb, cc bb \u2192 2 instances\n\nWait, that sums to 3 + 4 + 2 = 9, but we only have 9 birds in the F2 generation. Wait, no\u2014each F2 bird comes from two parentals, so the total number of F2 individuals is 9 (since 3 x 3 = 9). Wait, no\u2014when you self a dihybrid (CcBb), the F2 generation consists of 9 birds, each with a unique genotype. So the counts should add up to 9.\n\nLooking back, in the F2, the number of each genotype should be:\n\n- 1 CC BB\n- 2 CC Bb\n- 1 CC bb\n- 2 Cc BB\n- 2 Cc Bb\n- 2 Cc bb\n- 1 cc BB\n- 2 cc Bb\n- 1 cc bb\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 16 birds, but that can't be right because a dihybrid cross should yield 9 offspring. Wait, no\u2014this is confusing. Wait, the dihybrid cross is between two heterozygotes, so the expected number of F2 birds is indeed 9. But when I count the genotypes, I get more than 9. Wait, no\u2014each F2 bird is formed by two parents, so the total number of F2 birds is the product of the number of each genotype. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Instead, focusing on the phenotypic distribution: Each bird's genotype maps to a phenotype. As previously, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red and Brown (phenotype 1): 3 instances\n- Plain and Brown (phenotype 2): 4 instances\n- Plain and Checkered (phenotype 4): 2 instances\n\nWait, but 3 + 4 + 2 = 9, which makes sense because there are 9 birds in the F2 generation. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:4:2. Converting this to a ratio relative to each other, it's 3:4:2. But none of the options match this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 simplifies to 3:1:3:1 \u2192 Not matching.\nB. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Same as A.\nC. 6,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nD. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Same as A.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal ratio.\nG. 6,12,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Equal ratio.\nL. None of the above.\n\nHmm, none of the options seem to fit the 3:4:2 ratio. But option A is 6:2:6:2, which is twice the correct ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the number of birds in each phenotype.\n\nWait, going back: In the F2 generation, for the C locus, each bird has a 75% chance of having C present (since 3/4) and 25% for cc. For the B locus, same: 3/4 for B present, 1/4 for bb. Since the two genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\n- Both traits present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Only C: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Only B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Neither: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 birds. So the counts would be 9,3,3,1. But the options don't have this. The closest is option E, which is 3,9,1,3, but that's the reverse order. Wait, unless the question is considering the number of birds with each phenotype without considering the exact ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options.\n\nGiven the options provided, the only one that aligns with the idea that some phenotypes are more frequent than others is option E, which lists checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown as 3,9,1,3 respectively. But according to our calculation, checkered red (plain red) should be 1 bird, while checkered brown should be 3. So the ratio would be 1:3:3:1, which doesn't match any option exactly. However, option E has 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, and 3 plain brown. Wait, that would mean checkered red is 3, checkered brown is 9, which contradicts our calculation. So perhaps option E is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the phenotypes in a different order or perhaps I have a misunderstanding. Another possibility is that the question refers to the number of checkered and plain birds, not the ratio of red and brown. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nWait, the options describe the phenotypes as \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", \"plain red\", \"plain brown\". So the user wants the counts for each phenotype. According to our previous calculation, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red (plain red): 1 bird\n- Checkered brown (plain brown): 3 birds\n- Plain red (red brown): 9 birds\n- Plain brown (red brown): 3 birds\n\nThus, the ratio would be 1:3:9:3. But looking at the options, none of them match this exact ratio. The closest is option E, which lists 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse of what we expect for checkered red and checkered brown.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but since I have to choose from the given options, I need to select the best fit. Alternatively, maybe the user meant to ask for the ratio of red to brown, but that's not what's asked. The question clearly asks for the phenotypic ratio: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, none perfectly match the expected 1:3:9:3. However, option E provides 3,9,1,3, which may represent the number of birds in checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown respectively. But according to our calculation, checkered red should be 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, and plain brown 3. So option E seems to flip the checkered red and plain red counts, making it 3 and 9, which doesn't align with our expectation. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match, but perhaps option E is intended to represent the number of birds with each phenotype, regardless of order. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the options. \n\nBut given the options, the closest in terms of ratios is option E, which has 3,9,1,3, but this represents checkered red (3), checkered brown (9), plain red (1), and plain brown (3). This doesn't match our calculation, but perhaps the user intended the options differently. Alternatively, maybe the user is considering the number of birds in each phenotype group irrespective of their dominance status, which might not be standard. Without further information, I think the intended answer might be option E, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Option D sums to 12, so it's less than the total possible. The problem asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So among the options, A, B, C, and E are valid because their totals add up to 16. Now, looking at the actual probabilities: Phenotype A is 9/16, B is 3/16, C is 3/16, D is 1/16.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16\nD.1,7,1,3\u2192sum 12\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16\nSo options A, B, C, and E sum to 16. Option D sums to 12, so it's less than the total possible. The problem asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So among the options, A, B, C, and E are valid because their totals add up to 16. Now, looking at the actual probabilities: Phenotype A is 9/16, B is 3/16, C is 3/16, D is 1/16. So the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Which corresponds to option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nBut wait, checking the options again:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that's 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, matching our calculations. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the scale factor is applied differently. Wait, no\u2014the exact counts are 3,9,1,3, making the ratio 3:9:1:3, which is equivalent to 1:3:1/3:1. But that's not a neat ratio. However, in terms of the options, option E states 3:9:1:3, which aligns with our calculation. So the answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, but the question asks for phenotypic ratio, so 6:2:6:2 \u2192 checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Which would correspond to the 1:1:1:1 ratio scaled by 6. Alternatively, perhaps the scale factor is such that each category is multiplied by a certain number. But looking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, matching our calculations. So the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:1/3:1, but that's not standard. Alternatively, perhaps the scale factor is applied differently. Wait, no\u2014the exact counts are 3,9,1,3, making the ratio 3:9:1:3, which is equivalent to 1:3:1/3:1. But that's not a neat ratio. However, in terms of the options, option E states 3:9:1:3, which aligns with our calculation. So the answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo option C has 9,3,3,1\u2014which corresponds to Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. So the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, option C lists Phenotype A as checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). But according to our analysis, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, plain brown is 1. So option C matches this. However, the options list them as:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nWhich aligns with our calculations. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

However, looking back, the options are presented with the count for each phenotype. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the logic. Because each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, but the number of phenotypic classes depends on the interaction between the two genes. Let me try again. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: red and brown (let's call this Phenotype X)\n2. C present, B absent: red and checkered (Phenotype Y)\n3. C absent, B present: plain and brown (Phenotype Z)\n4. Neither: plain and checkered (Phenotype W)\n\nThe probabilities for each:\n\n- Phenotype X: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype Y: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype Z: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype W: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back at the options, option C is written as \"Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1.\" Wait, that's not matching. Wait, no\u2014option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our analysis, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype Y (red and checkered), which is 3/16. So checkered red should be 3, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, plain brown is 1. Which matches option C. But looking at the options, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That aligns with our conclusion. However, the options are labeled with letters, and the correct answer should reflect the ratio 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct option is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nSo option C sums to 16. But according to our calculations, the probabilities are 9,3,3,1, leading to option C. However, looking back, the options are presented with the count for each phenotype. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014that's not matching. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the logic. Because each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, but the number of phenotypic classes depends on the interaction between the two genes. Let me try again. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B: red and brown (let's call this Phenotype X)\n2. C present, B absent: red and checkered (Phenotype Y)\n3. C absent, B present: plain and brown (Phenotype Z)\n4. Neither: plain and checkered (Phenotype W)\n\nThe probabilities for each:\n\n- Phenotype X: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype Y: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype Z: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype W: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back at the options, option C is written as \"Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1.\" Wait, that's not matching. Wait, no\u2014option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our analysis, checkered red would correspond to Phenotype Y (red and checkered), which is 3/16. So checkered red should be 3, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, plain brown is 1. Which matches option C. But looking at the options, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That aligns with our conclusion. However, the options are labeled with letters, and the correct answer should reflect the ratio 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct option is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio. Based on our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options represent 16 possible offspring. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio. Based on our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. But looking back, I might have made a mistake because in reality, the phenotypic ratios for such traits often follow a 9:3:3:1 pattern, but sometimes simplified. However, the exact pheno ratio depends on whether the traits are linked or not, but since the genes are independent, the 9:3:3:1 applies.

Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB.8,4,0,4\u2192sum16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192sum16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum16\nSo all options sum to 16. So looking for the correct distribution among the options. From our calculations, Phenotype A (both traits) is 9/16, Phenotype B (only C) is 3/16, Phenotype C (only B) is 3/16, Phenotype D (none) is 1/16.\n\nNow, looking at the answer options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red (only C, no B) is 3/16, but in Option C, it's 9. Hmm, that might mean I've made a mistake. Let me re-examine. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation instead of F2, but the user specified F2. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the F1 dihybrid cross, but the user said F2. Wait, no\u2014the user wrote \"complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, perhaps I misread the question. The question starts with \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown by recessive b. So the parents are CC BB and cc bb. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the F2 generation is considered. So our previous analysis holds. According to the options, none exactly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but Option C is 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to (9:3:3:1)/4, giving 2.25 each. But our calculation shows 9/16, 3/16, etc., which correspond to 9,3,3,1 when scaled up by 16. So Option C matches our ratio exactly. But looking at the options, Option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that aligns with our 9:3:3:1 ratio.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "? Yes. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16.",
    "rollout": "? Yes. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16. D. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. E. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16.\n\nSo all options have a total of 16, implying that the scale factor is 1. Wait, but looking at the options, E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to our calculation: Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts \u2192 plain brown, Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts \u2192 checkered red. Wait, no\u2014the numbering may differ. Let's clarify:\n\nIn our calculation, Phenotype A (red and brown): 9 parts \u2192 red brown.\nPhenotype B (red only): 3 parts \u2192 red plain.\nPhenotype C (brown only): 3 parts \u2192 plain brown.\nPhenotype D (none): 1 part \u2192 plain red.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red (which would be Phenotype C) 3, checkered brown (which would be Phenotype B) 9, plain red (which would be Phenotype D) 1, plain brown (which would be Phenotype A) 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

    "rollout": " \u2192 same as above. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 also sums to 16. But looking at the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to Phenotype C (plain red) 1, Phenotype B (red brown) 3, Phenotype A (red checkered) 9, Phenotype D (plain checkered) 3. Wait, but in our earlier analysis, Phenotype A was both traits present (red and brown), which would correspond to checkered brown. Hmm, perhaps I got confused with the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nIn our notation:\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown (which is \"checkered brown\")\n- Phenotype B: Only C present \u2192 red and plain (since B is absent, so brown becomes plain)\n- Phenotype C: Only B present \u2192 plain and brown (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B \u2192 plain and plain (checkered checkered)\n\nSo according to our earlier calculation:\n- Phenotype A: Checkered brown (count:9)\n- Phenotype B: Red plain (count:3)\n- Phenotype C: Checkered brown (count:3)\n- Phenotype D: Plain checkered (count:1)\n\nBut in the options, I don't see an option that exactly reflects this.

So option E lists Phenotype D as 3, which is correct for checkered checkered. But wait, that conflicts with our earlier calculation where Phenotype D is plain checkered, which would have a count of 1. However, in the options, E assigns checkered red as 3, which aligns with our calculation because checkered red is the phenotype where neither C nor B is present. Wait, no\u2014if C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b), then the bird is plain and checkered. So checkered red would be the phenotype where C is present (red) and B is absent (checkered). Wait, no\u2014red is dominant over checkered, and checkered is dominant over plain. So, the presence of a dominant allele in a trait means that trait is expressed. Therefore, a bird with C present (red) and b present (checkered) would have both traits: red and checkered. Similarly, a bird with c (plain) and B (brown) would have both traits: plain and brown. Therefore, the correct mapping is:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both traits present \u2192 red and brown (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype B: Only C present \u2192 red and plain (checkered red)\n- Phenotype C: Only B present \u2192 plain and brown (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 plain and plain (checkered checkered)\n\nSo, according to our earlier calculations, the counts should be:\n- Phenotype A: 9 (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype B: 3 (checkered red)\n- Phenotype C: 3 (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype D: 1 (checkered checkered)\n\nBut none of the options perfectly reflect this except option E, which lists checkered red (Phenotype B) as 3, checkered brown (Phenotype A) as 9, plain red (Phenotype D) as 3, and plain brown (Phenotype C) as 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 same as above. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 also sums to 16. But looking at the options, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds to Phenotype C (plain red) 1, Phenotype B (red brown) 3, Phenotype A (red checkered) 9, Phenotype D (plain checkered) 3. Wait, but in our earlier analysis, Phenotype A was both traits present (red and brown), which would correspond to checkered brown. Hmm, perhaps I got confused with the terms. Let me clarify:\n\nIn our notation:\n- Phenotype A: Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown (which is \"checkered brown\")\n- Phenotype B: Only C present \u2192 red and plain (since B is absent, so brown becomes plain)\n- Phenotype C: Only B present \u2192 plain and brown (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype D: Neither C nor B \u2192 plain and plain (checkered checkered)\n\nSo according to our earlier calculation:\n- Phenotype A: Checkered brown (count:9)\n- Phenotype B: Red plain (count:3)\n- Phenotype C: Checkered brown (count:3)\n- Phenotype D: Plain checkered (count:1)\n\nBut in the options, I don't see an option that exactly reflects this. Wait, let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2\nB. 6,2,4,4\nC. 9,3,3,1\nD. 1,3,9,3\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nWait, option E says checkered red (which would be Phenotype D: plain checkered, count 3), checkered brown (Phenotype A: checkered brown, count 9), plain red (Phenotype B: red plain, count 3), plain brown (Phenotype C: plain brown, count 1). So option E lists Phenotype D as 3, which is correct for checkered checkered. But wait, that conflicts with our earlier calculation where Phenotype D is plain checkered, which would have a count of 1. However, in the options, E assigns checkered red as 3, which aligns with our calculation because checkered red is the phenotype where neither C nor B is present. Wait, no\u2014if C is recessive (c) and B is recessive (b), then the bird is plain and checkered. So checkered red would be the phenotype where C is present (red) and B is absent (checkered). Wait, no\u2014red is dominant over checkered, and checkered is dominant over plain. So, the presence of a dominant allele in a trait means that trait is expressed. Therefore, a bird with C present (red) and b present (checkered) would have both traits: red and checkered. Similarly, a bird with c (plain) and B (brown) would have both traits: plain and brown. Therefore, the correct mapping is:\n\n- Phenotype A: Both traits present \u2192 red and brown (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype B: Only C present \u2192 red and plain (checkered red)\n- Phenotype C: Only B present \u2192 plain and brown (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype D: Neither present \u2192 plain and plain (checkered checkered)\n\nSo, according to our earlier calculations, the counts should be:\n- Phenotype A: 9 (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype B: 3 (checkered red)\n- Phenotype C: 3 (checkered brown)\n- Phenotype D: 1 (checkered checkered)\n\nBut none of the options perfectly reflect this except option E, which lists checkered red (Phenotype B) as 3, checkered brown (Phenotype A) as 9, plain red (Phenotype D) as 3, and plain brown (Phenotype C) as 1. That matches exactly what we've calculated. Therefore, the correct answer should be option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Now, according to our calculations, Phenotype A (both traits present) is 9, Phenotype B (only C) is 3, Phenotype C (only B) is 3, Phenotype D (neither) is 1. But looking at the answer choices, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which corresponds exactly to our calculations.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": ", which fits.",
    "rollout": ", which fits. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16. D. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. E. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. All options sum to 16. But looking at the options, the answer needs to correspond to the actual distribution. From our calculations, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, but scaled up. However, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in F2. The options provided seem to present the ratios without scaling, implying that perhaps the scale factor is such that the sum is 16. So, for example, Option B is 8,4,0,4, which also sums to 16, but according to our calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the probabilities. Another approach is to list all possible combinations of the two genes and determine the phenotype for each:\n\n1. C and B: Phenotype A\n2. C and b: Phenotype B\n3. c and B: Phenotype C\n4. c and b: Phenotype D\n\nEach combination occurs with certain probabilities. For each gene, the probability of the dominant allele is higher than the recessive. So for each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, and B present is 3/4. The presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Only C present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is 1/16. Now, converting these probabilities to counts, if we assume 16 birds, we'd have 9 with both traits, 3 with only C, 3 with only B, and 1 without any traits. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But none of the options directly state this. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the recessive allele's effect, treating both as dominant, which would change the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in setting up the Punnett square. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. Each parent is CcBb (because CC BB is C=c, B=b, but wait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB, so C=c, B=b? Wait, no: Parent 1 is CC BB, so the alleles are C=C, B=B. So when crossed with cc bb, the F1 is Cc (for C) and Bb (for B). So the F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB, cb, cb, CB? Wait, no\u2014each parent can only give CB or cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, for the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cc: plain (c present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- bb: plain (c present) and checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3:3:1, but wait, that's not matching our previous analysis. Because:\n\n- Phenotype A: CC and Cc \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Phenotype B: cc \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype C: bb \u2192 25%\n\nSo the ratio is 2:1:1, but that contradicts our earlier analysis. Hmm, now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it will exhibit both traits. So for the C locus, a bird with C is red, regardless of B. For the B locus, a bird with B is brown, regardless of C. So a bird with both C and B will be red and brown (Phenotype A). A bird with only C will be red and checkered (Phenotype B). A bird with only B will be plain and brown (Phenotype C). A bird with neither will be plain and checkered (Phenotype D). So the phenotypic ratios are indeed 25% A, 25% B, 25% C, 25% D. But that can't be right because that would mean all phenotypes are equally represented, which doesn't align with the earlier 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it will display both traits. So for the C locus: if C is present, the bird is red. Similarly, for B: if B is present, the bird is brown. So the presence of either dominant allele for each trait results in the respective trait being expressed. Thus, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene has a dominant allele. So:\n\n- Both C and B present: Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- C present, B absent: Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- C absent, B present: Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Both C and B absent: Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype A: Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (which is impossible because it would imply all birds have both traits)\nThis indicates a mistake in the initial assumption. Instead, the presence of each dominant allele increases the likelihood of the trait being expressed. So, the actual probabilities should be calculated based on the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nLet me recast the Punnett square correctly, considering that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either or both genes. The correct approach is to look at each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nEach gene has three possible phenotypes, but since each bird has two independent genes, the overall phenotypic ratios can be derived by considering the combinations of the two traits.\n\nHowever, this is getting complicated. Perhaps it's easier to refer to standard Mendelian ratios. For two loci with two alleles each, the phenotypic ratio for complete dominance (where the presence of a dominant allele hides the recessive one) would be 9:3:3:1, but that assumes that the recessive alleles are completely masked, which may not apply here since both genes are affecting pigmentation and body color.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to the expression of those traits. So the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the respective trait being expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. This means that a bird will have both traits if it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. The ratio of phenotypes would then be 25% for both, 25% for only the first trait, 25% for only the second trait, and 25% for neither. But this doesn't align with the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me instead consider the actual possible phenotypes and their probabilities based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has two copies of each gene. For the C gene, the possible alleles are C and c, and similarly for B. The probability of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B gene.\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nCalculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4 chance for C) * (3/4 chance for B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (3/4 chance for C) * (1/4 chance for b) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (1/4 chance for c) * (3/4 chance for B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (1/4 chance for c) * (1/4 chance for b) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, this doesn't match any of the provided options. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nOption C presents the ratio as 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, which fits. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16. D. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. E. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. All options sum to 16. But looking at the options, the answer needs to correspond to the actual distribution. From our calculations, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, but scaled up. However, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in F2. The options provided seem to present the ratios without scaling, implying that perhaps the scale factor is such that the sum is 16. So, for example, Option B is 8,4,0,4, which also sums to 16, but according to our calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the probabilities. Another approach is to list all possible combinations of the two genes and determine the phenotype for each:\n\n1. C and B: Phenotype A\n2. C and b: Phenotype B\n3. c and B: Phenotype C\n4. c and b: Phenotype D\n\nEach combination occurs with certain probabilities. For each gene, the probability of the dominant allele is higher than the recessive. So for each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, and B present is 3/4. The presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. Only C present is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. Only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. Neither is 1/16. Now, converting these probabilities to counts, if we assume 16 birds, we'd have 9 with both traits, 3 with only C, 3 with only B, and 1 without any traits. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But none of the options directly state this. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the recessive allele's effect, treating both as dominant, which would change the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in setting up the Punnett square. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly. Each parent is CcBb (because CC BB is C=c, B=b, but wait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB, so C=c, B=b? Wait, no: Parent 1 is CC BB, so the alleles are C=C, B=B. So when crossed with cc bb, the F1 is Cc (for C) and Bb (for B). So the F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB, cb, cb, CB? Wait, no\u2014each parent can only give CB or cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, for the phenotypes:\n\n- CC: red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Cc: red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- cc: plain (c present) and brown (B present) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- bb: plain (c present) and checkered (b present) \u2192 Phenotype C\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 3:3:1, but wait, that's not matching our previous analysis. Because:\n\n- Phenotype A: CC and Cc \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Phenotype B: cc \u2192 25%\n- Phenotype C: bb \u2192 25%\n\nSo the ratio is 2:1:1, but that contradicts our earlier analysis. Hmm, now I'm confused. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it will exhibit both traits. So for the C locus, a bird with C is red, regardless of B. For the B locus, a bird with B is brown, regardless of C. So a bird with both C and B will be red and brown (Phenotype A). A bird with only C will be red and checkered (Phenotype B). A bird with only B will be plain and brown (Phenotype C). A bird with neither will be plain and checkered (Phenotype D). So the phenotypic ratios are indeed 25% A, 25% B, 25% C, 25% D. But that can't be right because that would mean all phenotypes are equally represented, which doesn't align with the earlier 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for each trait, it will display both traits. So for the C locus: if C is present, the bird is red. Similarly, for B: if B is present, the bird is brown. So the presence of either dominant allele for each trait results in the respective trait being expressed. Thus, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene has a dominant allele. So:\n\n- Both C and B present: Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- C present, B absent: Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- C absent, B present: Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Both C and B absent: Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype A: Probability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (which is impossible because it would imply all birds have both traits)\nThis indicates a mistake in the initial assumption. Instead, the presence of each dominant allele increases the likelihood of the trait being expressed. So, the actual probabilities should be calculated based on the independent assortment of the two genes.\n\nLet me recast the Punnett square correctly, considering that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either or both genes. The correct approach is to look at each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nEach gene has three possible phenotypes, but since each bird has two independent genes, the overall phenotypic ratios can be derived by considering the combinations of the two traits.\n\nHowever, this is getting complicated. Perhaps it's easier to refer to standard Mendelian ratios. For two loci with two alleles each, the phenotypic ratio for complete dominance (where the presence of a dominant allele hides the recessive one) would be 9:3:3:1, but that assumes that the recessive alleles are completely masked, which may not apply here since both genes are affecting pigmentation and body color.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to the expression of those traits. So the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene results in the respective trait being expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. This means that a bird will have both traits if it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. The ratio of phenotypes would then be 25% for both, 25% for only the first trait, 25% for only the second trait, and 25% for neither. But this doesn't align with the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me instead consider the actual possible phenotypes and their probabilities based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has two copies of each gene. For the C gene, the possible alleles are C and c, and similarly for B. The probability of each genotype is:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nSimilarly for the B gene.\n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A (red and brown)\n- C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B (red and checkered)\n- C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C (plain and brown)\n- Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n\nCalculating the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: (3/4 chance for C) * (3/4 chance for B) = 9/16\n- Phenotype B: (3/4 chance for C) * (1/4 chance for b) = 3/16\n- Phenotype C: (1/4 chance for c) * (3/4 chance for B) = 3/16\n- Phenotype D: (1/4 chance for c) * (1/4 chance for b) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, this doesn't match any of the provided options. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nOption C presents the ratio as 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16. H.5,3,2,6\u2192sum 16. E.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16. So all options sum to 16. The question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio. From our analysis, the ratio is 9:3:3:1 for Phenotypes A:D:C:B respectively. So looking at the options:\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 which corresponds to Phenotype A:D:C:B.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is the reverse of Option C.\n\nSo which one is correct? The question states \"the expected phenotypic ratio\", without specifying the order. Looking at the options, Option C is 9,3,3,1, which aligns with our analysis.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. B.8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C.9,3,3,1\u2192 sum 16. D.1,3,9,3\u2192 sum 16. E.3,9,1,3\u2192 sum 16.\n\nLooking at the options, option C has a sum of 16, which matches our calculations. Option C states: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that aligns with our probabilities. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options sum to 16, which matches our calculation. But what do they represent? Let's clarify. The options list the phenotypes as:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. Checkered red 8, Checkered brown 4, Plain red 0, Plain brown 4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nEach option represents the count of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Now, according to our calculations, the proportions are 9:3:3:1 for Phenotype A:B:C:D respectively. However, looking at the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which typically lists the phenotypes in order, so the order matters. In our analysis, the phenotypes are ordered as A (both traits present), B (only C), C (only B), D (neither). So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes the order is based on the traits without considering dominance, but in this case, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the ratio should reflect the combined presence of both dominant alleles.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo the correct distribution is option C: 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking back, I thought the probabilities were 9,3,3,1 for the phenotypes, but according to the options, option C matches this exactly. Wait, but the options list them as:\n\nC.

Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16? Wait, 6+2+6+2=16. Yes! So the answer is A. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192sum16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum16\nSo the actual counts would be scaled versions. For instance, option C has 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc. But according to our calculations, the number of checkered red is 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which corresponds to option C. So the answer would be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 but the counts are higher than others. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 but this leaves zero for plain red and plain brown. C. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 fits our calculation. D. 1,7,5,3 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 no. E. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 no, wait E is 3,9,1,3, which adds up to 16. Wait, but according to our calculations, the distribution should be 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to option C. But looking at the options, option C is Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that aligns with our calculation.

Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB.8,4,0,4\u2192sum16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192sum16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum16\nSo according to our calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 but the fraction is 6/16=3/8 for each.\nBut according to our calculations, the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, no, because in our earlier breakdown, the phenotypes were:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 parts\n- Phenotype B: 3 parts\n- Phenotype C: 3 parts\n- Phenotype D: 1 part\n\nSo the counts would be proportional to these, scaled by a factor. The options given are:\n\nOption E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which aligns with 3:9:1:3. But that's exactly what we have.\n\nWait, no, in our earlier analysis, the count was:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9 parts \u2192 9\n- Phenotype B: 3 \u2192 3\n- Phenotype C: 3 \u2192 3\n- Phenotype D: 1 \u21921\n\nSo scaling by a factor of 1 would give us 9,3,3,1, which matches option E.\n\nAlternatively, looking back, the options provided include:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nWhich corresponds to 3:9:1:3, matching our calculation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options add up to 16. Now, according to our calculations, the phenotypic distribution should be 9 (A), 3 (B), 3 (C), 1 (D). Which corresponds to option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nBut looking back at the options, option C states: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That matches our calculation. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo according to this, option C is correct, with 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. But wait, that would mean the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n\nHowever, looking back at the problem statement, the parents are CC BB and cc bb.

Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "? No, 6+2+6+2=16.",

Wait, but in reality, according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. So looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Which corresponds to checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nYes, that's exactly what option E states.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16? No, 6+2+6+2=16. Wait, but the phenotypic ratio presented in option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Summing to 16. Wait, but in reality, according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. So looking at the options:\n\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 Which corresponds to checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nYes, that's exactly what option E states.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.",

So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But looking back, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. So according to our calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options add up to 16, which corresponds to 9+3+3+1=16. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. But looking back, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio for the F2 generation. So according to our calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1. But let me double-check because sometimes people confuse the order.\n\nWait, in our classification:\n- Phenotype A: both traits present \u2192 checkered red and brown\n- Phenotype B: only C present \u2192 checkered red and plain\n- Phenotype C: only B present \u2192 plain red and brown\n- Phenotype D: neither present \u2192 plain red and plain\nLooking back at the options, option C states: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't match our calculation because our D phenotype was plain and plain (plain red?), but according to our earlier breakdown, D is plain and plain, which would correspond to \"plain\" in the options.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes.

For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele).

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "B.8,4,0,4\u2192sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16",

Now, according to our calculation, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back, I realize that the initial assumption may have been wrong regarding the dominance hierarchy. Wait, no\u2014the dominant alleles are expressed regardless of the other. So the ratio should indeed be 9:3:3:1, making option C correct. But let me double-check. Another way to look at it is through a Punnett square for each trait separately and then combining them. For pigment color (C/B), the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly for body color (B/b):\n\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nSince these are independent, the combined phenotypes are determined by the combination of these. So the Punnett square would have 16 possible outcomes, grouped into the four phenotypes as follows:\n\n- Both C and B present: 9 outcomes\n- Only C present: 3 outcomes\n- Only B present: 3 outcomes\n- Neither present: 1 outcome\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

However, looking back, I realize that the initial assumption may have been wrong regarding the dominance hierarchy. Wait, no\u2014the dominant alleles are expressed regardless of the other.

Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

But looking at the exact counts: Our calculations gave us 9,3,3,1. So the correct answer would be C, which states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": ". B.8,4,0,4\u2192sum 16.",
    "rollout": ". B.8,4,0,4\u2192sum 16. C.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16. D.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16. E.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16.\n\nSo the correct answer should reflect the probabilities we've calculated, which is 9 parts for both traits, 3 parts for only C, 3 parts for only B, and 1 part for neither. But looking at the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which aligns perfectly with what we have. However, I thought earlier that option C was correct, but I initially thought option H was correct. Wait, let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 16\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 16\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 16\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16\n\nYes, option C matches our calculations. But wait, in the initial analysis, I thought the correct answer was option H, which had 5,3,2,6. That must have been a miscalculation. Let me double-check the probabilities. For a bird, the probability of having both traits is 9/16, only C is 3/16, only B is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Multiplying by the number of offspring, say 16, we get 9,3,3,1. So option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. B.8,4,0,4\u2192sum 16. C.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16. D.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16. E.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16.\n\nSo the correct answer should reflect the probabilities we've calculated, which is 9 parts for both traits, 3 parts for only C, 3 parts for only B, and 1 part for neither. But looking at the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which aligns perfectly with what we have. However, I thought earlier that option C was correct, but I initially thought option H was correct. Wait, let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions:\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 16\nB.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": ", which matches.",
    "rollout": ", which matches. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me double-check. The F2 phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red (both C and B): 9 parts\n- Checkered brown (C only): 3 parts\n- Plain red (B only): 3 parts\n- Plain brown (neither): 1 part\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option A (6,2,6,2) or option E (3,9,1,3). Wait, no\u2014the options are presented as A through H, each with different ratios. Let me look at the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16 total\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\nOption D: 1,7,5,3 \u2192 16\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypic classes. Let me re-examine. The phenotypic classes should be based on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: 9\n- C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B: 3\n- C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C: 3\n- Neither dominant \u2192 Phenotype D: 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. None of the options match exactly, but looking at the options, option C has 9,3,3,1, which fits perfectly. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown).

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, which matches. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me double-check. The F2 phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red (both C and B): 9 parts\n- Checkered brown (C only): 3 parts\n- Plain red (B only): 3 parts\n- Plain brown (neither): 1 part\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option A (6,2,6,2) or option E (3,9,1,3). Wait, no\u2014the options are presented as A through H, each with different ratios. Let me look at the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16 total\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 16\nOption D: 1,7,5,3 \u2192 16\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 16\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypic classes. Let me re-examine. The phenotypic classes should be based on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So:\n\n- C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Phenotype A: 9\n- C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Phenotype B: 3\n- C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C: 3\n- Neither dominant \u2192 Phenotype D: 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. None of the options match exactly, but looking at the options, option C has 9,3,3,1, which fits perfectly. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

E.3,9,1,3\u2192 sum 16, similar to option C.\n\nWait, looking back, the problem states \"the expected phenotypic ratio,\" so perhaps we're supposed to count the number of each phenotype without scaling, assuming N=16. But in reality, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but the options don't include 9:3:3:1 exactly. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which sums to 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also sums to 16. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, going back to the calculation: Phenotype A: 9 parts, B:3, C:3, D:1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options:\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo both options sum to 16.

However, sometimes in genetics, especially when dealing with two-trait problems, the phenotypic ratio can be simplified or represented differently. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The F2 generation includes four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The correct ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, so option C is correct. But looking at the options, option E also sums to 16. Hmm, perhaps I need to reconsider the initial assumption. Wait, no, because the phenotypic ratio in F2 for two independent traits is typically 9:3:3:1. So unless there's a simplification, option C should be correct. But why do some sources present it as 3:1:1:1? Oh, wait! Because in many cases, when counting phenotypes, people group together categories where the phenotype doesn't change. For example, in this case, if both traits are present, it's considered one phenotype; otherwise, others are grouped. But that grouping wouldn't apply here because each phenotype is distinct based on the presence or absence of each trait.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, but each category is 6. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16, but some categories zero. C.9,3,3,1\u2192 sum 16, but each is high. D.1,7,1,3\u2192 sum 12. E.3,9,1,3\u2192 sum 16, similar to option C.\n\nWait, looking back, the problem states \"the expected phenotypic ratio,\" so perhaps we're supposed to count the number of each phenotype without scaling, assuming N=16. But in reality, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but the options don't include 9:3:3:1 exactly. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which sums to 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also sums to 16. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, going back to the calculation: Phenotype A: 9 parts, B:3, C:3, D:1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options:\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo both options sum to 16. But the question asks for the expected ratio, so which one represents the correct distribution. Let's look at the options again:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u219216\nD.1,7,1,3 \u219212\nE.3,9,1,3 \u219216\n\nNow, according to our calculation, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, sometimes in genetics, especially when dealing with two-trait problems, the phenotypic ratio can be simplified or represented differently. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes. Let me double-check. The F2 generation includes four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The correct ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, so option C is correct. But looking at the options, option E also sums to 16. Hmm, perhaps I need to reconsider the initial assumption. Wait, no, because the phenotypic ratio in F2 for two independent traits is typically 9:3:3:1. So unless there's a simplification, option C should be correct. But why do some sources present it as 3:1:1:1? Oh, wait! Because in many cases, when counting phenotypes, people group together categories where the phenotype doesn't change. For example, in this case, if both traits are present, it's considered one phenotype; otherwise, others are grouped. But that grouping wouldn't apply here because each phenotype is distinct based on the presence or absence of each trait. So I think the correct answer is option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options sum to 16, which corresponds to the 9+3+3+1 distribution. Now, looking back, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. Because option C lists Phenotype A:9, B:3, C:3, D:1. Which matches our calculations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options have a sum of 16, which makes sense because the 16 parts correspond to the 16 possible phenotypic categories. But looking at the options, the letters correspond to the order: A is checkered red 6, etc. But according to our calculations, Phenotype C (plain and brown) should occur 3 times, which is option B. Wait, but the options don't align perfectly. Let me double-check. The probabilities were:\n\n- A: 9/16 \u2192 ~9 parts\n- B: 3/16 \u2192 ~3 parts\n- C: 3/16 \u2192 ~3 parts\n- D: 1/16 \u2192 ~1 part\n\nIf we take N=16, then Counts would be:\n\nA: 9\n\nB: 3\n\nC: 3\n\nD: 1\n\nWhich corresponds to option B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16. Hmm, no, that's not matching exactly. Option B says checkered red 8, which doesn't match our 9. Option C has 9,3,3,1 \u2192 which matches our 9,3,3,1. So option C would have Phenotype A: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nThat's exactly what we've calculated. So the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. B.8,4,0,4\u2192sum 16. C.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16. D.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16. E.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16. So all options add up to 16. But looking at the question, it asks for the phenotypic ratio. Option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our analysis, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype D: 1 part\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype B: 3 parts\n- Plain red: Phenotype C: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A: 9 parts\n\nSo the ratio is 1:3:3:9. Which corresponds to option C. Alternatively, sometimes ratios are presented without the denominators adding up to 16, but in reality, it's 1:3:3:9, so the correct ratio is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16. D.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. E.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. So all options represent 16 total birds. Now, according to our calculations, Phenotype A (red and brown) would be 9/16, Phenotype B (red and checkered) 3/16, Phenotype C (plain and brown) 3/16, Phenotype D (plain and checkered) 1/16. Therefore, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 9,3,3,1. Yes, that matches. But wait, in the options, option C is written as \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". That aligns with our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16\nSo all options sum to 16. But according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back, the options might represent the count in terms of phenotypes without the denominator. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. So option C states exactly that: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. So the answer should be C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nSo looking at option C, it matches our calculations. Phenotype A: checkered red 9 parts, which corresponds to 9 birds. Phenotype B: plain red 3, which is 3 birds. Phenotype C: plain brown 3, which is 3 birds. Phenotype D: checkered brown 1, which is 1 bird. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back at the options, option C states: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no, that's not matching. Because according to our calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which aligns exactly. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16\n\nSo according to our calculations, the correct distribution is 9 (A), 3 (B), 3 (C), 1 (D). Which corresponds to option C. However, looking back at the options, option C states: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that aligns with what we've calculated.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16; B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16; C.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16; D.1,7,1,3\u2192sum 12; E.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16. Hmm, so all options except D add up to 16. But according to our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back, option C is checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that's 9+3+3+1=16. Yes, that fits. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16. D.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16. E.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16. All add up to 16, so the correct answer should reflect one of these. Now, looking back, the phenotypic ratio in terms of phenotypic count would be 9:3:3:1. But none of the options exactly match this. Wait, option E is 3:9:1:3, which also sums to 16. Hmm, but according to our calculations, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, but option E is 3:9:1:3, which is the same as our calculation but reversed. Wait, perhaps I've mixed up the order. Let me double-check. Our phenotypes were:\n\nA. Both traits: red and brown\nB. Only C: red and checkered\nC. Only B: plain and brown\nD. Neither: plain and checkered\n\nSo the counts should correspond to the probabilities: 9,3,3,1. But in option E, it's 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to only B, only C, both, neither. So the order matters. Option E lists checkered red (only B), checkered brown (only C), plain red (both), plain brown (neither). Which matches our order. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB.8,4,0,4\u2192 sum16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192 sum16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum16\nSo each option represents the counts for each phenotype in terms of parts of 16. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so the answer should reflect the count of each phenotype relative to each other. For instance, in option C, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, plain brown is 1. This corresponds to Phenotype C: 3 parts, B:9 parts, D:1 part, A:3 parts. Wait, but according to our calculations, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\nPhenotype A: 9\nPhenotype B: 3\nPhenotype C: 3\nPhenotype D: 1\n\nBut looking at the options, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Which would correspond to Phenotype B:9, A:3, D:3, C:1. Hmm, that's inconsistent with our previous reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes. Let me re-examine. The four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. Only C present \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. Only B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Neither present \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered\n\nAccording to the Punnett square analysis, the probabilities are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThus, in terms of counts, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. But looking at the options, option C has 9:3:3:1, which aligns with this. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that's exactly what option C shows. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. B.8,4,0,4\u2192sum 16. C.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16. D.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16. E.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16. So all options add up to 16. But the question asks for the ratio, so perhaps we need to present them as 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. Alternatively, looking at the answer choices, option C states \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Which aligns with 9:3:3:1, the classic dihybrid ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C.9,3,3,1\u2192 sum 16. D.1,3,9,3\u2192 sum 16. E.3,9,1,3\u2192 sum 16. So all options sum to 16, which corresponds to 9+3+3+1=16. But the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio. From our analysis, the ratio is Phenotype A : B : C : D = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, which corresponds to checkered red (A), checkered brown (B), plain red (C), plain brown (D). Looking at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which doesn't match our 3 for plain red. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That also doesn't match our 9 for checkered brown. Option C has checkered brown 3 instead of 3 (which is correct) and plain red 3 instead of 3 (correct). Wait, no, in option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that's inconsistent because according to our calculations, checkered brown is 3 (Phenotype B), and plain red is 3 (Phenotype C). But according to the options, option C lists checkered brown as 3 and plain red as 3, which matches our calculation. Wait, no, the options are:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nYes, that's exactly what we calculated. Because:\n\n- Phenotype A: checkered red \u2192 9\n- Phenotype B: checkered brown \u2192 3\n- Phenotype C: plain red \u2192 3\n- Phenotype D: plain brown \u2192 1\n\nSo the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB.8,4,0,4\u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192 sum 16\n\nSo all options sum to 16, which corresponds to the possible counts for each phenotype. Now, looking back at the calculations, the correct counts should be 9,3,3,1 for Phenotypes A, B, C, D respectively. Which matches option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n\nBut wait, according to the initial analysis, the correct phenotypic distribution should be 9:3:3:1, matching option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": ", but their counts are higher.",
    "rollout": ", but their counts are higher. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16. D. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. E. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. So all options add up to 16. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 corresponds to Phenotype C: 3, Phenotype B:9, Phenotype A:9, Phenotype D:3. Wait, but according to our analysis, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9 parts, Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 3, Phenotype C (plain and brown) is 3, Phenotype D (plain and checkered) is 1.\n\nSo the order is checkered red (Phenotype C?), checkered brown (Phenotype B?), plain red (Phenotype A?), plain brown (Phenotype D?) Wait, no\u2014the phenotypes are ordered as follows: checkered red is when both C and B are recessive, so that's Phenotype D (plain and checkered). Checkered brown is when C is dominant, B is recessive: Phenotype B. Plain red is when both are dominant: Phenotype A. Plain brown is when neither is dominant: Phenotype D. Wait, no\u2014that contradicts. Let me clarify:\n\nNo, wait. Phenotype D is plain and checkered: both C and B are recessive. Phenotype B is red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive. Phenotype A is red and brown: C and B dominant. Phenotype C is plain and brown: C recessive, B dominant. So the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Plain and checkered: 1 part\n- Red and checkered: 3 parts\n- Red and brown: 9 parts\n- Plain and brown: 3 parts\n\nLooking at the options, option C says: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which aligns with our analysis. Because checkered red is when both are recessive: 1 part. Checkered brown is when C dominant, B recessive: 3 parts. Plain red is when C recessive, B dominant: 3 parts. Plain brown is when both recessive: 9 parts. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, but their counts are higher. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16. D. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16. E. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16. So all options add up to 16. But the question asks for the phenotypic ratio. Let's look at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 corresponds to Phenotype C: 3, Phenotype B:9, Phenotype A:9, Phenotype D:3. Wait, but according to our analysis, Phenotype A (red and brown) is 9 parts, Phenotype B (red and checkered) is 3, Phenotype C (plain and brown) is 3, Phenotype D (plain and checkered) is 1.\n\nSo the order is checkered red (Phenotype C?), checkered brown (Phenotype B?), plain red (Phenotype A?), plain brown (Phenotype D?) Wait, no\u2014the phenotypes are ordered as follows: checkered red is when both C and B are recessive, so that's Phenotype D (plain and checkered). Checkered brown is when C is dominant, B is recessive: Phenotype B. Plain red is when both are dominant: Phenotype A. Plain brown is when neither is dominant: Phenotype D. Wait, no\u2014that contradicts. Let me clarify:\n\nNo, wait. Phenotype D is plain and checkered: both C and B are recessive. Phenotype B is red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive. Phenotype A is red and brown: C and B dominant. Phenotype C is plain and brown: C recessive, B dominant. So the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Plain and checkered: 1 part\n- Red and checkered: 3 parts\n- Red and brown: 9 parts\n- Plain and brown: 3 parts\n\nLooking at the options, option C says: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which aligns with our analysis. Because checkered red is when both are recessive: 1 part. Checkered brown is when C dominant, B recessive: 3 parts. Plain red is when C recessive, B dominant: 3 parts. Plain brown is when both recessive: 9 parts. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true.

Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.",
    "rollout": "\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 2,6,3,9 \u2192 sum 20\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo option C sums to 16, matching our calculations. But looking at the options, the phenotypic ratio given in option C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which corresponds to Phenotypes C and D (plain red and plain brown) having 3 and 1 respectively, while Phenotypes B and A (only C and both traits) have 3 and 9 respectively. Wait, but according to our calculations, Phenotype A is 9, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1. So the ratio would be 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D. So the order of the phenotypes in the answer options matters. Option C lists them as checkered red (phenotype C?), checkered brown (phenotype D?), plain red (phenotype B?), plain brown (phenotype A?) Hmm, perhaps the option labels are inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps I've misassigned the phenotypes. Let me re-express the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype D (neither C nor B)\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype B (only C)\n- Plain red: Phenotype C (only B)\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A (both C and B)\n\nThus, the ratio would be Plain red : Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain brown = 3 : 9 : 3 : 1. Which is option C: \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, but option C is written as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which aligns with this ratio. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 2,6,3,9 \u2192 sum 20\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo option C sums to 16, matching our calculations. But looking at the options, the phenotypic ratio given in option C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which corresponds to Phenotypes C and D (plain red and plain brown) having 3 and 1 respectively, while Phenotypes B and A (only C and both traits) have 3 and 9 respectively. Wait, but according to our calculations, Phenotype A is 9, Phenotype B is 3, Phenotype C is 3, Phenotype D is 1. So the ratio would be 9:A, 3:B, 3:C, 1:D. So the order of the phenotypes in the answer options matters. Option C lists them as checkered red (phenotype C?), checkered brown (phenotype D?), plain red (phenotype B?), plain brown (phenotype A?) Hmm, perhaps the option labels are inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps I've misassigned the phenotypes. Let me re-express the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: Phenotype D (neither C nor B)\n- Checkered brown: Phenotype B (only C)\n- Plain red: Phenotype C (only B)\n- Plain brown: Phenotype A (both C and B)\n\nThus, the ratio would be Plain red : Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain brown = 3 : 9 : 3 : 1. Which is option C: \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, but option C is written as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which aligns with this ratio.

For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

So the expected phenotypic distribution should be approximately 9:3:3:1. Therefore, among the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which fits.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": ", but the ratios are 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1.",
    "rollout": ", but the ratios are 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But according to our calculation, it's 9:3:3:1. So none of the options exactly match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the four phenotypes, not the absolute counts. So looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 = 3:1:3:1\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 = 2:1:0:1\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\nOption D: 1,7,5,1 \u2192 1:7:5:1\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3, but that's inconsistent with our previous calculation.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 4:4:4:4\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 12:2:2:0\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5:3:2:6\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 7:5:1:3\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2:6:3:1\n\nOur calculation suggested 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Option C. However, looking back at the options, Option C states 9,3,3,1. But wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the four phenotypes without considering the absolute counts. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me double-check the phenotypic ratios. \n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n- Checkered red: when both C and B are present. According to our calculation, this happens 9/16 of the time. \n- Checkered brown: only C is present (not B) \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: only B is present (not C) \u2192 3/16\n- Plain brown: neither C nor B is present \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, Option C is 9,3,3,1. So that would correspond to option C. However, I need to ensure that I haven't missed anything else in the problem statement. Let me review the original question again.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options provided are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 3:1:3:1\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 2:1:0:1\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\nD. 1,7,5,1 \u2192 1:7:5:1\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All 4\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 12:2:2:0\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5:3:2:6\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 7:5:1:3\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2:6:3:1\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches Option C. However, I notice that the options presented do not include \"9:3:3:1\" as a choice, but Option C does. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me try recalculating the probabilities.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. The presence of C (for pigment) and B (for color) are independent. The probability of having at least one dominant allele for each gene is 3/4. Therefore, the combined probabilities are as follows:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer should be Option C. However, looking back, the options provided are labeled from A to J, with C being 9,3,3,1. Therefore, the correct answer is Option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, but the ratios are 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But according to our calculation, it's 9:3:3:1. So none of the options exactly match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the four phenotypes, not the absolute counts. So looking at the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 = 3:1:3:1\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 = 2:1:0:1\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\nOption D: 1,7,5,1 \u2192 1:7:5:1\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 which is 3:9:1:3, but that's inconsistent with our previous calculation.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 4:4:4:4\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 12:2:2:0\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5:3:2:6\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 7:5:1:3\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2:6:3:1\n\nOur calculation suggested 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Option C. However, looking back at the options, Option C states 9,3,3,1. But wait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio among the four phenotypes without considering the absolute counts. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me double-check the phenotypic ratios. \n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypes are:\n- Checkered red: when both C and B are present. According to our calculation, this happens 9/16 of the time. \n- Checkered brown: only C is present (not B) \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: only B is present (not C) \u2192 3/16\n- Plain brown: neither C nor B is present \u2192 1/16\n\nSo the ratios are 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, Option C is 9,3,3,1. So that would correspond to option C. However, I need to ensure that I haven't missed anything else in the problem statement. Let me review the original question again.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. The options provided are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 3:1:3:1\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 8:4:0:4 \u2192 2:1:0:1\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\nD. 1,7,5,1 \u2192 1:7:5:1\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3:9:1:3\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All 4\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 12:2:2:0\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5:3:2:6\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 7:5:1:3\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2:6:3:1\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches Option C. However, I notice that the options presented do not include \"9:3:3:1\" as a choice, but Option C does. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me try recalculating the probabilities.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. The presence of C (for pigment) and B (for color) are independent. The probability of having at least one dominant allele for each gene is 3/4. Therefore, the combined probabilities are as follows:\n\n- Both C and B present: (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n- Only C present: (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present: (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer should be Option C. However, looking back, the options provided are labeled from A to J, with C being 9,3,3,1. Therefore, the correct answer is Option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo the correct ratios are 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back at the options, option C is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Yes, that matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16? No, 6+2+6+2=16. Yes, so option A would represent the same as our calculation. But looking at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8,4,0,4\n\nC. 9,3,3,1\n\nD. 1,3,9,3\n\nE. 3,9,1,3\n\nSo, according to our analysis, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, let me double-check because sometimes the way phenotypes are counted can differ. Wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which is typically presented in terms of the number of birds in each phenotype category. Our analysis shows 9 (A), 3 (B), 3 (C), and 1 (D). So the order should correspond to the phenotypes as described. Option C states 9,3,3,1, which fits perfectly. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB.8,4,0,4\u2192sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16\nSo option C matches exactly. So the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

So now, looking at the actual answer choices:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sum 16. This fits because 6+2+6+2=16.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum 16. Fits too.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum 16. Also fits.\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16. Correct.\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16. Correct.\n\nNow, we need to know which of these is the correct ratio. To do that, let's go back to the F2 generation. From the Punnett square, the F2 would have the following distribution:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 of the birds.\n- Checkered brown: 3/16.\n- Plain red: 3/16.\n- Plain brown: 1/16.\n\nSo, if we take a large sample size, say 16 birds, we'd expect 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which aligns with the 1:3:3:1 ratio, but scaled down by a factor of 1/4? Wait, no, 3+9+1+3=16, which is correct. But according to our calculations, the probabilities are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. So among the options, which one reflects this? Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is exactly the inverse of what we've calculated because it starts with checkered red, then checkered brown, etc. But according to our analysis, the correct order is 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Which would correspond to option E if we reverse the order. Wait, but option E lists 3,9,1,3, which would mean 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc., which doesn't fit our calculations. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me re-examine the possible phenotypes and their probabilities. Each bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: Red and Brown (counted as checkered red)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: Red and Checkered (counted as checkered brown)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain and Brown (counted as plain red)\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and Checkered (counted as plain brown)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThus, in terms of counts, if we have 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- 9 checkered red\n- 3 checkered brown\n- 3 plain red\n- 1 plain brown\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse order. However, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio, not necessarily the order. So depending on the order, option E is the inverse of our count. But the options may not specify order, but in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Among the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which is the correct ratio. So the correct answer should reflect this without reversing. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9 checkered red : 3 checkered brown : 3 plain red : 1 plain brown, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. B.8,4,0,4\u2192sum 16. C.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16. D.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16. E.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16. All options sum to 16, which corresponds to the 16 parts we calculated. So now, looking at the actual answer choices:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sum 16. This fits because 6+2+6+2=16.\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 sum 16. Fits too.\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum 16. Also fits.\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum 16. Correct.\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16. Correct.\n\nNow, we need to know which of these is the correct ratio. To do that, let's go back to the F2 generation. From the Punnett square, the F2 would have the following distribution:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 of the birds.\n- Checkered brown: 3/16.\n- Plain red: 3/16.\n- Plain brown: 1/16.\n\nSo, if we take a large sample size, say 16 birds, we'd expect 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, and 1 plain brown. Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which aligns with the 1:3:3:1 ratio, but scaled down by a factor of 1/4? Wait, no, 3+9+1+3=16, which is correct. But according to our calculations, the probabilities are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. So among the options, which one reflects this? Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is exactly the inverse of what we've calculated because it starts with checkered red, then checkered brown, etc. But according to our analysis, the correct order is 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. Which would correspond to option E if we reverse the order. Wait, but option E lists 3,9,1,3, which would mean 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, etc., which doesn't fit our calculations. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me re-examine the possible phenotypes and their probabilities. Each bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 Phenotype A: Red and Brown (counted as checkered red)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: Red and Checkered (counted as checkered brown)\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: Plain and Brown (counted as plain red)\n4. Neither C nor B present \u2192 Phenotype D: Plain and Checkered (counted as plain brown)\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16\n- Phenotype B: 3/16\n- Phenotype C: 3/16\n- Phenotype D: 1/16\n\nThus, in terms of counts, if we have 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\n- 9 checkered red\n- 3 checkered brown\n- 3 plain red\n- 1 plain brown\n\nLooking at the options, option E is 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse order. However, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio, not necessarily the order. So depending on the order, option E is the inverse of our count. But the options may not specify order, but in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Among the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which is the correct ratio. So the correct answer should reflect this without reversing. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9 checkered red : 3 checkered brown : 3 plain red : 1 plain brown, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear.

Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes.

Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene.

The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16, but the fractions would be 6/16=3/8, 2/16=1/8, etc. But in our case, the fraction is 9/16 for A, 3/16 for B, etc. None of the options exactly match this. Let me look again at the options:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 6, Plain brown 2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. Checkered red 8, Checkered brown 4, Plain red 0, Plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, Plain red 1, Plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nHmm, all options sum to 16. Our analysis shows that the correct counts should be 9,3,3,1 for the four phenotypes. But looking at the options, none directly match this. Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio. From what I calculated, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C: Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 3, Plain brown 1. Because 9+3+3+1=16, matching the counts. Option C matches our calculation perfectly. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16. B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16. C.9,3,3,1\u2192sum16. D.1,3,9,3\u2192sum16. E.3,9,1,3\u2192sum16. All options sum to 16. So which one is correct? According to our calculation, the distribution should be 9:3:3:1, meaning Phenotype A is 9 parts, B is 3, C is 3, D is 1. Looking at the options, option C states 9,3,3,1. So the correct answer should reflect this. But looking back at the initial question, the user included an initial setup where the F2 was shown with certain counts, but now they want us to derive the correct phenotypic ratio. Based on our analysis, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

But looking at the options, each describes the order of phenotypes. Option C lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which corresponds to our probabilities: checkered red (phenotype D) is 1 part, plain red (A) is 9 parts, checkered brown (B) is 3 parts, plain brown (C) is 3 parts. Wait, but according to our earlier breakdown, checkered red is phenotype D, which is 1 part, plain red is phenotype A, which is 9 parts. Checkered brown is phenotype B, 3 parts, plain brown is phenotype C, 3 parts. So the order in option C is checkered red (D) 9, checkered brown (B) 3, plain red (A) 3, plain brown (C) 1. But according to our probabilities, checkered red is 1, plain red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain brown is 3. So option C has checkered red as 9, which is incorrect. Option E has checkered red as 3, which is also incorrect. Option A has checkered red as 6, which is wrong. Option B has checkered red as 8, which is also wrong. Only option C has the correct sequence of phenotypes in terms of their order, but the counts are swapped. Wait, no, option C has checkered red as 9, which should be 1. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, going back: the probabilities for each phenotype were:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16 (red and brown)\n- Phenotype B: 3/16 (red and checkered)\n- Phenotype C: 3/16 (plain and brown)\n- Phenotype D: 1/16 (plain and checkered)\n\nThus, the counts would be approximately 9,3,3,1 for a population size of 16. So option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our breakdown, checkered red is phenotype D (plain and checkered), which is 1/16, equivalent to 1 in a population of 16. Therefore, the correct count for checkered red would be 1, not 9. This suggests that none of the options perfectly align with our calculation unless we're scaling incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- checkered (c) and brown (B): Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n- checkered (c) and brown (B): Phenotype D\n- checkered (c) and brown (B): Phenotype D\n- checkered (c) and brown (b): Phenotype D\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- C present \u2192 red\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- C present and B present \u2192 red and brown\n- C present and B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n- C absent and B present \u2192 plain and brown\n- C absent and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C and B present)\n2. Red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and Brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain and Checkered (C and B absent)\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n- Red and Brown: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Red and Checkered: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Checkered: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, in a population of 16, we'd expect:\n\n- Red and Brown: 9\n- Red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain and Brown: 3\n- Plain and Checkered: 1\n\nLooking back at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our breakdown, checkered red is the plain and checkered (Phenotype D), which is 1. However, the options list \"checkered red\" as the first phenotype, which would correspond to the plain and checkered (Phenotype D) as 1. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the options are mislabeled, or I've misunderstood the terminology.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the recessive phenotype, which is plain, while \"plain\" refers to the dominant phenotype. If that's the case, then:\n\n- Plain (c) and Brown (B): Phenotype D\n- Plain (c) and Brown (b): Phenotype D\n- Plain (c) and brown (b): Phenotype D\n- Plain (c) and plain (cc) and brown (bb): Phenotype D\n\nWait, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" is used interchangeably with \"plain,\" and \"recessive\" is \"dominant.\" Perhaps the options are using different terminology. Alternatively, maybe the answer intended is option C, despite the labels, because the counts add up correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation's probabilities are different.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try a different approach. For each gene, the frequency of each allele is:\n\nFor C:\n\n- Frequency of C: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds have at least one C allele)\n- Frequency of c: 1/4\n\nFor B:\n\n- Frequency of B: 3/4\n- Frequency of b: 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each trait is the product of the individual probabilities. So, for the phenotype where both C and B are present:\n\nP(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Only C present (no B): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Only B present (no C): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Neither present: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThis confirms our previous calculation. Therefore, the correct distribution is:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): 9\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): 3\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): 3\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): 1\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nIf \"checkered\" is the dominant phenotype (which is actually the recessive), then:\n\n- checkered red would be the 9 (which is the dominant phenotype, Red)\n- checkered brown would be the 3 (which is the recessive phenotype, plain)\n- plain red would be the 3 (which is the dominant phenotype, Red)\n- plain brown would be the 1 (which is the recessive phenotype, plain)\n\nBut according to our analysis, checkered red is the dominant phenotype, which is 9. However, in the options, \"checkered red\" refers to the recessive phenotype (plain), which is 1. So perhaps the options have a labeling issue, but the counts do add up correctly. Therefore, among the options, option C is the only one that assigns the correct counts, even though the labels are swapped.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options sum to 16, which matches our calculations. But looking at the options, each describes the order of phenotypes. Option C lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Which corresponds to our probabilities: checkered red (phenotype D) is 1 part, plain red (A) is 9 parts, checkered brown (B) is 3 parts, plain brown (C) is 3 parts. Wait, but according to our earlier breakdown, checkered red is phenotype D, which is 1 part, plain red is phenotype A, which is 9 parts. Checkered brown is phenotype B, 3 parts, plain brown is phenotype C, 3 parts. So the order in option C is checkered red (D) 9, checkered brown (B) 3, plain red (A) 3, plain brown (C) 1. But according to our probabilities, checkered red is 1, plain red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain brown is 3. So option C has checkered red as 9, which is incorrect. Option E has checkered red as 3, which is also incorrect. Option A has checkered red as 6, which is wrong. Option B has checkered red as 8, which is also wrong. Only option C has the correct sequence of phenotypes in terms of their order, but the counts are swapped. Wait, no, option C has checkered red as 9, which should be 1. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, going back: the probabilities for each phenotype were:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9/16 (red and brown)\n- Phenotype B: 3/16 (red and checkered)\n- Phenotype C: 3/16 (plain and brown)\n- Phenotype D: 1/16 (plain and checkered)\n\nThus, the counts would be approximately 9,3,3,1 for a population size of 16. So option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our breakdown, checkered red is phenotype D (plain and checkered), which is 1/16, equivalent to 1 in a population of 16. Therefore, the correct count for checkered red would be 1, not 9. This suggests that none of the options perfectly align with our calculation unless we're scaling incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- checkered (c) and brown (B): Phenotype D (plain and checkered)\n- checkered (c) and brown (B): Phenotype D\n- checkered (c) and brown (B): Phenotype D\n- checkered (c) and brown (b): Phenotype D\nWait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So:\n\n- C present \u2192 red\n- B present \u2192 brown\n- C present and B present \u2192 red and brown\n- C present and B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n- C absent and B present \u2192 plain and brown\n- C absent and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C and B present)\n2. Red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and Brown (C absent, B present)\n4. Plain and Checkered (C and B absent)\n\nThe probabilities for each are:\n\n- Red and Brown: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Red and Checkered: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Checkered: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, in a population of 16, we'd expect:\n\n- Red and Brown: 9\n- Red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain and Brown: 3\n- Plain and Checkered: 1\n\nLooking back at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. But according to our breakdown, checkered red is the plain and checkered (Phenotype D), which is 1. However, the options list \"checkered red\" as the first phenotype, which would correspond to the plain and checkered (Phenotype D) as 1. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the options are mislabeled, or I've misunderstood the terminology.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the recessive phenotype, which is plain, while \"plain\" refers to the dominant phenotype. If that's the case, then:\n\n- Plain (c) and Brown (B): Phenotype D\n- Plain (c) and Brown (b): Phenotype D\n- Plain (c) and brown (b): Phenotype D\n- Plain (c) and plain (cc) and brown (bb): Phenotype D\n\nWait, that's confusing.

Therefore, the correct distribution is:\n\n- Phenotype A (Red and Brown): 9\n- Phenotype B (Red and Checkered): 3\n- Phenotype C (Plain and Brown): 3\n- Phenotype D (Plain and Checkered): 1\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nIf \"checkered\" is the dominant phenotype (which is actually the recessive), then:\n\n- checkered red would be the 9 (which is the dominant phenotype, Red)\n- checkered brown would be the 3 (which is the recessive phenotype, plain)\n- plain red would be the 3 (which is the dominant phenotype, Red)\n- plain brown would be the 1 (which is the recessive phenotype, plain)\n\nBut according to our analysis, checkered red is the dominant phenotype, which is 9.

The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Now, according to our calculations, the expected counts should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. But looking back, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so the order matters. The options list the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our analysis, the phenotypes are ordered as: checkered red (C and B present), checkered brown (C and b), plain red (c and B), plain brown (c and b). So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, matching option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.",
    "rollout": "\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking at the options, option C states: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Hmm, that seems conflicting because according to our analysis, the checkered phenotype (plain) would have 3 parts, but option C lists checkered red as 9, which contradicts. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait a minute, I think I confused the checkered phenotype with the plain. The checkered phenotype is when both alleles are recessive (cc and bb), resulting in a checkered pattern. The plain phenotype is when both alleles are recessive (cc and cc), resulting in a plain color. So the checkered phenotype would correspond to phenotype C (plain) and the plain phenotype would be phenotype D (neither).\n\nWait, no, wait. In our previous breakdown:\n\n- Phenotype A: both traits present \u2192 red and brown (phenotype 1)\n- Phenotype B: only C present \u2192 red and checkered (phenotype 2)\n- Phenotype C: only B present \u2192 plain and brown (phenotype 3)\n- Phenotype D: neither trait present \u2192 plain and checkered (phenotype 4)\n\nSo the checkered phenotype (phenotype 4) is plain and checkered, and the plain phenotype (phenotype 4) is also plain and checkered. Wait, no\u2014that's the same phenotype. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, hold on. The phenotypic ratios were computed as follows: Checkered red (A) 9, checkered brown (B) 3, plain red (C) 3, plain brown (D) 1. But according to the calculations, the plain phenotype (both traits missing) is 1 part, while the checkered phenotype (only one trait missing) is 3 parts. This suggests that the checkered phenotype is when one trait is present and the other is not. Wait, but in reality, the checkered pattern is when both traits are missing. Because the checkered pattern is a result of both genes being recessive. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant allele for body color, it will have both traits. If it lacks one dominant allele, it won't have that trait. Therefore, the checkered phenotype refers to the bird having both traits missing, i.e., cc and bb. Whereas the plain phenotype refers to both traits missing, but in this context, it's ambiguous. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the definitions. Let me re-express the phenotypes clearly:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): both traits expressed.\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): pigment red, no brown.\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): no pigment, but brown.\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): both traits missing.\n\nTherefore, the checkered phenotype is when both traits are absent (plain and checkered), and the plain phenotype is when both traits are absent (also plain and checkered). Wait, that can't be right because the plain phenotype would imply both traits are absent, making it identical to the checkered phenotype. That doesn't seem possible. Perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the terms. Alternatively, perhaps the terminology used in the question is different. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question defines:\n- Red: dominant pigment allele\n- Brown: dominant color allele\n- Checkered: recessive pigment allele\n- Plain: recessive color allele\n\nThus, a bird with both dominant alleles (C and B) will have both traits: red and brown.\nA bird with dominant pigment (C) and recessive color (b) will have red and checkered.\nA bird with recessive pigment (c) and dominant color (B) will have plain and brown.\nA bird with recessive pigment (c) and recessive color (b) will have plain and checkered.\n\nIn this case, the checkered phenotype refers to having both recessive alleles, resulting in a plain color and a checkered pattern. The plain phenotype refers to having both recessive traits, resulting in plain color but a checkered pattern. Wait, that still confuses the terms. Alternatively, perhaps the term 'checkered' is used to describe the overall pattern, implying that both traits are expressed. In that case, the checkered phenotype would mean both traits are present, and the plain phenotype would mean both traits are missing. Wait, but that's what I thought earlier. So perhaps the correct classification is:\n\n- Checkered red: both traits present (C and B)\n- Checkered brown: pigment red, no brown (C and b)\n- Plain red: no pigment, brown (c and B)\n- Plain brown: no pigment, no brown (c and b)\n\nIf that's the case, then the checkered phenotype (which is both traits present) would occur in 9 parts, and the plain phenotype (both traits missing) would occur in 1 part. However, the options given don't include such a split. Instead, the options suggest that the plain phenotype includes both checkered and brown. That suggests that the terminology may differ, possibly using 'plain' to refer to the absence of one trait regardless of the other. Alternatively, perhaps 'checkered' refers to the overall pattern, but the terminology is confusing.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me try another approach. According to standard Mendelian genetics, the possible phenotypic ratios for a dihybrid cross (two independent traits) with both traits expressed are typically 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Phenotype A (both traits present)\n- 3: Phenotype B (only first trait present)\n- 3: Phenotype C (only second trait present)\n- 1: Phenotype D (none of the traits present)\n\nIn our case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Both traits present: 9\n- Only pigment red: 3\n- Only color brown: 3\n- Neither trait present: 1\n\nWhich matches option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but in the options, the labels are Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown. So that would align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, where:\n\n- 9: Both traits present (Checkered red and brown)\n- 3: Pigment red only\n- 3: Color brown only\n- 1: Neither trait present (plain red and brown)\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of both traits is what causes the checkered pattern, so perhaps the checkered phenotype refers to having both traits present. Therefore, the ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1. Hence, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking at the options, option C states: \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Hmm, that seems conflicting because according to our analysis, the checkered phenotype (plain) would have 3 parts, but option C lists checkered red as 9, which contradicts. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypes.\n\nWait a minute, I think I confused the checkered phenotype with the plain. The checkered phenotype is when both alleles are recessive (cc and bb), resulting in a checkered pattern. The plain phenotype is when both alleles are recessive (cc and cc), resulting in a plain color. So the checkered phenotype would correspond to phenotype C (plain) and the plain phenotype would be phenotype D (neither).\n\nWait, no, wait. In our previous breakdown:\n\n- Phenotype A: both traits present \u2192 red and brown (phenotype 1)\n- Phenotype B: only C present \u2192 red and checkered (phenotype 2)\n- Phenotype C: only B present \u2192 plain and brown (phenotype 3)\n- Phenotype D: neither trait present \u2192 plain and checkered (phenotype 4)\n\nSo the checkered phenotype (phenotype 4) is plain and checkered, and the plain phenotype (phenotype 4) is also plain and checkered. Wait, no\u2014that's the same phenotype. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, hold on. The phenotypic ratios were computed as follows: Checkered red (A) 9, checkered brown (B) 3, plain red (C) 3, plain brown (D) 1. But according to the calculations, the plain phenotype (both traits missing) is 1 part, while the checkered phenotype (only one trait missing) is 3 parts. This suggests that the checkered phenotype is when one trait is present and the other is not. Wait, but in reality, the checkered pattern is when both traits are missing. Because the checkered pattern is a result of both genes being recessive. So if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment and at least one dominant allele for body color, it will have both traits. If it lacks one dominant allele, it won't have that trait. Therefore, the checkered phenotype refers to the bird having both traits missing, i.e., cc and bb. Whereas the plain phenotype refers to both traits missing, but in this context, it's ambiguous. Wait, perhaps I misapplied the definitions. Let me re-express the phenotypes clearly:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): both traits expressed.\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): pigment red, no brown.\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): no pigment, but brown.\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): both traits missing.\n\nTherefore, the checkered phenotype is when both traits are absent (plain and checkered), and the plain phenotype is when both traits are absent (also plain and checkered). Wait, that can't be right because the plain phenotype would imply both traits are absent, making it identical to the checkered phenotype. That doesn't seem possible. Perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the terms. Alternatively, perhaps the terminology used in the question is different. Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question defines:\n- Red: dominant pigment allele\n- Brown: dominant color allele\n- Checkered: recessive pigment allele\n- Plain: recessive color allele\n\nThus, a bird with both dominant alleles (C and B) will have both traits: red and brown.\nA bird with dominant pigment (C) and recessive color (b) will have red and checkered.\nA bird with recessive pigment (c) and dominant color (B) will have plain and brown.\nA bird with recessive pigment (c) and recessive color (b) will have plain and checkered.\n\nIn this case, the checkered phenotype refers to having both recessive alleles, resulting in a plain color and a checkered pattern. The plain phenotype refers to having both recessive traits, resulting in plain color but a checkered pattern. Wait, that still confuses the terms. Alternatively, perhaps the term 'checkered' is used to describe the overall pattern, implying that both traits are expressed. In that case, the checkered phenotype would mean both traits are present, and the plain phenotype would mean both traits are missing. Wait, but that's what I thought earlier. So perhaps the correct classification is:\n\n- Checkered red: both traits present (C and B)\n- Checkered brown: pigment red, no brown (C and b)\n- Plain red: no pigment, brown (c and B)\n- Plain brown: no pigment, no brown (c and b)\n\nIf that's the case, then the checkered phenotype (which is both traits present) would occur in 9 parts, and the plain phenotype (both traits missing) would occur in 1 part. However, the options given don't include such a split. Instead, the options suggest that the plain phenotype includes both checkered and brown. That suggests that the terminology may differ, possibly using 'plain' to refer to the absence of one trait regardless of the other. Alternatively, perhaps 'checkered' refers to the overall pattern, but the terminology is confusing.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me try another approach. According to standard Mendelian genetics, the possible phenotypic ratios for a dihybrid cross (two independent traits) with both traits expressed are typically 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Phenotype A (both traits present)\n- 3: Phenotype B (only first trait present)\n- 3: Phenotype C (only second trait present)\n- 1: Phenotype D (none of the traits present)\n\nIn our case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Both traits present: 9\n- Only pigment red: 3\n- Only color brown: 3\n- Neither trait present: 1\n\nWhich matches option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but in the options, the labels are Checkered red, Checkered brown, Plain red, Plain brown. So that would align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio, where:\n\n- 9: Both traits present (Checkered red and brown)\n- 3: Pigment red only\n- 3: Color brown only\n- 1: Neither trait present (plain red and brown)\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of both traits is what causes the checkered pattern, so perhaps the checkered phenotype refers to having both traits present. Therefore, the ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1. Hence, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB.8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options sum to 16, but the actual distribution varies. According to our calculations, the expected ratios should be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back, the options may not be labeled correctly. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That would imply a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which aligns with our calculations. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options sum to 16. But according to our calculations, the distribution should be 9:3:3:1, i.e., Phenotype A (9), B (3), C (3), D (1). Looking at the options, option C has 9,3,3,1, which aligns exactly with what we expect. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo each option represents the count for each phenotype. Therefore, the correct answer should be C, which states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.

The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

So the distribution is 9:3:3:1, which is the classic Mendelian ratio for two independently assorting genes. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our analysis, checkered is when both C and b are present, i.e., cc, so in terms of the phenotypes, checkered refers to the recessive phenotype, while plain is the dominant. Wait, hold on. Wait, the checkered bird is defined as having the recessive alleles for both genes, i.e., cc BB, which would mean that it's plain color (since c is recessive for pigment), but also, in terms of coat color, since B is dominant, it would be brown. Wait, no\u2014the bird's coat color is determined by B, not by the other gene. So, if a bird has b for both genes, it's plain. If it has B for at least one gene, it's brown. Wait, no\u2014wait, no, the coat color is determined by B, regardless of the other gene. So a bird with bb is plain, regardless of the pigment. So, the checkered bird in this context is actually the recessive phenotype (plain) because it's homozygous recessive for both genes. Wait, no\u2014the term \"checkered\" is used for the recessive phenotype, which is plain. Whereas the dominant phenotype is brown. So, the checkered birds refer to the plain ones, and the others are brown. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered (plain): 9 + 3 = 12 (because checkered is when both genes are recessive)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (only B present)\n- Plain brown: 9 (only C present)\n- Plain red: 3 (only C present? Wait, no\u2014all red birds have at least one C, so they are red. Wait, but red is determined by C. So, in the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the checkered brown is when B is present but C is absent, which is 3. Plain brown is when B is present and C is absent, which is 9. Plain red is when both C and B are present, which is 9? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: checkered (plain)\n- 3: checkered brown (only B present)\n- 3: plain brown (only C present)\n- 1: plain red (both C and B present)\n\nWait, but according to the standard ratio, it's 9:3:3:1, where 9 represents the homozygous recessive (checkered), 3 the heterozygous dominant (checkered brown?), 3 the heterozygous recessive (plain brown), and 1 the homozygous dominant (plain red). Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are swapped. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the recessive phenotype, which is plain, and \"plain\" refers to the dominant phenotype, which is brown. So in that case:\n\n- Checkered (plain): 9 (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (heterozygous for B, homozygous recessive for C)\n- Plain brown: 3 (homozygous recessive for B, heterozygous for C)\n- Brown (dominant): 1 (homozygous dominant for B)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me get this straight. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A (most common)\n2. C_ and bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. cc and B_ \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. cc and bb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype A (both traits present):\n\n- Probability of C_: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the population has at least one C allele)\n- Probability of B_: 3/4 (similarly)\nSince the presence of C and B are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\nPhenotype B (only C present, B absent):\n\n- Probability of C_: 3/4\n- Probability of B_: 1/4 (since only B present means bb)\nCombined probability: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype C (only B present, C absent):\n\n- Probability of C_: 1/4\n- Probability of B_: 3/4\nCombined probability: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype D (neither trait present):\n\n- Probability of C_: 1/4\n- Probability of B_: 1/4\nCombined probability: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into counts (assuming a large number of offspring, say 16), we'd expect:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nBut in the answer choices, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum16\nSo all options add up to 16, which corresponds to the 9+3+3+1=16. So the distribution is 9:3:3:1, which is the classic Mendelian ratio for two independently assorting genes. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, looking at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but according to our analysis, checkered is when both C and b are present, i.e., cc, so in terms of the phenotypes, checkered refers to the recessive phenotype, while plain is the dominant. Wait, hold on. Wait, the checkered bird is defined as having the recessive alleles for both genes, i.e., cc BB, which would mean that it's plain color (since c is recessive for pigment), but also, in terms of coat color, since B is dominant, it would be brown. Wait, no\u2014the bird's coat color is determined by B, not by the other gene. So, if a bird has b for both genes, it's plain. If it has B for at least one gene, it's brown. Wait, no\u2014wait, no, the coat color is determined by B, regardless of the other gene. So a bird with bb is plain, regardless of the pigment. So, the checkered bird in this context is actually the recessive phenotype (plain) because it's homozygous recessive for both genes. Wait, no\u2014the term \"checkered\" is used for the recessive phenotype, which is plain. Whereas the dominant phenotype is brown. So, the checkered birds refer to the plain ones, and the others are brown. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered (plain): 9 + 3 = 12 (because checkered is when both genes are recessive)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (only B present)\n- Plain brown: 9 (only C present)\n- Plain red: 3 (only C present? Wait, no\u2014all red birds have at least one C, so they are red. Wait, but red is determined by C. So, in the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the checkered brown is when B is present but C is absent, which is 3. Plain brown is when B is present and C is absent, which is 9. Plain red is when both C and B are present, which is 9? Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: checkered (plain)\n- 3: checkered brown (only B present)\n- 3: plain brown (only C present)\n- 1: plain red (both C and B present)\n\nWait, but according to the standard ratio, it's 9:3:3:1, where 9 represents the homozygous recessive (checkered), 3 the heterozygous dominant (checkered brown?), 3 the heterozygous recessive (plain brown), and 1 the homozygous dominant (plain red). Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the terms are swapped. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the recessive phenotype, which is plain, and \"plain\" refers to the dominant phenotype, which is brown. So in that case:\n\n- Checkered (plain): 9 (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (heterozygous for B, homozygous recessive for C)\n- Plain brown: 3 (homozygous recessive for B, heterozygous for C)\n- Brown (dominant): 1 (homozygous dominant for B)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me get this straight. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (C_), the bird is red.\n- If B is present (B_), the bird is brown.\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_ and B_: red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A (most common)\n2. C_ and bb \u2192 red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. cc and B_ \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. cc and bb \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe probabilities for each phenotype are calculated as follows:\n\nFor Phenotype A (both traits present):\n\n- Probability of C_: 3/4 (since 3/4 of the population has at least one C allele)\n- Probability of B_: 3/4 (similarly)\nSince the presence of C and B are independent, the combined probability is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\nPhenotype B (only C present, B absent):\n\n- Probability of C_: 3/4\n- Probability of B_: 1/4 (since only B present means bb)\nCombined probability: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype C (only B present, C absent):\n\n- Probability of C_: 1/4\n- Probability of B_: 3/4\nCombined probability: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nPhenotype D (neither trait present):\n\n- Probability of C_: 1/4\n- Probability of B_: 1/4\nCombined probability: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into counts (assuming a large number of offspring, say 16), we'd expect:\n\n- Phenotype A: 9\n- Phenotype B: 3\n- Phenotype C: 3\n- Phenotype D: 1\n\nBut in the answer choices, option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no\u2014the terminology is confusing. According to our analysis:\n\n- Checkered (plain) is Phenotype D: 1\n- Checkered brown (only B) is Phenotype B: 3\n- Plain brown (only C) is Phenotype C: 3\n- Brown (dominant) is Phenotype A: 9\n\nBut none of the answer options exactly match this.

So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "B.8,4,0,4\u2192sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16\nSo all options add up to 16.",

But looking at the ratios, each option represents the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total. For example, Option A: Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sum 16. So the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Hmm, that suggests that none of the options exactly match our expected ratio. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, hold on. Homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents are:\n\nParent 1: Checkered red \u2192 Genotype cc BB (since checkered is recessive, red is dominant)\nParent 2: Plain brown \u2192 Genotype cc bb (since plain is recessive, brown is dominant)\n\nAh! That changes things. Earlier, I thought Parent 1 was CC BB and Parent 2 was cc bb, but actually, it's the opposite. So Parent 1 is cc BB (checkered red), and Parent 2 is cc bb (plain brown). Now, let's redo the Punnett square with this new information.\n\nSo Parent 1: cc BB (can only produce gametes with c and B)\nParent 2: cc bb (can only produce gametes with c and b)\n\nWhen these two parents mate, the F1 generation will receive c from each parent for the non-recessive allele and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2. So the F1 will all be c c B b \u2192 genotype ccBb.\n\nThen, the F1 (ccBb) selfs to produce F2. Now, the F2 genotypes will follow Mendelian ratios for each gene. Each gene is independently inherited, so the possible F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor the coat color (B/B): \n- 25% BB (all brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nFor the pigment color (C/C): \n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cb (red)\n- 25% cb (plain)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are determined by the combination of these probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. Now, the F2 phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Both coat and pigment dominant (C and B): Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n2. Coating dominant (C), Pigment recessive (c): Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered\n3. Coating recessive (b), Pigment dominant (C): Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown\n4. Both coat and pigment recessive (b and c): Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype, we can use the multiplication principle for independent traits.\n\nPhenotype 1 (C and B): Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype 2 (C, b): Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 3 (b, C): Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 4 (b, b): Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which correspond to the options listed above. Now, looking at the answer choices, option C is 9,3,3,1, which matches our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation.

Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

But looking at the ratios, each option represents the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total. For example, Option A: Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 sum 16. So the ratio is 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1. But according to our calculations, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Hmm, that suggests that none of the options exactly match our expected ratio. Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read the problem again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, hold on. Homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the parents are:\n\nParent 1: Checkered red \u2192 Genotype cc BB (since checkered is recessive, red is dominant)\nParent 2: Plain brown \u2192 Genotype cc bb (since plain is recessive, brown is dominant)\n\nAh! That changes things. Earlier, I thought Parent 1 was CC BB and Parent 2 was cc bb, but actually, it's the opposite. So Parent 1 is cc BB (checkered red), and Parent 2 is cc bb (plain brown).

So the F1 will all be c c B b \u2192 genotype ccBb.\n\nThen, the F1 (ccBb) selfs to produce F2. Now, the F2 genotypes will follow Mendelian ratios for each gene. Each gene is independently inherited, so the possible F2 genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor the coat color (B/B): \n- 25% BB (all brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered)\n\nFor the pigment color (C/C): \n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cb (red)\n- 25% cb (plain)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are determined by the combination of these probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. Now, the F2 phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. Both coat and pigment dominant (C and B): Phenotype 1: Red and Brown\n2. Coating dominant (C), Pigment recessive (c): Phenotype 2: Red and Checkered\n3. Coating recessive (b), Pigment dominant (C): Phenotype 3: Plain and Brown\n4. Both coat and pigment recessive (b and c): Phenotype 4: Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, to find the frequency of each phenotype, we can use the multiplication principle for independent traits.\n\nPhenotype 1 (C and B): Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nPhenotype 2 (C, b): Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 3 (b, C): Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\nPhenotype 4 (b, b): Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nThus, the ratios are 9:3:3:1, which correspond to the options listed above.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",
    "chunk_resampled": "B. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.",
    "rollout": "\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo the correct ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option C. However, looking back at the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which matches our calculation. But wait, let me double-check. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. The probabilities are:\n\nPhenotype A: Both C and B \u2192 9/16 of the population\nPhenotype B: Only C \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype C: Only B \u2192 3/16\nPhenotype D: Neither \u2192 1/16\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16",

Looking at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\n\nYes, that matches our calculation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1.

Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16; B.8,4,0,4\u2192sum 16; C.9,3,3,1\u2192sum 16; D.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16; E.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16; F.4,4,4,4\u2192sum 16; G.12,2,2,0\u2192sum 16; H.5,3,2,6\u2192sum 16; I.7,5,1,3\u2192sum 16.\n\nSo all options sum to 16. But the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio, so looking for the ratio of Phenotype A : B : C : D. From our calculations, it's 9:3:3:1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options:\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9:3:3:1\n\nYes, that matches our calculation.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192 sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192 sum 16\nSo all options represent the ratio 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 parts for both traits, 3 for each alone, and 1 for neither. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option C states the ratio as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that matches exactly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different.

Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nSo all options add up to 16, but the question asks for the ratio. Option C has 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown, totaling 16. This corresponds exactly to our calculations. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

But looking back, our calculations suggest that the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options don't list this exactly.

Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC.9,3,3,1\u2192 sum 16\nD.1,3,9,3\u2192sum 16\nE.3,9,1,3\u2192sum 16\nSo all options sum to 16. But looking back, our calculations suggest that the ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options don't list this exactly. Option C is 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to Phenotype A:D:C:B, i.e., checkered red (A=9?), wait no\u2014the order is different. Wait, according to our classification:\n\n- Phenotype A: checkered red (C)\n- Phenotype B: checkered brown (D)\n- Phenotype C: plain red (A)\n- Phenotype D: plain brown (B)\n\nBut in the options, the letters seem to correspond differently. For example, option C lists Phenotype A as checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). That matches our earlier breakdown.\n\nWait, but in our analysis, the count is 9:3:3:1. But in the options, option C is 9,3,3,1, which aligns with that. However, let me double-check the initial assumption. Did I get the phenotypic ratios correctly?\n\nYes, because the number of birds with each phenotype is based on the probabilities: 9 (A), 3 (B), 3 (C), 1 (D). So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other. So for each bird, their phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present in a dominant form. So the possible phenotypic classes are: 1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16.

Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions.

Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nSo the correct answer would be option C: phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1. But looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at the choices, option C states the ratio as 9,3,3,1, which corresponds to the 9:3:3:1 ratio.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive) Alternatively, since the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective trait, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the proportion of each combination. Given that, each gene's inheritance is independent, so the probability of each phenotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Phenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and brown (B)\nProbability = P(C) * P(B) = 1 * 1 = 1 (since both genes are dominant)\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not additive like that. Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the probability that a bird has pigment red is 1 (since any C gives red), and brown is 1 (any B gives brown). So the probability of having both traits (red and brown) is 1*1=1, but that doesn't make sense because it implies certainty. That suggests that all birds in this scenario will express both traits, but that can't be right because some birds might not have one trait even if they have another. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. If both genes are dominant, the bird will have both traits. If either gene is recessive, the corresponding trait won't appear. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not accurate. Each bird has two separate traits: pigment color and body color. The presence of a dominant allele in each gene leads to the respective trait being expressed. So the phenotype is a combination where: - If C is present, the bird is red (regardless of B). - If B is present, the bird is brown (regardless of C). Thus, the phenotype can be: 1. Both C and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered Now, the probability of each phenotype is calculated by considering the independent assortment of the two genes. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's compute them: 1. Pigment red and brown (C and B):\n   - Probability of C: 1 (since any C gives red)\n   - Probability of B: 1 (since any B gives brown)\n   - Combined probability: 1 * 1 = 1\n   Wait, that's impossible because all birds must have at least one dominant allele for each trait, which isn't true. So I must have made a mistake here. Ah, no\u2014I see my mistake. Each bird has two traits, but each trait is determined by one gene. So the presence of a dominant allele in one gene affects that trait, and the same goes for the other gene. So the actual phenotypic expressions aren't additive but rather dependent on both genes. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider each bird's phenotype based on both genes. For example, a bird could be: - Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4 To find the probability of each phenotype, we need to determine how likely each combination is based on the parents' genotypes. The parents are: - Parent 1: CC BB (so C=c, B=b?)\nWait no\u2014Parent 1 is CC BB. Wait, C is dominant, so the alleles are CC. Similarly, B is dominant, so the alleles are BB. So Parent 1 is homozygous for both C and B. Parent 2: cc bb. So both parents are homozygous for the recessive alleles. When they mate, the F1 generation will be CcBb, because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2. In F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are: - C: C C, C c, c c\n- B: B B, B b, b b Each combination occurs with specific probabilities. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. We'll use a Punnett square to model this. The F1 is CcBb, so each parent can produce four gametes: - CB (probability 25%)\n- cb (probability 25%) Thus, the F2 will have combinations: 1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n2. CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n3. cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc \u00d7 Bb\n4. cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc \u00d7 bb Wait, no\u2014each parent can produce CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) But since each bird has two traits, we need to combine these into phenotypes. Alternatively, a better way is to construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation. Each gene is independently assorting, so the F2 will have: For the C locus:\n- 25% CC (red)\n- 50% Cc (pigeon)\n- 25% cc (plain) Similarly, for the B locus:\n- 25% BB (brown)\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 25% bb (checkered) But wait, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, regardless of the other.

Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.

Both C and B are present \u2192 Phenotype A: red and brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Phenotype B: red and checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Phenotype C: plain and brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Phenotype D: plain and checkered Now, we calculate the probabilities for each class. Class A: Both C and B are present. - Probability for C: 3/4 (since 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc \u2192 100% C, but wait no\u2014wait, the probability that a bird has C present is 3/4 (since 3/4 of the birds will have at least one C allele). Similarly, the probability that a bird has B present is 3/4. However, since the presence of C and B are independent events, the probability of both being present is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. Wait, but that's not quite right because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so the probability of a bird having both traits is 9/16, having only C (but not B) is 3/16, having only B (but not C) is 3/16, and neither is 1/16. Wait, let me think differently. For each bird, the probability of having C present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, the probability of having B present is 3/4, as any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. However, the presence of C and B are independent, so the probability of both traits appearing is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16. The probability of only C present (no B) is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16. The probability of only B present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16. And the probability of neither is (1/4)^2=1/16. Wait, but that seems off because the sum of these probabilities would be 9+3+3+1=16, which adds up to 1. So that makes sense. Now, translating these probabilities into the number of birds in each phenotype: - Phenotype A (both traits present): 9 parts\n- Phenotype B (only C): 3 parts\n- Phenotype C (only B): 3 parts\n- Phenotype D (neither): 1 part But since the total number of offspring is large, say N, then the counts would be approximately proportional to these fractions. Looking back at the options given, none directly match this except option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. Wait, but the options don't have 16 as a denominator. They have numbers like 1,3, etc. Maybe the scale factor is different. Wait, the options are: A. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum 16\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16\nSo all options add up to 16. But according to our calculations, the ratios should be 9:3:3:1. Which corresponds to option C. However, looking back, the options provided include option C as \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" But according to our analysis, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, and plain brown is 1. Yes, that aligns perfectly with option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",
