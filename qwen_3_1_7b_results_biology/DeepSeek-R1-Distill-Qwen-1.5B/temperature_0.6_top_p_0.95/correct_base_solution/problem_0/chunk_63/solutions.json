    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are four, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But wait, that's only true if all combinations are equally likely. However, our scenario might have different probabilities due to the specific dominance relationships. Let me consider the actual dominance hierarchy:\n\n- For pigment color (gene C):\n  - C > c (dominant > recessive)\n  \n- For body color (gene B):\n  - B > b (dominant > recessive)\n\nNow, let's list the possible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): All individuals with at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B will have this phenotype.\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Individuals with C (at least one dominant allele) and b (at least one recessive allele).\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): Individuals with c (recessive) and B (dominant).\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): Both alleles are recessive.\n\nNow, calculating the probability for each phenotype:\n\nFor Pigment red (C):\n\nProbability = 1 - probability of having two recessive alleles for C = 1 - (probability of c * probability of c) = 1 - (1/4 * 1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16\n\nBut within Pigment red, we also have Brown (B) and Checkered (b).\n\nWait, no, each phenotype combines two traits. So for each phenotype, the probability is the product of the probabilities for each trait. However, since the genes are independent, the overall probability is the multiplication of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype's probability:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n\nProbability = Probability(C) * Probability(B) = (1 - (1/4)^2) * (1 - (1/4)^2) = (15/16)*(15/16) = 225/256 \u2248 0.8789\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n\nProbability = [1 - (1/4)] * [(1/4) * (1 - (1/4))] = (3/4) * (3/4 * 3/4) = Wait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nActually, the probability of having at least one C (p pigment red) is 1 - (prob both c) = 1 - (1/4)^2 = 15/16.\n\nWithin Pigment red, the probability of having at least one B (Brown) is 1 - (prob both b) = 1 - (1/4)^2 = 15/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability of having at least one b (Checkered) is 15/16.\n\nWait, no. Within Pigment red, the presence of B doesn't affect the pigment red phenotype, except that Brown is a separate trait. So for Pigment red and Brown, the combined probability is:\n\nProbability(Pigment red) * Probability(Brown) = (15/16) * (15/16) = 225/256 \u2248 0.8789\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain (c) and Brown (B)\n\nProbability = Probability(c) * Probability(B) = (1/4) * (15/16) = 15/64 \u2248 0.2344\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain (c) and Checkered (b)\n\nProbability = Probability(c) * Probability(b) = (1/4) * (1/16) = 1/64 \u2248 0.0156\n\nAdding them up: 225/256 + 15/64 + 15/64 + 1/64 = Let's convert everything to 256 denominator:\n\n225/256 + (15*4)/256 + (15*4)/256 + 1/256 = 225 + 60 + 60 + 1 = 346/256 \u2248 1.348, which is greater than 1, which is impossible. Hmm, something must be wrong here. Because the sum of probabilities shouldn't exceed 1. Let me re-examine my calculations.\n\nAh, I see the mistake. When considering Pigment red and Brown, the events are mutually exclusive in terms of the two traits. Wait, no. Actually, Pigment red is dominant over plain, and Brown is dominant over checkered. So a bird could have both Pigment red and Brown without being checkered, or Pigment red and checkered, etc.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The Pigment red and Brown phenotype includes all cases where either pigment is red or brown, regardless of the body color. Similarly for Pigment red and Checkered. So perhaps the way I calculated the probabilities is incorrect.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Each bird has two independent genes. For each gene, there are three possible phenotypes: Pigment red, Pigment plain, Brown, Checkered. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s determined by the combination of the two genes.\n\nAlternatively, let's model each trait separately and then combine them. For pigment color (C):\n\n- Pigment red: C dominant \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Plain: cc \u2192 Phenotype B\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Brown: B dominant \u2192 Phenotype C\n- Checkered: bb \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nThe phenotypes are combinations of these. So the possible phenotypic combinations are AC, AD, BC, BD.\n\nEach has a certain probability:\n\nAC: Pigment red and Brown\nAD: Pigment red and Checkered\nBC: Plain and Brown\nBD: Plain and Checkered\n\nCalculating each:\n\nAC: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Probability = (1 - (1/4)^2) * (1 - (1/4)^2) = (15/16) * (15/16) = 225/256 \u2248 0.8789\n\nAD: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Probability = (15/16) * (1/16) = 15/256 \u2248 0.0586\n\nBC: c and B dominant \u2192 Probability = (1/16) * (15/16) = 15/256 \u2248 0.0586\n\nBD: c and b \u2192 Probability = (1/16) * (1/16) = 1/256 \u2248 0.0039\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\nAC: 225/256\nAD: 15/256\nBC: 15/256\nBD: 1/256\n\nTotal = (225 + 15 + 15 + 1)/256 = 256/256 = 1\n\nSo the probabilities are correct now.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into ratios:\n\nAC : AD : BC : BD = 225 : 15 : 15 : 1\n\nSimplifying:\n\nDivide each by 15:\n\n15 : 1 : 1 : (1/15)\n\nWait, that's awkward. Alternatively, factor out 15 from the first term:\n\n225/15 : 15/15 : 15/15 : 1/15 = 15 : 1 : 1 : (1/15)\n\nHmm, that seems messy. Maybe express all in terms of 1/15:\n\n225/15 = 15 parts\n15/15 = 1 part\n15/15 = 1 part\n1/15 remains\n\nSo the ratio becomes 15 : 1 : 1 : 1/15\n\nTo make it easier, multiply all by 15 to eliminate fractions:\n\n15 * 15 : 15 * 1 : 15 * 1 : 15 * (1/15) = 225 : 15 : 15 : 1\n\nWhich brings us back to the same numbers. Alternatively, perhaps expressing it as:\n\n(225/256) AC, (15/256) AD, (15/256) BC, (1/256) BD\n\nThus, the ratio of Phenotypic Ratio is 225 : 15 : 15 : 1, but simplified further.\n\nWe can divide each by 1:\n\n225 : 15 : 15 : 1\n\nThis simplifies to 15 : 1 : 1 : (1/15), but it's more straightforward to leave it as 225 : 15 : 15 : 1.\n\nHowever, looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that might not be accurate. Actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C, b)\n- Pigment plain and brown (c, B)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (c, b)\n\nBut wait, the actual combinations would be based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C (so either C or c), then it's red. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for B (B or b), then it's brown. So the phenotype depends on whether both C and B are present (red and brown), or any one is present (red or checkered), or neither is present (plain and checkered).\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, we can calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (red) = 1/2 (since C is dominant, and the bird must have at least one C)\n- Probability of c (plain) = 1/2\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B (brown) = 1/2\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 1/2\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n3. Pigment plain and brown: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sum is 4*(1/4)=1, which checks out. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. But that seems too simplistic because the F2 generation isn't necessarily showing all possible combinations equally unless each gene is segregating independently. Wait, but in reality, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross should follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, where each phenotype is equally likely because each gene segregates independently. But looking at the options, none seem to reflect a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial cross isn't F1 from a dihybrid cross. Let me re-examine the question. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So the F1 would be CcBb, right? Because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So the F1 would be heterozygous for both genes. Then, the F2 generation comes from F1 selfing. So the F2 would have four possible phenotypes, each with a 25% probability, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But looking at the answer choices, option D is 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16, whereas the others don't fit. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio after accounting for dominance and blending, but given that each gene's dominance is explicit, the phenotypes remain distinct based on the presence of dominant alleles. So each bird would display one specific phenotype based on the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match that exactly. Looking back at the options, option G says 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16, but that suggests a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the phenotypic ratio but something else, like the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the question is considering the ratio of the number of each phenotype, including the cases where a bird could express multiple traits, but according to the problem statement, each bird displays one phenotype based on both genes. So perhaps the options are misrepresented, or I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nLet me try to clarify the possible scenarios:\n\nEach bird can have one of four possible combinations based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nAssuming each of these has a 25% chance, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer options reflect this. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds to 16, suggesting perhaps some phenotypes are absent or merged. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 generation, without considering dominance probabilities, but rather counting all possible combinations regardless of dominance. In that case, each parent produces gametes in a certain proportion, and the F2 would have a certain count for each phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the expected phenotypic ratio but about the genotypic ratio, but the user specified \"phenotypic ratio.\" Alternatively, maybe I misread the question regarding the F2 generation. Let me re-express the question: the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed under the assumption that each bird has a 25% chance of each phenotype, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the answer options directly state this. The closest option is G, which is 12:2:2:0, adding up to 16, but that doesn't align with my calculation. Perhaps I'm miscalculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the F2 generation refers to the number of each type of bird, considering that some phenotypes may not occur due to genetic constraints. For example, if both genes are recessive, the bird wouldn't display any trait, but according to the problem statement, the plain bird is expressed even when both genes are recessive. So the plain bird is expressed regardless, same with the checkered. Therefore, all four phenotypes are possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look at the answer options more closely. Let me go through them one by one:\n\nOption A: 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Sum is 16. This would imply a 6:6:2:2 ratio, which simplifies to 3:3:1:1.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 2:1:0:1.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 9:3:3:1.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 1:3:9:3.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 3:9:1:3.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 1:1:1:1.\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 12:2:2:0.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 5:3:2:6.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 7:5:1:3.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12. Ratio is 2:6:3:1.\nOption K: 1,1,1,1 \u2192 Sum is 4. Ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which seems plausible if the F2 generation results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio but adjusted somehow. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't following a standard Mendelian ratio because the parents aren't pure. Let me reconsider the initial cross. The F1 is CcBb, and F2 is F1 selfed. So the F2 would have the following genotypic distribution:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nThe phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Pigment plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Pigment plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nIf each of these has a 25% chance, then the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options directly reflect this. Option G suggests a 12:2:2:0 ratio, which would mean Phenotype 1 appears 12 times, while Phenotypes 2, 3, and 4 appear twice each. That doesn't add up to 16, though. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the genotypic ratio instead of the phenotypic ratio. If so, the correct genotypic ratio would be 1:2:1:0 for each trait, but that's not what the question states.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the F2 generation isn't following a 9:3:3:1 ratio because the parents are not producing gametes in a way that reflects Mendel's laws perfectly. For instance, if the F1 (CcBb) is selfed, the F2 would have a 1:2:1:0 ratio for each trait, but this contradicts Mendelian expectations. Alternatively, if the parents are not properly crossed, but the question specifies the cross as F1 selfing, so that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the parents. The first parent is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the second is plain brown (cc bb). So their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be from selfing that. So the F2 would have a 1:2:1:0 ratio for each trait, which translates to 12:2:2:0 if considering all four phenotypes, but that doesn't make sense because each bird can only have one phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to include all possible phenotypes, leading to a 16-count scenario, but the options don't include such a ratio.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll revisit the original question to ensure I understood it correctly. The user asked for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, along with genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. Based on my analysis, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match this. Option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which might suggest that only the dominant phenotypes are considered, but that's inconsistent with the problem statement which mentions all four possible traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the number of each phenotype, treating some as dominant over others, but the problem doesn't specify dominance beyond the given alleles. Therefore, I might conclude that the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't among the options, I must consider another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options, and the correct answer is option G, which suggests a 12:2:2:0 ratio. However, this doesn't align with the expectation of a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Another possibility is that the user intended to ask about the genotypic ratio, but that's also not reflected in the options.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the discrepancy between my calculations and the provided options, the most logical choice based on the options available would be option G, which presents a 12:2:2:0 ratio. However, I'm aware that this doesn't strictly align with the expected Mendelian ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that might not be accurate. Actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C, b)\n- Pigment plain and brown (c, B)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (c, b)\n\nBut wait, the actual combinations would be based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for C (so either C or c), then it's red. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for B (B or b), then it's brown. So the phenotype depends on whether both C and B are present (red and brown), or any one is present (red or checkered), or neither is present (plain and checkered).\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability of each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, we can calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C (red) = 1/2 (since C is dominant, and the bird must have at least one C)\n- Probability of c (plain) = 1/2\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B (brown) = 1/2\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 1/2\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n3. Pigment plain and brown: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sum is 4*(1/4)=1, which checks out. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. But that seems too simplistic because the F2 generation isn't necessarily showing all possible combinations equally unless each gene is segregating independently. Wait, but in reality, the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross should follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, where each phenotype is equally likely because each gene segregates independently. But looking at the options, none seem to reflect a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial cross isn't F1 from a dihybrid cross. Let me re-examine the question. The cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) bird. So the F1 would be CcBb, right? Because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. So the F1 would be heterozygous for both genes. Then, the F2 generation comes from F1 selfing. So the F2 would have four possible phenotypes, each with a 25% probability, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But looking at the answer choices, option D is 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16, whereas the others don't fit. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio after accounting for dominance and blending, but given that each gene's dominance is explicit, the phenotypes remain distinct based on the presence of dominant alleles. So each bird would display one specific phenotype based on the presence of at least one dominant allele in each gene. Thus, the phenotypic ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match that exactly. Looking back at the options, option G says 12:2:2:0, which adds up to 16, but that suggests a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the phenotypic ratio but something else, like the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nWait, another possibility: maybe the question is considering the ratio of the number of each phenotype, including the cases where a bird could express multiple traits, but according to the problem statement, each bird displays one phenotype based on both genes. So perhaps the options are misrepresented, or I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nLet me try to clarify the possible scenarios:\n\nEach bird can have one of four possible combinations based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nAssuming each of these has a 25% chance, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the answer options reflect this. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which adds to 16, suggesting perhaps some phenotypes are absent or merged. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype in terms of the F2 generation, without considering dominance probabilities, but rather counting all possible combinations regardless of dominance. In that case, each parent produces gametes in a certain proportion, and the F2 would have a certain count for each phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the expected phenotypic ratio but about the genotypic ratio, but the user specified \"phenotypic ratio.\" Alternatively, maybe I misread the question regarding the F2 generation. Let me re-express the question: the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed under the assumption that each bird has a 25% chance of each phenotype, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. However, none of the answer options directly state this. The closest option is G, which is 12:2:2:0, adding up to 16, but that doesn't align with my calculation. Perhaps I'm miscalculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another angle: perhaps the F2 generation refers to the number of each type of bird, considering that some phenotypes may not occur due to genetic constraints. For example, if both genes are recessive, the bird wouldn't display any trait, but according to the problem statement, the plain bird is expressed even when both genes are recessive. So the plain bird is expressed regardless, same with the checkered. Therefore, all four phenotypes are possible.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look at the answer options more closely. Let me go through them one by one:\n\nOption A: 6,6,2,2 \u2192 Sum is 16. This would imply a 6:6:2:2 ratio, which simplifies to 3:3:1:1.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 2:1:0:1.\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 9:3:3:1.\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 1:3:9:3.\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 3:9:1:3.\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 1:1:1:1.\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 12:2:2:0.\nOption H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 5:3:2:6.\nOption I: 7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sum is 16. Ratio is 7:5:1:3.\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12. Ratio is 2:6:3:1.\nOption K: 1,1,1,1 \u2192 Sum is 4. Ratio is 1:1:1:1.\n\nLooking at the options, option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which seems plausible if the F2 generation results in a 9:3:3:1 ratio but adjusted somehow. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't following a standard Mendelian ratio because the parents aren't pure. Let me reconsider the initial cross. The F1 is CcBb, and F2 is F1 selfed. So the F2 would have the following genotypic distribution:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nThe phenotypic distribution would be:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc: Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc: Pigment plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb: Pigment plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nIf each of these has a 25% chance, then the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, none of the options directly reflect this. Option G suggests a 12:2:2:0 ratio, which would mean Phenotype 1 appears 12 times, while Phenotypes 2, 3, and 4 appear twice each. That doesn't add up to 16, though. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the genotypic ratio instead of the phenotypic ratio. If so, the correct genotypic ratio would be 1:2:1:0 for each trait, but that's not what the question states.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the F2 generation isn't following a 9:3:3:1 ratio because the parents are not producing gametes in a way that reflects Mendel's laws perfectly. For instance, if the F1 (CcBb) is selfed, the F2 would have a 1:2:1:0 ratio for each trait, but this contradicts Mendelian expectations. Alternatively, if the parents are not properly crossed, but the question specifies the cross as F1 selfing, so that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in specifying the parents. The first parent is homozygous checkered red (CC BB), and the second is plain brown (cc bb). So their F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be from selfing that. So the F2 would have a 1:2:1:0 ratio for each trait, which translates to 12:2:2:0 if considering all four phenotypes, but that doesn't make sense because each bird can only have one phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps the user meant to include all possible phenotypes, leading to a 16-count scenario, but the options don't include such a ratio.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll revisit the original question to ensure I understood it correctly. The user asked for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, along with genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios. Based on my analysis, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match this. Option G has a ratio of 12:2:2:0, which might suggest that only the dominant phenotypes are considered, but that's inconsistent with the problem statement which mentions all four possible traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to refer to the number of each phenotype, treating some as dominant over others, but the problem doesn't specify dominance beyond the given alleles. Therefore, I might conclude that the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't among the options, I must consider another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options, and the correct answer is option G, which suggests a 12:2:2:0 ratio. However, this doesn't align with the expectation of a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Another possibility is that the user intended to ask about the genotypic ratio, but that's also not reflected in the options.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the discrepancy between my calculations and the provided options, the most logical choice based on the options available would be option G, which presents a 12:2:2:0 ratio. However, I'm aware that this doesn't strictly align with the expected Mendelian ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype based on the probabilities of the gene combinations.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H list different phenotypic ratios. Let's see what makes sense. The F2 generation is derived from F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. So the F2 genotypes will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but since we're dealing with two traits, each contributing two letters, it becomes a 3x3 grid. However, since both traits are under complete dominance, each bird will express the dominant trait if any allele is dominant. So for pigment color (C/B), if either C or c is present, it's red. If both are c, it's plain. Similarly, for body color (B/b), if either B or b is present, it's brown. If both are b, it's checkered.\n\nWait, but in the cross described, the parents are homozygous for both genes. So in the F2, the possible phenotypes are determined by the segregation of these genes. For the C locus: in F1, all are C, so in F2, 25% CC (C), 50% Cc (C), and 25% cc (c). Similarly for the B locus: 25% BB (B), 50% Bb (B), and 25% bb (b). Since these genes assort independently, the combined phenotypes will be all possible combinations of C/B and c/b.\n\nBut wait, the given options don't include a 3x3 grid, but rather specific counts like 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. That suggests that the question might be focusing only on one trait, perhaps ignoring the other. Alternatively, maybe the options are simplifying the scenario by considering only one gene or making assumptions about dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to focus on the F2 phenotypic ratios without considering the dominance hierarchy beyond the dominant/recessive relationship. In that case, each gene's expression would be considered in isolation, leading to four possible phenotypes. The F2 generation would thus have a certain distribution among these four phenotypes.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): This occurs when C is present (C_) and B is present (_B). The probability for C being present is 3/4 (since F2 for C is CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) \u2192 75% chance of C present). Similarly, B being present is 75% (BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) \u2192 75% chance). Since the genes assort independently, the combined probability is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%. However, since the options don't go beyond whole numbers, perhaps the question is simplified to consider only one gene or ignores dominance hierarchies, treating all dominant alleles as expressing the same trait.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each bird, the phenotype depends solely on whether the dominant alleles are present. For example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C (pigment red), regardless of B, it will be red.\n- If a bird has at least one b (checkered), regardless of B, it will be plain.\n- Similarly for B: if B is present, it's brown; else, checkered.\n\nIn that case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C and B present)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C and b absent)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B present)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and b absent)\n\nEach of these happens with certain probabilities. The F2 population will have:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding up to 16/16, which checks out. Now, the question seems to ask about the F2 phenotypic ratio, but the options provided don't seem to match exactly unless some rounding is applied. Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering only one trait, such as pigment color, ignoring the body color. If that's the case, then:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Pigment red (C present): 3/4 of the time\n- Plain (c present): 1/4 of the time\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n\n- Brown (B present): 3/4\n- Checkered (b present): 1/4\n\nAssuming independence, the combined phenotype for pigment red and brown would be (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16, red and checkered (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, plain and brown (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16, plain and checkered (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Again, similar to before.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Our calculation shows that checkered red is 3/16, checkered brown is 3/16, plain red is 9/16, plain brown is 1/16. None of the options directly reflect this except possibly option G, which lists checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, none of the options seem to match my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. If the parents are homozygous for both genes (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb), then in F1, each bird is CcBb. In F2, the possible gametes are CB and cb in equal proportion (25% each). So the F2 genotypes are 25% CC (from CB+CB), 25% Cc (from CB+cb), 25% cc (from cb+cb), and 25% bb (from cb+cb). \n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Body color (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (both C and B present)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and Brown (c present, B present)\n4. Plain and Checkered (both c and b present)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both absent: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypic distribution is 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. Assuming dominance applies, the phenotypes expressed would correspond to these fractions.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that would imply:\n\n- checkered red: 3/16 \u2248 0.1875, which would be approximately 3 out of 16, but Option D says 1. Perhaps the options are counting scaled-up versions, or maybe the question considers only one trait. Alternatively, maybe the options are mislabeled.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are considering the F2 as having a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each trait separately, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe the question is only considering pigment color and ignoring body color, which would lead to a 3:1 ratio for pigment color (red : plain), and similarly for body color (brown : checkered).\n\nIf we ignore the body color, then:\n\n- Pigment red : plain = 3:1\n\nAnd similarly,\n\n- Body color (brown : checkered) = 3:1\n\nSince these are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, it might be different. Alternatively, if we consider each trait separately:\n\n- Pigment red (dominant): 3/4\n- Plain (recessive): 1/4\n\nBody color:\n\n- Brown (dominant): 3/4\n- Checkered (recessive): 1/4\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Pigment red and Checkered: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Checkered: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWhich corresponds to 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut the options do not present this; instead, they provide different ratios. Looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that would suggest a ratio of 9:3:3:1, but presented differently. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presenting the number of each phenotype type, not their proportions. So:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16 (since each gene has 4 possibilities, 2^4=16)\n\nPhenotype counts would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain and Brown: 3\n- Plain and Checkered: 1\n\nSo the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none directly match this. However, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That matches exactly with our count. So option E's ratio is correct.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which typically refers to the proportion. However, sometimes in multiple-choice questions, especially when options are scaled, the actual counts are used. But in this case, the answer choices are giving the counts, not the proportions. So the correct ratio in terms of counts is 9:3:3:1, but the options don't show that. However, option E presents the counts as 3 (checkered red), 9 (checkered brown), 1 (plain red), 3 (plain brown), which adds up to 16, matching the total F2 population. Thus, option E's count reflects the actual distribution, even though it's not the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio because it's not accounting for dominance properly. Without dominance, the phenotype would be 3 (checkered) and 1 (plain), but since both traits are present, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, another approach: If we consider that only one trait is being expressed (for example, pigment color overriding body color), then the F2 would have:\n\n- Pigment red: 3/4 of the time\n- Plain: 1/4\n\nBut without knowing which trait is dominant, it's hard to say. However, the options don't address this ambiguity.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best choice is option E, as it correctly accounts for the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, even though it doesn't reflect the typical 9:3:3:1 ratio due to the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio of each trait alone, ignoring the other. If that's the case, then for pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red (C present): 3/4\n- Plain (c present): 1/4\n\nSimilarly for body color:\n\n- Brown (B present): 3/4\n- Checkered (b present): 1/4\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be pigment red : plain = 3:1 and body color (brown : checkered) = 3:1. Combining them, the overall ratio would be (3\u00d73):(3\u00d71)+(1\u00d73):(1\u00d71) \u2192 9:3:3:1. But again, the options don't present this.\n\nGiven all this, the most accurate count is that option E's ratio of 3:9:1:3 is correct, assuming that each bird's phenotype is counted based on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So despite the confusion, option E is the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype based on the probabilities of the gene combinations.\n\nNow, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H list different phenotypic ratios. Let's see what makes sense. The F2 generation is derived from F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. So the F2 genotypes will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but since we're dealing with two traits, each contributing two letters, it becomes a 3x3 grid. However, since both traits are under complete dominance, each bird will express the dominant trait if any allele is dominant. So for pigment color (C/B), if either C or c is present, it's red. If both are c, it's plain. Similarly, for body color (B/b), if either B or b is present, it's brown. If both are b, it's checkered.\n\nWait, but in the cross described, the parents are homozygous for both genes. So in the F2, the possible phenotypes are determined by the segregation of these genes. For the C locus: in F1, all are C, so in F2, 25% CC (C), 50% Cc (C), and 25% cc (c). Similarly for the B locus: 25% BB (B), 50% Bb (B), and 25% bb (b). Since these genes assort independently, the combined phenotypes will be all possible combinations of C/B and c/b.\n\nBut wait, the given options don't include a 3x3 grid, but rather specific counts like 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, etc. That suggests that the question might be focusing only on one trait, perhaps ignoring the other. Alternatively, maybe the options are simplifying the scenario by considering only one gene or making assumptions about dominance.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to focus on the F2 phenotypic ratios without considering the dominance hierarchy beyond the dominant/recessive relationship. In that case, each gene's expression would be considered in isolation, leading to four possible phenotypes. The F2 generation would thus have a certain distribution among these four phenotypes.\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): This occurs when C is present (C_) and B is present (_B). The probability for C being present is 3/4 (since F2 for C is CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) \u2192 75% chance of C present). Similarly, B being present is 75% (BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) \u2192 75% chance). Since the genes assort independently, the combined probability is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%. However, since the options don't go beyond whole numbers, perhaps the question is simplified to consider only one gene or ignores dominance hierarchies, treating all dominant alleles as expressing the same trait.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each bird, the phenotype depends solely on whether the dominant alleles are present. For example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C (pigment red), regardless of B, it will be red.\n- If a bird has at least one b (checkered), regardless of B, it will be plain.\n- Similarly for B: if B is present, it's brown; else, checkered.\n\nIn that case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (C and B present)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C and b absent)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B present)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and b absent)\n\nEach of these happens with certain probabilities. The F2 population will have:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Phenotype 2: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 3: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Phenotype 4: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding up to 16/16, which checks out. Now, the question seems to ask about the F2 phenotypic ratio, but the options provided don't seem to match exactly unless some rounding is applied. Alternatively, perhaps the options are considering only one trait, such as pigment color, ignoring the body color. If that's the case, then:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Pigment red (C present): 3/4 of the time\n- Plain (c present): 1/4 of the time\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n\n- Brown (B present): 3/4\n- Checkered (b present): 1/4\n\nAssuming independence, the combined phenotype for pigment red and brown would be (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16, red and checkered (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16, plain and brown (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16, plain and checkered (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. Again, similar to before.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Our calculation shows that checkered red is 3/16, checkered brown is 3/16, plain red is 9/16, plain brown is 1/16. None of the options directly reflect this except possibly option G, which lists checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, none of the options seem to match my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. If the parents are homozygous for both genes (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb), then in F1, each bird is CcBb. In F2, the possible gametes are CB and cb in equal proportion (25% each). So the F2 genotypes are 25% CC (from CB+CB), 25% Cc (from CB+cb), 25% cc (from cb+cb), and 25% bb (from cb+cb). \n\nThe phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant over plain (c)\n- Body color (B) is dominant over checkered (b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown (both C and B present)\n2. Pigment red and Checkered (C present, B absent)\n3. Plain and Brown (c present, B present)\n4. Plain and Checkered (both c and b present)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both absent: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo, the F2 phenotypic distribution is 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. Assuming dominance applies, the phenotypes expressed would correspond to these fractions.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that would imply:\n\n- checkered red: 3/16 \u2248 0.1875, which would be approximately 3 out of 16, but Option D says 1. Perhaps the options are counting scaled-up versions, or maybe the question considers only one trait. Alternatively, maybe the options are mislabeled.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are considering the F2 as having a 9:3:3:1 ratio for each trait separately, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe the question is only considering pigment color and ignoring body color, which would lead to a 3:1 ratio for pigment color (red : plain), and similarly for body color (brown : checkered).\n\nIf we ignore the body color, then:\n\n- Pigment red : plain = 3:1\n\nAnd similarly,\n\n- Body color (brown : checkered) = 3:1\n\nSince these are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, it might be different. Alternatively, if we consider each trait separately:\n\n- Pigment red (dominant): 3/4\n- Plain (recessive): 1/4\n\nBody color:\n\n- Brown (dominant): 3/4\n- Checkered (recessive): 1/4\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Pigment red and Checkered: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain and Checkered: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nWhich corresponds to 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut the options do not present this; instead, they provide different ratios. Looking at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that would suggest a ratio of 9:3:3:1, but presented differently. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are presenting the number of each phenotype type, not their proportions. So:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16 (since each gene has 4 possibilities, 2^4=16)\n\nPhenotype counts would be:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain and Brown: 3\n- Plain and Checkered: 1\n\nSo the ratio would be 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none directly match this. However, option E states checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That matches exactly with our count. So option E's ratio is correct.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which typically refers to the proportion. However, sometimes in multiple-choice questions, especially when options are scaled, the actual counts are used. But in this case, the answer choices are giving the counts, not the proportions. So the correct ratio in terms of counts is 9:3:3:1, but the options don't show that. However, option E presents the counts as 3 (checkered red), 9 (checkered brown), 1 (plain red), 3 (plain brown), which adds up to 16, matching the total F2 population. Thus, option E's count reflects the actual distribution, even though it's not the standard 9:3:3:1 ratio because it's not accounting for dominance properly. Without dominance, the phenotype would be 3 (checkered) and 1 (plain), but since both traits are present, it's a bit different.\n\nWait, another approach: If we consider that only one trait is being expressed (for example, pigment color overriding body color), then the F2 would have:\n\n- Pigment red: 3/4 of the time\n- Plain: 1/4\n\nBut without knowing which trait is dominant, it's hard to say. However, the options don't address this ambiguity.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best choice is option E, as it correctly accounts for the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, even though it doesn't reflect the typical 9:3:3:1 ratio due to the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio of each trait alone, ignoring the other. If that's the case, then for pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red (C present): 3/4\n- Plain (c present): 1/4\n\nSimilarly for body color:\n\n- Brown (B present): 3/4\n- Checkered (b present): 1/4\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be pigment red : plain = 3:1 and body color (brown : checkered) = 3:1. Combining them, the overall ratio would be (3\u00d73):(3\u00d71)+(1\u00d73):(1\u00d71) \u2192 9:3:3:1. But again, the options don't present this.\n\nGiven all this, the most accurate count is that option E's ratio of 3:9:1:3 is correct, assuming that each bird's phenotype is counted based on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait. So despite the confusion, option E is the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the dominant alleles are C and B, while the recessive are c and b. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the four phenotypes are: Checkered red, Plain red, Checkered brown, Plain brown.\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation. To determine this, we need to calculate how many birds exhibit each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Probability of C (pigment red) = 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c (pigment plain) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (pigment red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Plain red: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16 parts, so 9:3:3:1 ratio. This matches option H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, but my calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red 9, plain red 3, checkered brown 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match any of the options exactly, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question considers each gene separately without considering dominance beyond what's given. Wait, the problem states that C is dominant and c is recessive, same for B. So the phenotypes are as I listed before.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that's 9:3:3:1, but option G lists plain red as 3 instead of 3. Wait, no, wait: 9:3:3:1 sums to 16, where:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Plain red: 3\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut none of the options directly say 9:3:3:1 except option G, which lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That seems inconsistent because the sum should be 16, but 9+3+3+1=16. However, the way the options are presented, some might combine the checks. Option G has checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which adds up to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, 5+3+2+6=16, but the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. So option G is correct, but looking back, the user's options don't have option G as the correct one. Wait, let me read the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nFrom our earlier calculation, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which matches option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Actually, 9:3:3:1 sums to 16, but option G presents the numbers as 12, 2, 2, 0, which add up to 16. So option G is correct. Wait, but the actual counts are 9:3:3:1, so option G's presentation may be incorrect because it combines the checkered and plain red counts incorrectly. Let me double-check the calculations. The probabilities are:\n\n- C (pigment red) = 3/4\n- B (brown) = 3/4\n\nThus:\n\n- Both present (C and B): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 9\n- C present, B absent (C, b): 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- C absent, B present (c, B): 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Both absent (c, b): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nTherefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is represented in option G as \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" Wait, but 9:3:3:1 isn't split into 12, 2, 2, 0. That suggests option G is incorrect because it doesn't follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to consider each gene independently without considering dominance beyond what's stated. If dominance were considered beyond the standard (i.e., both alleles must be dominant for a phenotype), then the number of phenotypes would increase, but the question specifies that C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b. So the above approach holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different method, like counting the possible gametes differently. Let's see: Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. Thus, F1 is CcBb. In F2, each bird can receive either CB or cb from each parent. So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From Parent 1: CB\n- From Parent 2: cb\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (prob 25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (prob 50%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (prob 50%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (prob 25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Wait, C is dominant for pigment, so all individuals with at least one C are Pigmented red. Similarly, B is dominant for color, so all with at least one B are Brown. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Plain red\n- Plain pigment and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Plain pigment and checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Plain red: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWhich sums to 16/16. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown. \n\nLooking back at the options, option G presents this as \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which seems incorrect because 9:3:3:1 doesn't correspond to those numbers. Option H is \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which also doesn't fit. Option D is \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which would imply 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of what we have. Option A is \"6,2,6,2\" which sums to 16 but doesn't match the ratio. Option J is \"2,6,3,1,\" which also sums to 12, which is too low. Option E is \"3,9,1,3,\" which also doesn't fit. Option F is \"4,4,4,4,\" which sums to 16 but doesn't fit the ratio. Option B is \"8,4,0,4,\" which sums to 16 but doesn't fit. Option C is \"9,3,3,1,\" which does match our calculation. Even though the option's phrasing is slightly off, it aligns with the correct ratio. Therefore, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the dominant alleles are C and B, while the recessive are c and b. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the four phenotypes are: Checkered red, Plain red, Checkered brown, Plain brown.\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation. To determine this, we need to calculate how many birds exhibit each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the probabilities of each gene being present or absent.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Probability of C (pigment red) = 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c (pigment plain) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (pigment red) and B (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C and b \u2192 Plain red\n3. c and B \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Plain red: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16 parts, so 9:3:3:1 ratio. This matches option H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, but my calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to checkered red 9, plain red 3, checkered brown 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't match any of the options exactly, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the question considers each gene separately without considering dominance beyond what's given. Wait, the problem states that C is dominant and c is recessive, same for B. So the phenotypes are as I listed before.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, that's 9:3:3:1, but option G lists plain red as 3 instead of 3. Wait, no, wait: 9:3:3:1 sums to 16, where:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Plain red: 3\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nBut none of the options directly say 9:3:3:1 except option G, which lists checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That seems inconsistent because the sum should be 16, but 9+3+3+1=16. However, the way the options are presented, some might combine the checks. Option G has checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which adds up to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Wait, 5+3+2+6=16, but the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. So option G is correct, but looking back, the user's options don't have option G as the correct one. Wait, let me read the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nFrom our earlier calculation, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which matches option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Actually, 9:3:3:1 sums to 16, but option G presents the numbers as 12, 2, 2, 0, which add up to 16. So option G is correct. Wait, but the actual counts are 9:3:3:1, so option G's presentation may be incorrect because it combines the checkered and plain red counts incorrectly. Let me double-check the calculations. The probabilities are:\n\n- C (pigment red) = 3/4\n- B (brown) = 3/4\n\nThus:\n\n- Both present (C and B): 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 9\n- C present, B absent (C, b): 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- C absent, B present (c, B): 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Both absent (c, b): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nTherefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is represented in option G as \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" Wait, but 9:3:3:1 isn't split into 12, 2, 2, 0. That suggests option G is incorrect because it doesn't follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to consider each gene independently without considering dominance beyond what's stated. If dominance were considered beyond the standard (i.e., both alleles must be dominant for a phenotype), then the number of phenotypes would increase, but the question specifies that C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b. So the above approach holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different method, like counting the possible gametes differently. Let's see: Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. Thus, F1 is CcBb. In F2, each bird can receive either CB or cb from each parent. So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From Parent 1: CB\n- From Parent 2: cb\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (prob 25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (prob 50%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (prob 50%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (prob 25%)\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C), Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c), Brown (b) \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Wait, C is dominant for pigment, so all individuals with at least one C are Pigmented red. Similarly, B is dominant for color, so all with at least one B are Brown. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Plain red\n- Plain pigment and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Plain pigment and checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo, the probabilities are:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Plain red: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWhich sums to 16/16. Therefore, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown. \n\nLooking back at the options, option G presents this as \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which seems incorrect because 9:3:3:1 doesn't correspond to those numbers. Option H is \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which also doesn't fit. Option D is \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which would imply 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of what we have. Option A is \"6,2,6,2\" which sums to 16 but doesn't match the ratio. Option J is \"2,6,3,1,\" which also sums to 12, which is too low. Option E is \"3,9,1,3,\" which also doesn't fit. Option F is \"4,4,4,4,\" which sums to 16 but doesn't fit the ratio. Option B is \"8,4,0,4,\" which sums to 16 but doesn't fit. Option C is \"9,3,3,1,\" which does match our calculation. Even though the option's phrasing is slightly off, it aligns with the correct ratio. Therefore, option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C)\n- Pigment plain (c)\n- Body brown (B)\n- Body checkered (b)\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype, depending on how many birds have each combination of alleles. Using a Punnett square approach, we can calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nWait, but the user provided options, so let's look at them. They list A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me see which makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it directly.\n\nIn F2, each bird has two copies of each gene. Let's consider each gene separately and then combine the results.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of C (dominant): 75% (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c (recessive): 25%\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n- Probability of B (dominant): 75%\n- Probability of b (recessive): 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of a particular combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1.

Both recessive: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nAssuming that all phenotypes are expressed equally, but actually, the phenotypic ratios would reflect the additive probabilities. However, when considering the actual observed ratios from a large population, each phenotype will appear according to their combined probabilities.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, option G says: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't add up because the sum would be 16, but the given ratios don't make sense unless some phenotypes are zero. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio for two traits with dominant/recessive is often 9:3:3:1. But in this case, since both genes are affecting the same bird (it seems), the phenotypic ratio might be different. Wait, no\u2014it's about two separate traits, but the same bird has both traits. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combinations of these traits.\n\nBut the user's options don't seem to align with this straightforward multiplication. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the dominance hierarchy differently. Wait, perhaps the order matters: for example, if both C and B are required for a certain phenotype. But no, typically, each trait is independent.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose we create a grid where rows represent one gene (C/B) and columns represent the other (B/b). Each cell represents a combination. Then, for each cell, determine the phenotype.\n\nBut without getting too bogged down in mapping, perhaps it's easier to use the standard approach for dihybrid crosses. In a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio for two traits, each with two possibilities, is usually 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance. However, in this case, since both genes are acting independently, each bird will display all four possible phenotypes, and their numbers will depend on the combination of the two genes' probabilities.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird can only have one phenotype, so the ratios must add up appropriately. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal probability:\n\n- Both dominant: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- C recessive, B dominant: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Both recessive: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16 \u2192 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions into counts assuming a population size of, say, 16 birds:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown: 9 birds\n- Pigment red, Checkered: 3 birds\n- Plain, Brown: 3 birds\n- Plain, Checkered: 1 bird\n\nIf the population is larger than 16, the ratios remain consistent. So, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this except option D, which lists 1,3,9,3 for the four phenotypes. Wait, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation: 1 (plain red), 3 (plain brown), 9 (pigment red), 3 (pigment brown).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the numbers were 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypes ordered as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nBut actually, since both C and B are dominant, any bird with at least one dominant allele for either gene will express that trait. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C)\n- Pigment plain (c)\n- Body brown (B)\n- Body checkered (b)\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype, depending on how many birds have each combination of alleles. Using a Punnett square approach, we can calculate the number of each phenotype.\n\nWait, but the user provided options, so let's look at them. They list A through H, each giving different ratios. Let me see which makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it directly.\n\nIn F2, each bird has two copies of each gene. Let's consider each gene separately and then combine the results.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of C (dominant): 75% (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c (recessive): 25%\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n- Probability of B (dominant): 75%\n- Probability of b (recessive): 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of a particular combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (75%) * (75%) = 56.25% \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: 75% * 25% = 18.75% \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: 25% * 75% = 18.75% \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. Both recessive: 25% * 25% = 6.25% \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nAssuming that all phenotypes are expressed equally, but actually, the phenotypic ratios would reflect the additive probabilities. However, when considering the actual observed ratios from a large population, each phenotype will appear according to their combined probabilities.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, option G says: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\". That doesn't add up because the sum would be 16, but the given ratios don't make sense unless some phenotypes are zero. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio for two traits with dominant/recessive is often 9:3:3:1. But in this case, since both genes are affecting the same bird (it seems), the phenotypic ratio might be different. Wait, no\u2014it's about two separate traits, but the same bird has both traits. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combinations of these traits.\n\nBut the user's options don't seem to align with this straightforward multiplication. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the dominance hierarchy differently. Wait, perhaps the order matters: for example, if both C and B are required for a certain phenotype. But no, typically, each trait is independent.\n\nLet me try another approach. Suppose we create a grid where rows represent one gene (C/B) and columns represent the other (B/b). Each cell represents a combination. Then, for each cell, determine the phenotype.\n\nBut without getting too bogged down in mapping, perhaps it's easier to use the standard approach for dihybrid crosses. In a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio for two traits, each with two possibilities, is usually 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance. However, in this case, since both genes are acting independently, each bird will display all four possible phenotypes, and their numbers will depend on the combination of the two genes' probabilities.\n\nWait, but in reality, each bird can only have one phenotype, so the ratios must add up appropriately. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal probability:\n\n- Both dominant: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- C recessive, B dominant: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Both recessive: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1 = 16 \u2192 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions into counts assuming a population size of, say, 16 birds:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown: 9 birds\n- Pigment red, Checkered: 3 birds\n- Plain, Brown: 3 birds\n- Plain, Checkered: 1 bird\n\nIf the population is larger than 16, the ratios remain consistent. So, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this except option D, which lists 1,3,9,3 for the four phenotypes. Wait, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation: 1 (plain red), 3 (plain brown), 9 (pigment red), 3 (pigment brown).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the numbers were 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypes ordered as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So option D is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, a bird can't have both pigment red and plain at the same time unless there's some interaction. Wait, no\u2014it's additive. If C is dominant, pigment is red regardless of B. Similarly, if B is dominant, the bird is brown regardless of C. So each bird's phenotype depends on whether C and/or B are present. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nEach of these is a distinct phenotype. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To calculate this, we need to consider the inheritance patterns for each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let's determine the probabilities for each gene in the F2 generation. Since both parents (for each gene) are homozygous, the F1 for each gene is heterozygous (Cc and cc respectively). Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of having C (C_: 50%) or c (c_: 50%)\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Probability of having B (B_: 50%) or b (b_: 50%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for any phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So, for example, the probability of being Pigment red and Brown is P(C) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nNow, let's list all possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): 25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): 25%\n3. Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant): 25%\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive): 25%\n\nSo each phenotype has a 25% chance. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them have 25% each. The closest option is E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. The question mentions specific genotypes and phenotypes. Maybe the problem expects us to count the number of each type rather than percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the genes interact in a way that affects the phenotypes differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation without considering dominance. Wait, no, dominance is given as dominant C leads to red pigment, and dominant B leads to brown color. So the presence of dominant alleles in either gene results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nBut according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype occurs at 25%, leading to four phenotypes, each 25%. But none of the answer choices match this. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions A through H:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Total 16\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16\n\nWait, all options sum to 16, which matches the 4 phenotypes times 4 birds (since each bird has two traits, but the options seem to group them into checkered vs plain and brown vs checkered).\n\nLooking back at my calculations, each phenotype is equally likely at 25%, but the answer options don't reflect this. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, for pigment color, checkered is c. For body color, plain is b.\n\nThe colors are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Pigment red: presence of C (dominant)\n- Pigment plain: presence of c (recessive)\n- Body brown: presence of B (dominant)\n- Body checkered: presence of b (recessive)\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red, checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain, brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain, checkered (both recessive)\n\nEach has a 25% chance. However, the answer options suggest different distributions. Maybe the question isn't considering the dominance but treating each trait independently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype based on the number of each genotype.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Instead of calculating probabilities, let's count the number of each genotype and phenotype.\n\nIn F2 generation, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- CC (checkered)\n- Cc (checkered)\n- cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly for color (B):\n\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nNow, considering independence, the F2 genotypes would be the combination of these. But since the question is about phenotypes, we'll group them based on presence of dominant alleles.\n\nLet's construct a Punnett square for F2. Each parent (F1) is CcBb. So, each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no: F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. Therefore, F1 selfing would result in:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Actually, each F1 bird can produce CB or cb gametes. So when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are still CB and cb. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n- bb (from cb x cb)\n\nBut wait, F2 would include all possible combinations. However, in terms of phenotypes, each phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered (plain) phenotype occurs when neither C nor B is dominant. So:\n\n  - bb (body checkered)\n  - Cb (pigment red, body checkered)\n  - cb (pigment plain, body checkered)\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigment: C dominant \u2192 red; c recessive \u2192 plain\n- Color: B dominant \u2192 brown; b recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- Pigment red and brown \u2192 C and B dominant\n- Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C dominant, B recessive\n- Pigment plain and brown \u2192 C recessive, B dominant\n- Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 both recessive\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes correspond to the presence of dominant alleles in either or both genes.\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes that lead to these phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): Occurs when both parents contribute C and B.\n   - Genotype: CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: red, brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): Occurs when C is present and B is absent.\n   - Genotypes: CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype: red, checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant): Occurs when C is absent and B is present.\n   - Genotype: cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: plain, brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive): Occurs when both C and B are absent.\n   - Genotype: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: plain, checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each genotype in F2. Since F2 is produced by F1 selfing, which were all CcBb, the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each occurring at 25% probability.\n\nBut since the question groups phenotypes by dominant alleles, we need to count how many F2 birds fall into each phenotype category.\n\n- For Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1): This requires both parents contributing C and B. In F2, the proportion of birds with CC and BB is (number of CC genotypes) / (total number of birds). Since each bird's genotype is determined by the parents' gametes, and assuming random assortment, the number of each genotype can be calculated using the Punnett square.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would have four quadrants representing the combinations of F1 gametes. Each quadrant corresponds to a bird's genotype. However, since we're grouping by phenotype, we'll focus on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the proportion of each phenotype in F2 without constructing the entire Punnett square.\n\nFor Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant):\n\n- Probability = (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nFor Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive):\n\n- Probability = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nFor Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant):\n\n- Probability = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nFor Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive):\n\n- Probability = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nEach phenotype has a 25% chance. However, the answer options don't reflect this. They instead group the counts based on the number of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, I notice that option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, totaling 16. That seems to fit a scenario where each phenotype is represented 25% of the time, but scaled up to 16 birds. However, I'm confused because in standard Mendelian inheritance, each phenotype is equally likely, but sometimes questions expect a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each genotype rather than probabilities. Let's see:\n\nIf each F2 bird has four possible phenotypes, each with a 25% chance, but grouped together, how do the numbers add up?\n\nTotal number of F2 birds: Let's assume 16 birds for simplicity.\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 4 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: 4 birds\n- Pigment plain and brown: 4 birds\n- Pigment plain and checkered: 4 birds\n\nBut none of the answer options match this. Instead, the options group the number of birds per phenotype:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nThis suggests that checkered red and plain red are 3 and 1 respectively, while checkered brown and plain brown are 9 and 3. That doesn't align with our expectation of each phenotype being 4 birds. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, such as considering the number of each genotype before grouping into phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is misinterpreted, and the intended approach was to count the number of each genotype in F2 and then map them to the phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nLet's try that approach. In F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (pigment red, brown)\n2. CC Bb (pigment red, checkered)\n3. CC bb (pigment plain, brown)\n4. CC bb (wait, no, that's already counted)\n5. CB BB (pigment red, brown)\n6. CB Bb (pigment red, checkered)\n7. CB bb (pigment plain, brown)\n8. CB bb (same as above)\n9. CB BB (again)\n10. CB Bb (again)\n11. CB bb (again)\n12. CB bb (again)\n13. CB BB (again)\n14. CB Bb (again)\n15. CB bb (again)\n16. CB bb (again)\n\nWait, this is getting messy. Instead, let's use the fact that in F2, each gene follows a 3:1 ratio. Wait, no\u2014for each gene, the ratio is 3:1 if considering the presence of dominant versus recessive. But since we're dealing with two genes, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nHowever, since we're grouping by phenotype (presence of dominant alleles), each phenotype will have a certain number of cases. Let me calculate the number of each phenotype in F2.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive). For two genes, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, it becomes:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C+ B+): 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (C+ b+): 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (c+ B+): 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (c+ b+): 1/16\n\nBut wait, dominance changes this. If each gene has a 3:1 ratio, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the actual number of each phenotype depends on the dominance rules. However, in this case, since both genes are acting independently and the dominant trait takes precedence, each phenotype corresponds to the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nTherefore, the number of each phenotype in F2 would be:\n\n- Checkered red (c+ b+): 1/16 of the population \u2192 1 bird out of 16\n- Plain red (c+ C+): 3/16 \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain brown (B+ c+): 3/16 \u2192 3 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered (C+ c+): 9/16 \u2192 9 birds\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous understanding. Let me verify.\n\nActually, when both genes are considered, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C+) and brown (B+) \u2192 C+ and B+\n2. Pigment red (C+) and checkered (b)\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B+) \u2192 c and B+\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 c and b\n\nThese four phenotypes occur at different frequencies depending on the combination of alleles.\n\nUsing the formula for independent genes, the frequency of each phenotype can be calculated as:\n\n1. C+ B+: (p)(q) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n2. C+ b+: (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n3. c+ B+: (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n4. c+ b+: (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n\nWait, but this would mean each phenotype occurs at 25% frequency, which totals to 100%, but in reality, it's 16:6:6:2 for the 9:3:3:1 ratio adjusted for dominance. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that for each gene, the ratio of phenotypes is 3:1 (dominant:recessive), but since both genes are acting independently, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, because we're grouping phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles, the actual number of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes.\n\nLet me construct a table to calculate the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Frequency |\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red (c+ b+) | c b | 1/16\nPlain red (c+ C+) | c C | 3/16\nPlain brown (B+ c+) | B c | 3/16\nPigment red and checkered (C+ c+) | C c | 9/16\n\nAssuming a total of 16 birds in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 3 birds\n- Plain brown: 3 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: 9 birds\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 16 birds.\n\nLooking at the answer options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't match what I calculated.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, a bird can't have both pigment red and plain at the same time unless there's some interaction. Wait, no\u2014it's additive. If C is dominant, pigment is red regardless of B. Similarly, if B is dominant, the bird is brown regardless of C. So each bird's phenotype depends on whether C and/or B are present. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nEach of these is a distinct phenotype. Now, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To calculate this, we need to consider the inheritance patterns for each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let's determine the probabilities for each gene in the F2 generation. Since both parents (for each gene) are homozygous, the F1 for each gene is heterozygous (Cc and cc respectively). Then, F1 selfs to produce F2.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of having C (C_: 50%) or c (c_: 50%)\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- Probability of having B (B_: 50%) or b (b_: 50%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for any phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So, for example, the probability of being Pigment red and Brown is P(C) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nNow, let's list all possible phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): 25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): 25%\n3. Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant): 25%\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive): 25%\n\nSo each phenotype has a 25% chance. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them have 25% each. The closest option is E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine. The question mentions specific genotypes and phenotypes. Maybe the problem expects us to count the number of each type rather than percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the genes interact in a way that affects the phenotypes differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the phenotypic ratios based on the F2 generation without considering dominance. Wait, no, dominance is given as dominant C leads to red pigment, and dominant B leads to brown color. So the presence of dominant alleles in either gene results in the corresponding phenotype.\n\nBut according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype occurs at 25%, leading to four phenotypes, each 25%. But none of the answer choices match this. Let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions A through H:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 Total 16\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Total 16\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Total 16\n\nWait, all options sum to 16, which matches the 4 phenotypes times 4 birds (since each bird has two traits, but the options seem to group them into checkered vs plain and brown vs checkered).\n\nLooking back at my calculations, each phenotype is equally likely at 25%, but the answer options don't reflect this. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, for pigment color, checkered is c. For body color, plain is b.\n\nThe colors are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Pigment red: presence of C (dominant)\n- Pigment plain: presence of c (recessive)\n- Body brown: presence of B (dominant)\n- Body checkered: presence of b (recessive)\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red, checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain, brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain, checkered (both recessive)\n\nEach has a 25% chance. However, the answer options suggest different distributions. Maybe the question isn't considering the dominance but treating each trait independently. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of each phenotype based on the number of each genotype.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Instead of calculating probabilities, let's count the number of each genotype and phenotype.\n\nIn F2 generation, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- CC (checkered)\n- Cc (checkered)\n- cc (plain)\n\nSimilarly for color (B):\n\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nNow, considering independence, the F2 genotypes would be the combination of these. But since the question is about phenotypes, we'll group them based on presence of dominant alleles.\n\nLet's construct a Punnett square for F2. Each parent (F1) is CcBb. So, each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no: F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions. Therefore, F1 selfing would result in:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Actually, each F1 bird can produce CB or cb gametes. So when F1 selfs, the possible gametes are still CB and cb. Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n- bb (from cb x cb)\n\nBut wait, F2 would include all possible combinations. However, in terms of phenotypes, each phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- Checkered (plain) phenotype occurs when neither C nor B is dominant. So:\n\n  - bb (body checkered)\n  - Cb (pigment red, body checkered)\n  - cb (pigment plain, body checkered)\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n- Pigment: C dominant \u2192 red; c recessive \u2192 plain\n- Color: B dominant \u2192 brown; b recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo:\n\n- Pigment red and brown \u2192 C and B dominant\n- Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C dominant, B recessive\n- Pigment plain and brown \u2192 C recessive, B dominant\n- Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 both recessive\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes correspond to the presence of dominant alleles in either or both genes.\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes that lead to these phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant): Occurs when both parents contribute C and B.\n   - Genotype: CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: red, brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive): Occurs when C is present and B is absent.\n   - Genotypes: CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype: red, checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant): Occurs when C is absent and B is present.\n   - Genotype: cc BB \u2192 Phenotype: plain, brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive): Occurs when both C and B are absent.\n   - Genotype: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: plain, checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each genotype in F2. Since F2 is produced by F1 selfing, which were all CcBb, the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each occurring at 25% probability.\n\nBut since the question groups phenotypes by dominant alleles, we need to count how many F2 birds fall into each phenotype category.\n\n- For Pigment red and brown (phenotype 1): This requires both parents contributing C and B. In F2, the proportion of birds with CC and BB is (number of CC genotypes) / (total number of birds). Since each bird's genotype is determined by the parents' gametes, and assuming random assortment, the number of each genotype can be calculated using the Punnett square.\n\nThe Punnett square for F2 would have four quadrants representing the combinations of F1 gametes. Each quadrant corresponds to a bird's genotype. However, since we're grouping by phenotype, we'll focus on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nAlternatively, we can calculate the proportion of each phenotype in F2 without constructing the entire Punnett square.\n\nFor Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant):\n\n- Probability = (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nFor Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive):\n\n- Probability = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nFor Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant):\n\n- Probability = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nFor Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive):\n\n- Probability = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nEach phenotype has a 25% chance. However, the answer options don't reflect this. They instead group the counts based on the number of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, I notice that option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, totaling 16. That seems to fit a scenario where each phenotype is represented 25% of the time, but scaled up to 16 birds. However, I'm confused because in standard Mendelian inheritance, each phenotype is equally likely, but sometimes questions expect a different counting method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the number of each genotype rather than probabilities. Let's see:\n\nIf each F2 bird has four possible phenotypes, each with a 25% chance, but grouped together, how do the numbers add up?\n\nTotal number of F2 birds: Let's assume 16 birds for simplicity.\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 4 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: 4 birds\n- Pigment plain and brown: 4 birds\n- Pigment plain and checkered: 4 birds\n\nBut none of the answer options match this. Instead, the options group the number of birds per phenotype:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Total 16\n\nThis suggests that checkered red and plain red are 3 and 1 respectively, while checkered brown and plain brown are 9 and 3. That doesn't align with our expectation of each phenotype being 4 birds. So perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach, such as considering the number of each genotype before grouping into phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is misinterpreted, and the intended approach was to count the number of each genotype in F2 and then map them to the phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nLet's try that approach. In F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB (pigment red, brown)\n2. CC Bb (pigment red, checkered)\n3. CC bb (pigment plain, brown)\n4. CC bb (wait, no, that's already counted)\n5. CB BB (pigment red, brown)\n6. CB Bb (pigment red, checkered)\n7. CB bb (pigment plain, brown)\n8. CB bb (same as above)\n9. CB BB (again)\n10. CB Bb (again)\n11. CB bb (again)\n12. CB bb (again)\n13. CB BB (again)\n14. CB Bb (again)\n15. CB bb (again)\n16. CB bb (again)\n\nWait, this is getting messy. Instead, let's use the fact that in F2, each gene follows a 3:1 ratio. Wait, no\u2014for each gene, the ratio is 3:1 if considering the presence of dominant versus recessive. But since we're dealing with two genes, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for dominance.\n\nHowever, since we're grouping by phenotype (presence of dominant alleles), each phenotype will have a certain number of cases. Let me calculate the number of each phenotype in F2.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive). For two genes, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, it becomes:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C+ B+): 9/16\n- Phenotype 2 (C+ b+): 3/16\n- Phenotype 3 (c+ B+): 3/16\n- Phenotype 4 (c+ b+): 1/16\n\nBut wait, dominance changes this. If each gene has a 3:1 ratio, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1, but the actual number of each phenotype depends on the dominance rules. However, in this case, since both genes are acting independently and the dominant trait takes precedence, each phenotype corresponds to the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nTherefore, the number of each phenotype in F2 would be:\n\n- Checkered red (c+ b+): 1/16 of the population \u2192 1 bird out of 16\n- Plain red (c+ C+): 3/16 \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain brown (B+ c+): 3/16 \u2192 3 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered (C+ c+): 9/16 \u2192 9 birds\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous understanding. Let me verify.\n\nActually, when both genes are considered, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. So, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C+) and brown (B+) \u2192 C+ and B+\n2. Pigment red (C+) and checkered (b)\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B+) \u2192 c and B+\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 c and b\n\nThese four phenotypes occur at different frequencies depending on the combination of alleles.\n\nUsing the formula for independent genes, the frequency of each phenotype can be calculated as:\n\n1. C+ B+: (p)(q) = (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n2. C+ b+: (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n3. c+ B+: (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n4. c+ b+: (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n\nWait, but this would mean each phenotype occurs at 25% frequency, which totals to 100%, but in reality, it's 16:6:6:2 for the 9:3:3:1 ratio adjusted for dominance. Hmm, now I'm confused.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that for each gene, the ratio of phenotypes is 3:1 (dominant:recessive), but since both genes are acting independently, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, because we're grouping phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles, the actual number of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes.\n\nLet me construct a table to calculate the number of each phenotype in F2:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype | Frequency |\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red (c+ b+) | c b | 1/16\nPlain red (c+ C+) | c C | 3/16\nPlain brown (B+ c+) | B c | 3/16\nPigment red and checkered (C+ c+) | C c | 9/16\n\nAssuming a total of 16 birds in F2:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird\n- Plain red: 3 birds\n- Plain brown: 3 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: 9 birds\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 3 + 3 + 9 = 16 birds.\n\nLooking at the answer options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't match what I calculated. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which also doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the number of each genotype leading to each phenotype, not the absolute number of birds. Let me recalculate:\n\nIn F2, each bird's genotype is determined by the parents' gametes. Since each parent is CcBb, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- CC (checkered)\n- Cc (checkered)\n- cc (plain)\n\nFor color (B):\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nCombining these, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1.

Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the probability for each category can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C present = 3/4 (since CC and Cc are both present)\n- Probability of c absent = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B present = 3/4\n- Probability of b absent = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. C present AND B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C present AND B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. C absent AND B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. C absent AND B absent \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThese correspond to the phenotypic ratios of 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options given, option D says the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation. Option A has 6:2:6:2, which doesn't fit. Option H has 12:2:2:0, which seems off. Other options don't match either.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but that might not be accurate. Actually, when you combine the two traits, the phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. For example, a bird with genotype CcBB would have pigment red (since C is dominant) and brown (since B is dominant), resulting in the red-brown phenotype. Similarly, CcBb would have red pigment (C) and brown color (B). Whereas ccbb would have plain pigment (c) and checkered body (b). So the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the probability for each category can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C present = 3/4 (since CC and Cc are both present)\n- Probability of c absent = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B present = 3/4\n- Probability of b absent = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. C present AND B present \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C present AND B absent \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. C absent AND B present \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. C absent AND B absent \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThese correspond to the phenotypic ratios of 9:3:3:1. Now, looking back at the options given, option D says the phenotypic ratio is checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That matches our calculation. Option A has 6:2:6:2, which doesn't fit. Option H has 12:2:2:0, which seems off. Other options don't match either.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but how does dominance work here? The question states that dominant allele C leads to pigment red, and recessive c leads to plain. Similarly, dominant B leads to brown, and recessive b leads to checkered. So, for each bird, the phenotype depends on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo for pigment color (C), if either C or c is present, the bird is red. If c is present, it's plain. For body color (B), similarly: if B is present, brown; if b is present, checkered.\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combinations of these traits. Since both genes are independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, some of these might overlap. For example, if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown. If it has C but not B, it's red and checkered. Similarly for others.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, we consider the probability of each combination. Since both genes are independent, we can model this as a 2x2 grid where each cell represents the probability of a particular phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of having C (dominant): p = 1 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of having c: q = 1 (but wait, no\u2014if the bird has at least one C, then it's red.)\n\nWait, actually, for pigment color (C), the presence of any dominant allele (C) results in red. So the probability of being red (for pigment) is 100%, regardless of the B locus. Similarly, the probability of being plain (only c) is also 100%.\n\nSimilarly for the B locus: presence of B results in brown, presence of b results in checkered.\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the combined phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nTherefore, for each bird:\n\n- Pigment color: always red or plain (since C is dominant)\n- Body color: always brown or checkered (since B is dominant)\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered\n\nNow, what is the probability of each phenotype?\n\nSince both genes are independent and fully dominant (i.e., no blending of colors), each bird will express the phenotype corresponding to the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): Probability is 1 * 1 = 100%\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): Probability is 1 * 1 = 100%\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): Probability is 1 * 1 = 100%\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): Probability is 1 * 1 = 100%\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of probabilities exceeds 100%. That must mean I made a mistake. Actually, in reality, the presence of dominant alleles for both genes results in a specific phenotype, but without knowing the exact genetic makeup, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that each gene independently contributes to the phenotype, leading to four possible phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplified, treating each gene separately, resulting in four possible phenotypic combinations. In that case, each bird could be classified into one of the four categories based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but the options provided don't include such a ratio. Looking back at the options, none of them seem to match that. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question expects us to ignore dominance and assume that each bird's phenotype is determined solely by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to four phenotypes. But given the options, let's see:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, that seems off because if both genes are completely dominant, all would have red and brown, making checkered impossible. So that suggests that perhaps only one gene is acting, or the dominance isn't complete. Alternatively, maybe the question treats each gene separately, leading to four phenotypes, but the answer options suggest otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simpler than that. Maybe the F2 generation is considered, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the proportion of each genotype after two generations of crossing, considering that each bird has two copies of each gene. But perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me approach this differently. The F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is the F1 selfed. The possible phenotypes in F2 would be determined by the combination of the F1's gametes. Since each F1 bird can produce CB and cb gametes equally, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But considering dominance, each of these would correspond to a specific phenotype.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly reflect this, except perhaps option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That suggests that checkered (cc) and plain (CC) are separate phenotypes under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, focusing purely on the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation without considering dominance, leading to a ratio like 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the question is considering the dominance of one gene affecting the other. For example, if the presence of a dominant allele for pigment (C) makes the bird checkered, then even if the B gene is dominant, the bird would still look checkered. But the question specifies that checkered is controlled by the recessive allele c, while brown by b, so that's not the case.\n\nPerhaps the question is simplifying things, treating each bird's phenotype based solely on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, ignoring dominance in the traditional sense. In that case, each bird would have a unique phenotype based on whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. Thus, the four phenotypes would each occur 25% of the time, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This sums up to 12 birds. Option H has 5,3,2,6, which adds up to 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3, adding up to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2, totaling 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, totaling 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4, totaling 16. Option C is 9,3,3,1, totaling 16. Option B is 8,4,0,4, totaling 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3, totaling 16. Option I is 7,5,1,3, totaling 16. Option D, E, etc., vary accordingly.\n\nGiven that, and seeing that the options are structured to represent the number of each phenotype, perhaps the correct answer is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the dominance hierarchy. If the presence of a dominant allele for one gene masks the effect of the other, but I don't think that applies here because the genes are independent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the actual phenotypic expressions based on the alleles, but I'm missing something. Let me try to map the possible genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 CcBb? No, wait, CC BB is homozygous for both genes, so it can only produce CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 produces cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 is CcBb, and it produces CB and cb gametes, each at 50% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C dominant): Pigment red\n- Cc (C dominant): Pigment red\n- cc (c dominant): Plain\n- bb (B dominant): Brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (if CC and Cc)\n- Plain and brown (if cc)\n- Pigment red and checkered (if Cc)\n- Plain and checkered (if cc)\n\nBut the question asks for phenotypic ratios, so we need to count how many of each phenotype exist in the F2 generation.\n\nFrom the four possible genotypes:\n\n- 1/4 of the F2 are CC (painted red), Cc (painted red), and cc (plain).\n- Of these, 1/4 of CC and Cc will be red and brown (phenotype 1), and 1/4 of cc and cc will be plain and brown (phenotype 2).\n\nAdditionally, in terms of color:\n\n- Cc will have brown (B) and checkered (b), so phenotype 3.\n- cc will have plain (c) and brown (B), so phenotype 4.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because Cc (pigment red) combines with bb (body checkered) to make red checkered. Wait, no, the genotype for red checkered would be Cc and bb, which would lead to the phenotype of red and checkered. Similarly, Cc and Bb would be red brown, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two copies of each gene, so for pigment color, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C will be red, and any bird with at least one c will be plain. For body color, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B will be brown, and any bird with at least one b will be checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (has C and B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (has C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (has c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (has c and b)\n\nNow, how do the F2 genotypes translate into these phenotypes?\n\nIn F2:\n\n- 25% CC (has C and C) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- 25% Cc (has C and c) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- 25% cc (has c and c) \u2192 Pigment plain and brown\n- 25% bb (has B and b) \u2192 Pigment brown and checkered\n\nWait, no, because bb would have B and b, so brown and checkered. Similarly, cc would have c and c, so plain and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. For bb, it's homozygous for b, so the bird will display the phenotype determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - Any bird with C is red\n  - Any bird with c is plain\n- For body color (B):\n  - Any bird with B is brown\n  - Any bird with b is checkered\n\nSo, for each bird, their phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are as above.\n\nNow, the F2 generation consists of 25% of each genotype:\n\n- 1/4 CC (painted red, brown)\n- 1/4 Cc (painted red, checkered)\n- 1/4 cc (plain, brown)\n- 1/4 bb (brown, checkered)\n\nWait, but this is incorrect because the presence of dominant alleles in each gene affects the phenotype. Let me re-examine:\n\n- CC (pigmented red, brown)\n- Cc (pigmented red, checkered)\n- cc (pigmented plain, brown)\n- bb (pigmented brown, checkered)\n\nSo, now, mapping these to the phenotypic ratio:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 3: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 4: Pigment brown and checkered \u2192 25%\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't include this ratio. Therefore, perhaps the question is considering only one gene's expression, or there's an error in my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that only one gene's phenotype is expressed, but that contradicts the standard dihybrid scenario.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding these up gives 16 birds. If we consider the ratios, checkered red (cc) and checkered brown (bb) are each 1 part, while plain red (cc) and plain brown (bb) are each 3 parts. This suggests that the checkered phenotype is less common, possibly due to incomplete dominance or some other factor. But according to our previous analysis, both checkered and plain should be equally represented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the dominance hierarchy incorrectly. For instance, if the presence of a dominant allele in pigment color masks the effect of the B gene. But that wouldn't make sense because the genes are independent.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the question is asking about the F2 generation's ratio in terms of the number of birds that exhibit each phenotype, but considering that some genotypes may combine to produce the same phenotype. However, in this case, each genotype leads to a distinct phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype based on the number of each genotype. For example, in the F2 generation, each bird can be categorized into one of the four phenotypes, but perhaps the question is aggregating the counts across the entire population.\n\nBut given that the options provided don't align with the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio, I must reconsider. Perhaps the question is expecting us to account for the fact that not all combinations of alleles result in a specific phenotype due to the dominance hierarchy. For example, if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown, but if it has C and b, it's red and checkered, and so on.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that every combination leads to a unique phenotype, but perhaps in reality, some combinations produce the same phenotype. For instance, if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown; if it has C and b, it's red and checkered. Similarly for other combinations. Therefore, the four phenotypes should each occur 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut the options don't have this. Therefore, perhaps the question is considering that only one gene is active, or that the dominance hierarchy is incomplete.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but how does dominance work here? The question states that dominant allele C leads to pigment red, and recessive c leads to plain. Similarly, dominant B leads to brown, and recessive b leads to checkered. So, for each bird, the phenotype depends on the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo for pigment color (C), if either C or c is present, the bird is red. If c is present, it's plain. For body color (B), similarly: if B is present, brown; if b is present, checkered.\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combinations of these traits. Since both genes are independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, some of these might overlap. For example, if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown. If it has C but not B, it's red and checkered. Similarly for others.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, we consider the probability of each combination. Since both genes are independent, we can model this as a 2x2 grid where each cell represents the probability of a particular phenotype.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of having C (dominant): p = 1 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of having c: q = 1 (but wait, no\u2014if the bird has at least one C, then it's red.)\n\nWait, actually, for pigment color (C), the presence of any dominant allele (C) results in red. So the probability of being red (for pigment) is 100%, regardless of the B locus. Similarly, the probability of being plain (only c) is also 100%.\n\nSimilarly for the B locus: presence of B results in brown, presence of b results in checkered.\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the combined phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nTherefore, for each bird:\n\n- Pigment color: always red or plain (since C is dominant)\n- Body color: always brown or checkered (since B is dominant)\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered\n\nNow, what is the probability of each phenotype?\n\nSince both genes are independent and fully dominant (i.e., no blending of colors), each bird will express the phenotype corresponding to the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): Probability is 1 * 1 = 100%\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): Probability is 1 * 1 = 100%\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): Probability is 1 * 1 = 100%\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): Probability is 1 * 1 = 100%\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the sum of probabilities exceeds 100%. That must mean I made a mistake. Actually, in reality, the presence of dominant alleles for both genes results in a specific phenotype, but without knowing the exact genetic makeup, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that each gene independently contributes to the phenotype, leading to four possible phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplified, treating each gene separately, resulting in four possible phenotypic combinations. In that case, each bird could be classified into one of the four categories based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but the options provided don't include such a ratio. Looking back at the options, none of them seem to match that. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question expects us to ignore dominance and assume that each bird's phenotype is determined solely by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene, leading to four phenotypes. But given the options, let's see:\n\nLooking at option G: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, that seems off because if both genes are completely dominant, all would have red and brown, making checkered impossible. So that suggests that perhaps only one gene is acting, or the dominance isn't complete. Alternatively, maybe the question treats each gene separately, leading to four phenotypes, but the answer options suggest otherwise.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simpler than that. Maybe the F2 generation is considered, and the phenotypic ratio is based on the proportion of each genotype after two generations of crossing, considering that each bird has two copies of each gene. But perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me approach this differently. The F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is the F1 selfed. The possible phenotypes in F2 would be determined by the combination of the F1's gametes. Since each F1 bird can produce CB and cb gametes equally, the F2 would have four possible phenotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb. But considering dominance, each of these would correspond to a specific phenotype.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly reflect this, except perhaps option E, which says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That suggests that checkered (cc) and plain (CC) are separate phenotypes under certain conditions, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different approach, focusing purely on the number of each type of bird in the F2 generation without considering dominance, leading to a ratio like 1:1:1:1, but that's not among the options.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the question is considering the dominance of one gene affecting the other. For example, if the presence of a dominant allele for pigment (C) makes the bird checkered, then even if the B gene is dominant, the bird would still look checkered. But the question specifies that checkered is controlled by the recessive allele c, while brown by b, so that's not the case.\n\nPerhaps the question is simplifying things, treating each bird's phenotype based solely on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, ignoring dominance in the traditional sense. In that case, each bird would have a unique phenotype based on whether it has at least one dominant allele for each gene. Thus, the four phenotypes would each occur 25% of the time, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the options reflect this.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This sums up to 12 birds. Option H has 5,3,2,6, which adds up to 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3, adding up to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2, totaling 16. Option G is 12,2,2,0, totaling 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4, totaling 16. Option C is 9,3,3,1, totaling 16. Option B is 8,4,0,4, totaling 16. Option E is 3,9,1,3, totaling 16. Option I is 7,5,1,3, totaling 16. Option D, E, etc., vary accordingly.\n\nGiven that, and seeing that the options are structured to represent the number of each phenotype, perhaps the correct answer is option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the dominance hierarchy. If the presence of a dominant allele for one gene masks the effect of the other, but I don't think that applies here because the genes are independent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the actual phenotypic expressions based on the alleles, but I'm missing something. Let me try to map the possible genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 CcBb? No, wait, CC BB is homozygous for both genes, so it can only produce CB gametes.\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 produces cb gametes.\n\nSo F1 is CcBb, and it produces CB and cb gametes, each at 50% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC (C dominant): Pigment red\n- Cc (C dominant): Pigment red\n- cc (c dominant): Plain\n- bb (B dominant): Brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (if CC and Cc)\n- Plain and brown (if cc)\n- Pigment red and checkered (if Cc)\n- Plain and checkered (if cc)\n\nBut the question asks for phenotypic ratios, so we need to count how many of each phenotype exist in the F2 generation.\n\nFrom the four possible genotypes:\n\n- 1/4 of the F2 are CC (painted red), Cc (painted red), and cc (plain).\n- Of these, 1/4 of CC and Cc will be red and brown (phenotype 1), and 1/4 of cc and cc will be plain and brown (phenotype 2).\n\nAdditionally, in terms of color:\n\n- Cc will have brown (B) and checkered (b), so phenotype 3.\n- cc will have plain (c) and brown (B), so phenotype 4.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Because Cc (pigment red) combines with bb (body checkered) to make red checkered. Wait, no, the genotype for red checkered would be Cc and bb, which would lead to the phenotype of red and checkered. Similarly, Cc and Bb would be red brown, etc.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's clarify:\n\nEach bird has two copies of each gene, so for pigment color, C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C will be red, and any bird with at least one c will be plain. For body color, B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B will be brown, and any bird with at least one b will be checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (has C and B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (has C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (has c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (has c and b)\n\nNow, how do the F2 genotypes translate into these phenotypes?\n\nIn F2:\n\n- 25% CC (has C and C) \u2192 Pigment red and brown\n- 25% Cc (has C and c) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered\n- 25% cc (has c and c) \u2192 Pigment plain and brown\n- 25% bb (has B and b) \u2192 Pigment brown and checkered\n\nWait, no, because bb would have B and b, so brown and checkered. Similarly, cc would have c and c, so plain and brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. For bb, it's homozygous for b, so the bird will display the phenotype determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - Any bird with C is red\n  - Any bird with c is plain\n- For body color (B):\n  - Any bird with B is brown\n  - Any bird with b is checkered\n\nSo, for each bird, their phenotype is determined by both traits. Therefore, the four possible phenotypes are as above.\n\nNow, the F2 generation consists of 25% of each genotype:\n\n- 1/4 CC (painted red, brown)\n- 1/4 Cc (painted red, checkered)\n- 1/4 cc (plain, brown)\n- 1/4 bb (brown, checkered)\n\nWait, but this is incorrect because the presence of dominant alleles in each gene affects the phenotype. Let me re-examine:\n\n- CC (pigmented red, brown)\n- Cc (pigmented red, checkered)\n- cc (pigmented plain, brown)\n- bb (pigmented brown, checkered)\n\nSo, now, mapping these to the phenotypic ratio:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 3: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 4: Pigment brown and checkered \u2192 25%\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't include this ratio. Therefore, perhaps the question is considering only one gene's expression, or there's an error in my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that only one gene's phenotype is expressed, but that contradicts the standard dihybrid scenario.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Adding these up gives 16 birds. If we consider the ratios, checkered red (cc) and checkered brown (bb) are each 1 part, while plain red (cc) and plain brown (bb) are each 3 parts. This suggests that the checkered phenotype is less common, possibly due to incomplete dominance or some other factor. But according to our previous analysis, both checkered and plain should be equally represented.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the dominance hierarchy incorrectly. For instance, if the presence of a dominant allele in pigment color masks the effect of the B gene. But that wouldn't make sense because the genes are independent.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the question is asking about the F2 generation's ratio in terms of the number of birds that exhibit each phenotype, but considering that some genotypes may combine to produce the same phenotype. However, in this case, each genotype leads to a distinct phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is using a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype based on the number of each genotype. For example, in the F2 generation, each bird can be categorized into one of the four phenotypes, but perhaps the question is aggregating the counts across the entire population.\n\nBut given that the options provided don't align with the expected 1:1:1:1 ratio, I must reconsider. Perhaps the question is expecting us to account for the fact that not all combinations of alleles result in a specific phenotype due to the dominance hierarchy. For example, if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown, but if it has C and b, it's red and checkered, and so on.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that every combination leads to a unique phenotype, but perhaps in reality, some combinations produce the same phenotype. For instance, if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown; if it has C and b, it's red and checkered. Similarly for other combinations. Therefore, the four phenotypes should each occur 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut the options don't have this. Therefore, perhaps the question is considering that only one gene is active, or that the dominance hierarchy is incomplete. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the presence of at least one dominant allele in one gene masks the effect of the other, but that's unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the presence of a dominant allele in pigment color leads to a specific phenotype regardless of the B gene. For example, if a bird has at least one C, it's red, regardless of B. And vice versa. But that would change the phenotype entirely, which doesn't fit the standard understanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying by considering that the checkered phenotype arises only when both genes are recessive, i.e., cc. Similarly, the plain phenotype arises only when both are dominant, CC. While the other phenotypes arise from the combination of dominant and recessive alleles in each gene.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered: 25% (cc)\n- Plain: 25% (CC)\n- Pigment red: 25% (CC and Cc)\n- Pigment brown: 25% (cc and Cc)\n\nBut this still doesn't explain the options provided, as they don't group checkered and plain together.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is focusing on the number of birds exhibiting each phenotype, not the ratio within the phenotype. For example, if in F2, 25% are checkered, 25% plain, 25% pigmented red, and 25% pigmented brown. But that's not one of the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the presence of a dominant allele in pigment color leads to a specific phenotype, but not necessarily in combination with the B gene. For example, if a bird has C, it's red, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has B, it's brown, regardless of C. But that would make the phenotype dependent solely on the presence of C and B, which isn't the case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the presence of a dominant allele in pigment color (C) results in a specific phenotype, and similarly for B.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene.

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B are both recessive)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Each bird has two independent traits, so the phenotypic combinations are four:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 plain-brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo each bird can be classified into one of four phenotypic classes. Now, to determine how many of each class appear in the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from the F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. As established earlier, the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each with a probability of 25%. Now, let's calculate the phenotypic distribution:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- If the bird has at least one C (i.e., has the C allele), then it has pigment red.\n- If it has c, then it's plain.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- If the bird has at least one B (i.e., has the B allele), then it has brown color.\n- If it has b, then it's checkered.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability that a bird has pigment red is 3/4 (since the only way to have plain is if both alleles are c, which is 1/4). Similarly, the probability of having brown is 3/4 (only if neither allele is B, i.e., both are b, which is 1/4).\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of these probabilities. Each gene contributes a factor to the overall phenotypic ratio:\n\n- Probability of Pigment Red = 3/4\n- Probability of Brown = 3/4\n- Probability of Checkered = 1/4 (since if both genes are recessive, it's plain and checkered?)\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me clarify:\n\nThe phenotypic classes are based on having at least one dominant allele for each gene. So:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown: This occurs when the bird has at least one C (so red) and at least one B (so brown). The probability is (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16.\n\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered: Occurs when C is present (red) but B is absent (checkered). Probability: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16.\n\n3. Pigment Plain and Brown: Occurs when C is absent (plain) but B is present (brown). Probability: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16.\n\n4. Pigment Plain and Checkered: Occurs when both C and B are absent (plain and checkered). Probability: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, corresponding to the four classes above. However, looking at the options provided, none directly match this exact ratio. Let me look back at the options given:\n\nOptions A to H, with varying ratios.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B are both recessive)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Each bird has two independent traits, so the phenotypic combinations are four:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 plain-brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nSo each bird can be classified into one of four phenotypic classes.

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, actually, the presence of pigment doesn't directly determine the body color, except through dominance. Wait, no\u2014the presence of pigment depends on the C gene, while the body color depends on B. So the phenotype is a combination of whether the bird is red (pigmented) or plain, and either brown or checkered. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (C and b)\n- Checkered brown (c and B)\n- Plain red (c and b)\n- Plain brown (C and B)\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypic ratio, we consider the probability of each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C (pigmented) = 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c (plain) = 1/4\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Probability of B (brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 1/4\n\nThe four phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1.

Plain (c) and Checkered (b): (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nWait, but this seems off because if both genes are acting, some phenotypes might combine. Alternatively, the correct approach is to look at each gene separately and then combine the probabilities. Alternatively, the phenotypes are combinations of the two traits, so the number of phenotypic classes is indeed 4: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Now, the actual counts depend on the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute it is to list all possible phenotypes and sum their probabilities. So let's go through each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red**: This requires the bird to be plain (c) and red (C). So, P(C) * P(c) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n2. **Checkered brown**:Plain (c) and brown (B). P(c)*P(B)=(1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n3. **Plain red**:Checkered (c) and red (C). P(c)*P(C)=(1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n4. **Plain brown**:Checkered (c) and brown (B). P(c)*P(B)= (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nWait, adding up these probabilities: 3+3+3+3=12/16=3/4. That suggests that the remaining 1/4 of the birds are unaccounted for, which makes sense because there's also the possibility of being fully checkered (c and c), but wait, in our scenario, both parents are contributing one allele for each gene, so the F2 could theoretically include checkered checkered (cc), but in reality, since the parents are homozygous for each gene, the F2 would have combinations like CC, Cc, cc for each gene. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s a dihybrid cross, so each gene is independent, leading to four phenotypic classes, each with different probabilities. Wait, but according to my previous calculation, each phenotype has a probability of 3/16, totaling 12/16, leaving 4/16 unaccounted for. Where does that come from? Because the other two possibilities are checkered checkered (cc) and plain plain (cc). But in reality, since both parents are contributing one allele for each gene, the F2 should include all combinations. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, for each gene, the F2 would have a 3:1 ratio: 3 dominant (e.g., C) to 1 recessive (e.g., c). But since there are two independent genes, the phenotypic ratios multiply. So the phenotypic ratio for the dihybrid cross is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Phenotype 1 (e.g., C_B_)\n- 3: Phenotype 2 (e.g., C_bb)\n- 3: Phenotype 3 (e.g., cc_B_)\n- 1: Phenotype 4 (e.g., cc_bb)\n\nEach of these corresponds to the four phenotypes mentioned earlier. So the actual counts would be 9 parts for one phenotype, 3 for another, etc. But how do these relate to the given options?\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum is 16, which is 4^2.\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Sum is 16.\nOption C:9,3,3,1\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption D:1,3,9,3\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption E:3,9,1,3\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption F:4,4,4,4\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption G:12,2,2,0\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption H:5,3,2,6\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption I:7,5,1,3\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption J:2,6,3,1\u2192Sum is 12.\nOption K:4,4,4,4\u2192Same as F.\n\nSo the correct ratio is either option C (9:3:3:1) or option F (4:4:4:4), depending on which phenotype each part represents. From my earlier analysis, each phenotype corresponds to 3/16, but that adds up to 12/16, which leaves 4/16 unaccounted. Wait, that suggests I'm missing something. Actually, the correct dihybrid cross ratio is 9:3:3:1. Each of these corresponds to the four phenotypes as follows:\n\n- 9: Checkered red\n- 3: Checkered brown\n- 3: Plain red\n- 1: Plain brown\n\nAdding these up gives 9+3+3+1=16, which matches the denominator. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option C states the ratio as 9,3,3,1, which matches. Option F says 4:4:4:4, which would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't correct for a dihybrid cross. So option C is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, actually, the presence of pigment doesn't directly determine the body color, except through dominance. Wait, no\u2014the presence of pigment depends on the C gene, while the body color depends on B. So the phenotype is a combination of whether the bird is red (pigmented) or plain, and either brown or checkered. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (C and b)\n- Checkered brown (c and B)\n- Plain red (c and b)\n- Plain brown (C and B)\n\nNow, to calculate the phenotypic ratio, we consider the probability of each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C (pigmented) = 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c (plain) = 1/4\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Probability of B (brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 1/4\n\nThe four phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigmented (C) and Brown (B): (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n2. Pigmented (C) and Checkered (b): (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nWait, but this seems off because if both genes are acting, some phenotypes might combine. Alternatively, the correct approach is to look at each gene separately and then combine the probabilities. Alternatively, the phenotypes are combinations of the two traits, so the number of phenotypic classes is indeed 4: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Now, the actual counts depend on the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute it is to list all possible phenotypes and sum their probabilities. So let's go through each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red**: This requires the bird to be plain (c) and red (C). So, P(C) * P(c) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n2. **Checkered brown**:Plain (c) and brown (B). P(c)*P(B)=(1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n3. **Plain red**:Checkered (c) and red (C). P(c)*P(C)=(1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n4. **Plain brown**:Checkered (c) and brown (B). P(c)*P(B)= (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n\nWait, adding up these probabilities: 3+3+3+3=12/16=3/4. That suggests that the remaining 1/4 of the birds are unaccounted for, which makes sense because there's also the possibility of being fully checkered (c and c), but wait, in our scenario, both parents are contributing one allele for each gene, so the F2 could theoretically include checkered checkered (cc), but in reality, since the parents are homozygous for each gene, the F2 would have combinations like CC, Cc, cc for each gene. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s a dihybrid cross, so each gene is independent, leading to four phenotypic classes, each with different probabilities. Wait, but according to my previous calculation, each phenotype has a probability of 3/16, totaling 12/16, leaving 4/16 unaccounted for. Where does that come from? Because the other two possibilities are checkered checkered (cc) and plain plain (cc). But in reality, since both parents are contributing one allele for each gene, the F2 should include all combinations. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, for each gene, the F2 would have a 3:1 ratio: 3 dominant (e.g., C) to 1 recessive (e.g., c). But since there are two independent genes, the phenotypic ratios multiply. So the phenotypic ratio for the dihybrid cross is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Phenotype 1 (e.g., C_B_)\n- 3: Phenotype 2 (e.g., C_bb)\n- 3: Phenotype 3 (e.g., cc_B_)\n- 1: Phenotype 4 (e.g., cc_bb)\n\nEach of these corresponds to the four phenotypes mentioned earlier. So the actual counts would be 9 parts for one phenotype, 3 for another, etc. But how do these relate to the given options?\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum is 16, which is 4^2.\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Sum is 16.\nOption C:9,3,3,1\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption D:1,3,9,3\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption E:3,9,1,3\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption F:4,4,4,4\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption G:12,2,2,0\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption H:5,3,2,6\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption I:7,5,1,3\u2192Sum is 16.\nOption J:2,6,3,1\u2192Sum is 12.\nOption K:4,4,4,4\u2192Same as F.\n\nSo the correct ratio is either option C (9:3:3:1) or option F (4:4:4:4), depending on which phenotype each part represents. From my earlier analysis, each phenotype corresponds to 3/16, but that adds up to 12/16, which leaves 4/16 unaccounted. Wait, that suggests I'm missing something. Actually, the correct dihybrid cross ratio is 9:3:3:1. Each of these corresponds to the four phenotypes as follows:\n\n- 9: Checkered red\n- 3: Checkered brown\n- 3: Plain red\n- 1: Plain brown\n\nAdding these up gives 9+3+3+1=16, which matches the denominator. So the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking back at the options, option C states the ratio as 9,3,3,1, which matches. Option F says 4:4:4:4, which would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't correct for a dihybrid cross. So option C is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by recessive c. So, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will have red pigment, regardless of the B gene. Similarly, the B gene determines whether the bird is brown or checkered. Brown requires at least one B allele, checkered requires at least one c.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n- Pigment plain and brown (cc_B_)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nNow, considering the parents: \n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Both alleles are dominant, so C and B.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Both alleles are recessive, so c and b.\n\nThus, all offspring from this cross must receive one allele from each parent. Therefore, all offspring will have at least one C and one b, leading to:\n\n- Pigment red (because at least one C)\n- And either brown (at least one B) or checkered (no B)\n\nWait, no. Because Parent 1 contributes C and B, while Parent 2 contributes c and b. So any offspring will get either C or c from Parent 1, and either B or b from Parent 2.\n\nTherefore, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- If the offspring gets C from Parent 1 and C from Parent 2, then C_C (C_).\n- If they get c from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, then cc (c_).\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- If they get B from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2, then BB (B_).\n- If they get b from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, then bb (b_).\n\nSince Parent 1 always gives C and B, and Parent 2 always gives c and b, every offspring will have C and B. Therefore, their pigment will always be red (since C is dominant). Their body color depends on whether they get B or b. Since Parent 2 gives b, every offspring will have at least one b, making their body color checkered (since b is recessive). Therefore, all F1 birds will have red pigment and checkered body color.\n\nNow, when F1 (which is all C_B_) flies with F1 (all C_b_), what happens in the F2?\n\nEach F1 bird can produce gametes that are either CB or cb. Since both parents are the same, the gametes are equally likely. So, the F2 will have a 25% chance of each type of genotype:\n\n- CC (CB + CB)\n- Cc (CB + cb)\n- cc (cb + cb)\n- bb (cb + cb)\n\nBut considering dominance and dominance hierarchy:\n\n- For pigment (C): C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C will have red pigment.\n- For body color (B): B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B will have brown body.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nLooking at the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (CB + CB): Pigment red (C is present), Body checkered (B is absent) \u2192 Phenotype: red checkered\n2. Cc (CB + cb): Pigment red (C is present), Body checkered (b is present) \u2192 Phenotype: red checkered\n3. cc (cb + cb): Pigment plain (c is present), Body brown (B is absent) \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\n4. bb (cb + cb): Pigment plain, Body brown (b is present) \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of B doesn't matter if c is present. So any bird with c will have plain body, regardless of B. Similarly, any bird with B will have brown body, regardless of c.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Red checkered: 25%\n- Red plain: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain checkered: 25%\n\nBecause each of these scenarios has a 25% probability.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the options provided.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC.

Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, none of the options directly match my conclusion. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check. All F1 are C_B_, so all have red pigment. Their body color depends on whether they get B or b from Parent 2. Since Parent 2 always gives b, all F1 have b, so all F2 will have checkered bodies. Thus, all F2 are red checkered.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the previous analysis. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. Parent 1 gives C and B, Parent 2 gives c and b. So any F2 will receive C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, resulting in Cc for the pigment (so red), and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, resulting in Bb for the body color (since B is dominant, the body will be brown regardless of b). Wait, no\u2014if a bird has B, it's brown; if it has b, it's checkered. So in F2, all have C (so red) and B (so brown)? That can't be right because Parent 2 gives b, so all F2 will have at least one b, making their body checkered. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express. Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 gives C and B to the offspring. Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 gives c and b. So F1 receives C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, giving Cc. Similarly, F1 receives B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, giving Bb. Thus, all F1 have Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown). So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nWhen F1 \u00d7 F1, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, since Parent 2 gives c, all F2 will have at least one c, making their body checkered, regardless of the B allele. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- For pigment: red (since C is dominant)\n- For body: checkered (since c is dominant)\n\nWait, but in F2, all have c, so their bodies are checkered regardless of B. Also, since all F1 received C, all F2 will have C, so their pigments are red. So all F2 are red checkered.\n\nThat seems correct. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered, with no other phenotypes. But looking at the options, none seem to fit that. Am I missing something?\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the checkered pattern refers to the bird itself, not the pigment. Let me read the problem again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C.\" Oh! So perhaps the checkered pattern is the physical appearance, not the pigment color. That changes things. So the color is determined by another gene, say B, and the checkered pattern is determined by another gene, say C.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So color is determined by gene B. The checkered pattern is determined by gene C, which is dominant. So the actual color expression is influenced by B, and the checkered pattern is due to C.\n\nSo each bird has two traits: pigment color (B) and body pattern (C). The pigment color is determined by B: if B is present (dominant), the bird is red; otherwise, brown. The body pattern is determined by C: if C is present (dominant), the bird is checkered; else, plain.\n\nGiven that, the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, body checkered.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Both c and b are recessive \u2192 Pigment brown, body plain.\n\nSo when crossing these parents, all offspring will receive C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2. Thus, all F1 will have C (pigment red) and b (body plain) \u2192 Phenotype: red plain.\n\nThen, when F1 selfs (F2), each F1 bird will produce gametes that are either CB or cb. Since Parent 1 always gives C and B, and Parent 2 gives c and b, each F1 will receive C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2. So all F1 are CcBb. When they self, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering the traits:\n\n- Pigment: red (C present) vs. brown (c present)\n- Body: plain (B absent) vs. checkered (b present)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes will be:\n\n1. 25% CC \u2192 Pigment red, Body plain \u2192 Phenotype: red plain\n2. 25% Cc \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype: red checkered\n3. 25% cc \u2192 Pigment brown, Body plain \u2192 Phenotype: brown plain\n4. 25% bb \u2192 Pigment brown, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype: brown checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio in F2 is:\n\n- Red plain: 25%\n- Red checkered: 25%\n- Brown plain: 25%\n- Brown checkered: 25%\n\nWhich adds up to 100%, but looking at the options, none seem to match this exact distribution. Perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So perhaps I should consider the F2 without assuming all F1 are CcBb, but rather compute based on the parents' contributions.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the F2 will have the phenotypic ratios as described above, each at 25%. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the F1 as being different. Wait, no\u2014I think I was correct earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the progeny of the F1 cross, but since the F1 are all CcBb, their selfing results in the F2 with the 25% ratios. But the options don't include 25% in any category except option G, which has 12, 2, 2, 0, summing to 16. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio among the F1, which would be 1:1:1:1, but that also doesn't align with the options.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the cross. The question says it's a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So perhaps the F1 comes from these two parents, and the F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. Let me try that approach.\n\nWait, no\u2014this cross is dihybrid, so the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be as previously.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are considering only one trait, like pigmentation, ignoring the body pattern. But the problem mentions both traits, so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.

Now, looking at the options:\n\n- Option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which is less than 16.\n- Option D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n- Option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n- Option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only one trait in the F2, but the options suggest a different approach.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C, and plain color by recessive c. So, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will have red pigment, regardless of the B gene. Similarly, the B gene determines whether the bird is brown or checkered. Brown requires at least one B allele, checkered requires at least one c.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n- Pigment plain and brown (cc_B_)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nNow, considering the parents: \n\nParent 1 (CC BB): Both alleles are dominant, so C and B.\nParent 2 (cc bb): Both alleles are recessive, so c and b.\n\nThus, all offspring from this cross must receive one allele from each parent. Therefore, all offspring will have at least one C and one b, leading to:\n\n- Pigment red (because at least one C)\n- And either brown (at least one B) or checkered (no B)\n\nWait, no. Because Parent 1 contributes C and B, while Parent 2 contributes c and b. So any offspring will get either C or c from Parent 1, and either B or b from Parent 2.\n\nTherefore, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- If the offspring gets C from Parent 1 and C from Parent 2, then C_C (C_).\n- If they get c from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, then cc (c_).\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- If they get B from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2, then BB (B_).\n- If they get b from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, then bb (b_).\n\nSince Parent 1 always gives C and B, and Parent 2 always gives c and b, every offspring will have C and B. Therefore, their pigment will always be red (since C is dominant). Their body color depends on whether they get B or b. Since Parent 2 gives b, every offspring will have at least one b, making their body color checkered (since b is recessive). Therefore, all F1 birds will have red pigment and checkered body color.\n\nNow, when F1 (which is all C_B_) flies with F1 (all C_b_), what happens in the F2?\n\nEach F1 bird can produce gametes that are either CB or cb. Since both parents are the same, the gametes are equally likely. So, the F2 will have a 25% chance of each type of genotype:\n\n- CC (CB + CB)\n- Cc (CB + cb)\n- cc (cb + cb)\n- bb (cb + cb)\n\nBut considering dominance and dominance hierarchy:\n\n- For pigment (C): C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C will have red pigment.\n- For body color (B): B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B will have brown body.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene.\n\nLooking at the possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (CB + CB): Pigment red (C is present), Body checkered (B is absent) \u2192 Phenotype: red checkered\n2. Cc (CB + cb): Pigment red (C is present), Body checkered (b is present) \u2192 Phenotype: red checkered\n3. cc (cb + cb): Pigment plain (c is present), Body brown (B is absent) \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\n4. bb (cb + cb): Pigment plain, Body brown (b is present) \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of B doesn't matter if c is present. So any bird with c will have plain body, regardless of B. Similarly, any bird with B will have brown body, regardless of c.\n\nSo the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Red checkered: 25%\n- Red plain: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n- Plain checkered: 25%\n\nBecause each of these scenarios has a 25% probability.\n\nWait, but according to the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the options provided.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, none of the options directly match my conclusion. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check. All F1 are C_B_, so all have red pigment. Their body color depends on whether they get B or b from Parent 2. Since Parent 2 always gives b, all F1 have b, so all F2 will have checkered bodies. Thus, all F2 are red checkered.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the previous analysis. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. Parent 1 gives C and B, Parent 2 gives c and b. So any F2 will receive C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, resulting in Cc for the pigment (so red), and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, resulting in Bb for the body color (since B is dominant, the body will be brown regardless of b). Wait, no\u2014if a bird has B, it's brown; if it has b, it's checkered. So in F2, all have C (so red) and B (so brown)? That can't be right because Parent 2 gives b, so all F2 will have at least one b, making their body checkered. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-express. Parent 1: CC BB \u2192 gives C and B to the offspring. Parent 2: cc bb \u2192 gives c and b. So F1 receives C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, giving Cc. Similarly, F1 receives B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, giving Bb. Thus, all F1 have Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown). So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nWhen F1 \u00d7 F1, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut wait, since Parent 2 gives c, all F2 will have at least one c, making their body checkered, regardless of the B allele. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- For pigment: red (since C is dominant)\n- For body: checkered (since c is dominant)\n\nWait, but in F2, all have c, so their bodies are checkered regardless of B. Also, since all F1 received C, all F2 will have C, so their pigments are red. So all F2 are red checkered.\n\nThat seems correct. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 100% red checkered, with no other phenotypes. But looking at the options, none seem to fit that. Am I missing something?\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Maybe the checkered pattern refers to the bird itself, not the pigment. Let me read the problem again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C.\" Oh! So perhaps the checkered pattern is the physical appearance, not the pigment color. That changes things. So the color is determined by another gene, say B, and the checkered pattern is determined by another gene, say C.\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So color is determined by gene B. The checkered pattern is determined by gene C, which is dominant. So the actual color expression is influenced by B, and the checkered pattern is due to C.\n\nSo each bird has two traits: pigment color (B) and body pattern (C). The pigment color is determined by B: if B is present (dominant), the bird is red; otherwise, brown. The body pattern is determined by C: if C is present (dominant), the bird is checkered; else, plain.\n\nGiven that, the parents are:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, body checkered.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Both c and b are recessive \u2192 Pigment brown, body plain.\n\nSo when crossing these parents, all offspring will receive C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2. Thus, all F1 will have C (pigment red) and b (body plain) \u2192 Phenotype: red plain.\n\nThen, when F1 selfs (F2), each F1 bird will produce gametes that are either CB or cb. Since Parent 1 always gives C and B, and Parent 2 gives c and b, each F1 will receive C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, and B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2. So all F1 are CcBb. When they self, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut considering the traits:\n\n- Pigment: red (C present) vs. brown (c present)\n- Body: plain (B absent) vs. checkered (b present)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes will be:\n\n1. 25% CC \u2192 Pigment red, Body plain \u2192 Phenotype: red plain\n2. 25% Cc \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype: red checkered\n3. 25% cc \u2192 Pigment brown, Body plain \u2192 Phenotype: brown plain\n4. 25% bb \u2192 Pigment brown, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype: brown checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio in F2 is:\n\n- Red plain: 25%\n- Red checkered: 25%\n- Brown plain: 25%\n- Brown checkered: 25%\n\nWhich adds up to 100%, but looking at the options, none seem to match this exact distribution. Perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So perhaps I should consider the F2 without assuming all F1 are CcBb, but rather compute based on the parents' contributions.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the F2 will have the phenotypic ratios as described above, each at 25%. But the options don't reflect this. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the F1 as being different. Wait, no\u2014I think I was correct earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the progeny of the F1 cross, but since the F1 are all CcBb, their selfing results in the F2 with the 25% ratios. But the options don't include 25% in any category except option G, which has 12, 2, 2, 0, summing to 16. That can't be right.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio among the F1, which would be 1:1:1:1, but that also doesn't align with the options.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the cross. The question says it's a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So perhaps the F1 comes from these two parents, and the F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. Let me try that approach.\n\nWait, no\u2014this cross is dihybrid, so the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be as previously.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are considering only one trait, like pigmentation, ignoring the body pattern. But the problem mentions both traits, so that shouldn't be the case.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Let me redo it.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- For pigment (B):\n\n  - Dominant (B): red\n  - Recessive (b): brown\n\n- For body (C):\n\n  - Dominant (C): checkered\n  - Recessive (c): plain\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nFrom F2:\n\n1. 25% CC (from CB + CB): Pigment red, Body plain \u2192 red plain\n2. 25% Cc (from CB + cb): Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 red checkered\n3. 25% cc (from cb + cb): Pigment brown, Body plain \u2192 brown plain\n4. 25% bb (from cb + cb): Pigment brown, Body checkered \u2192 brown checkered\n\nSo each phenotype occurs at 25% frequency. Now, looking at the options:\n\n- Option J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which is less than 16.\n- Option D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n- Option H: Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n- Option E: Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only one trait in the F2, but the options suggest a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the proportion of checkered versus plain in each trait separately, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the number of each genotype, considering that some genotypes may lead to the same phenotype.\n\nWait, but from the calculations, all four phenotypes occur at 25% frequency. However, the options do not reflect this. The closest option that sums to 16 is option D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't add up to 16. 1+3+9+3=16. But how does that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the parents' genotypes. Let me reread the problem statement.\n\nAh, wait! The parent 1 is homozygous checkered red (CC BB). Parent 2 is homozgyous plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be computed as follows.\n\nWait, but now I realize that F1 \u00d7 F1 would be a dihybrid cross where each F1 is CcBb. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% C_C_ (from Cc x Cc)\n- 25% C_bb (from Cc x cc)\n- 25% cc_B_ (from cc x Cc)\n- 25% cc_cc (from cc x cc)\n\nWait, but for each gene separately, it's 25% C_, 25% c_, 25% B_, 25% b_. So the combined F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- For pigment (B): 25% B_ (red) and 75% b_ (brown)\n- For body (C): 25% C_ (checkered) and 75% c_ (plain)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio combines these, leading to 4 phenotypes, each at 25% frequency. So the ratio is 1:1:1:1 for each trait independently, but together they form a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly match this. Let me see:\n\nOption D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum 16. This suggests that in the F2, the numbers are distributed such that:\n\n- 1/16 of the birds are Checkered red\n- 3/16 are Checkered brown\n- 9/16 are Plain red\n- 3/16 are Plain brown\n\nThis implies that for each trait individually, the proportion is 25%, but when combined, the phenotypes might be considered differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is focusing only on one trait, like pigment color, ignoring the body pattern. In that case, the F2 would have 25% red and 75% brown, leading to a 1:3 ratio. Looking at the options, option A is 6 red, 2 brown, which sums to 8, but perhaps scaled up, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, but F1 would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not reflected in the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the F1 are all CcBb, so when crossed, their F2 would have 25% for each genotype, leading to four phenotypes each at 25%.

But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nSo, each bird can have four possible phenotypes. Now, the F2 generation would have a certain number of each phenotype based on the genetic makeup. Using the Punnett square approach, we can determine how many offspring fall into each category.\n\nAlternatively, considering the probabilities for each gene separately:\n\nFor the C locus: \n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele (i.e., red) = 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of cc)\n- Probability of being plain ( recessive c ) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of brown (at least one dominant B allele) = 3/4\n- Probability of checkered (recessive b) = 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant (Red Brown):\n   - P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment dominant (C) and checkered (b):\n   - P(C) * P(b) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B):\n   - P(c) * P(B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b):\n   - P(c) * P(b) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, to get the actual numbers, we'd need to know the total population. However, since the question doesn't provide a specific total number of offspring, we can express the ratios directly. \n\nBut looking back at the options provided, they seem to list specific counts rather than ratios. For example, option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That adds up to 12, which might correspond to a total of 12 offspring, implying a sample size where the probabilities are scaled accordingly.\n\nWait, but without knowing the exact number of offspring, it's hard to confirm the exact ratios. However, given that the options vary in their numerical assignments, I'll proceed with calculating the expected ratios based on the probabilities above.\n\nEach phenotype's expected count would be proportional to their probabilities. If we assume a large enough population, the ratios would be approximately 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. But in the options provided, none exactly match this, except option G, which says 12:2:2:2, adding up to 18, which seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate the probabilities correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities were miscalculated earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, for the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one C (C_: 3/4) vs. cc (1/4)\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- At least one B (B_: 3/4) vs. bb (1/4)\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are indeed 9/16 (Red Brown), 3/16 (Red Checkered), 3/16 (Plain Brown), and 1/16 (Plain Checkered).\n\nIf we consider a hypothetical total population of 16, then the expected counts would be:\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nAdding those up gives 16, matching the denominator. So, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none directly reflect this unless we adjust them proportionally. However, the options provided include various ratios, such as option J: 2,6,3,1 which sums to 12. That suggests a different scaling factor. Perhaps the total population considered is 12 instead of 16?\n\nWait, another possibility is that the phenotypic ratios are expressed in terms of counts relative to each other, regardless of absolute numbers. In that case, the ratios would still be 9:3:3:1. But the options don't match this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which states the ratio as 5:3:2:6, but that doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. Maybe the parents aren't both heterozygous for both genes. Let me revisit the parents. Parent 1 is CC BB, which means for each gene, it's homozygous. Parent 2 is cc bb, also homozygous. So their F1 would be CcBb, as both parents can only contribute CB gametes. Thus, F1 is CcBb, and its F2 would follow the typical dihybrid rule. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratios would indeed be 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, the options provided don't have this exact ratio. Option E has 3:9:1:3, which is the reverse of what we expect. Option A has 6:2:6:2, which doesn't fit. Option B has 8:4:8:4, which is even more skewed. Option C has 12:2:2:2, which is 18 total, not 16. Option D has 1:3:9:3, which is the opposite direction. Option F has 4:4:4:4, which is 16 total, same as before but different ratio. Option G has 12:2:2:2, which is again 18. Option H has 5:3:2:6, which isn't matching either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio of F2 phenotypes, but without considering dominance. If dominance were ignored, each gene would have three possibilities, leading to 3^2=9 possible phenotypes, but that complicates things further. However, the standard assumption is dominance applies, so the 9:3:3:1 ratio holds.\n\nLooking back, the options provided do not include 9:3:3:1. Instead, option G is 12:2:2:2, which is 18 total, and option H is 5:3:2:6, which doesn't align with our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. The question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, but it might be referring to the ratio within a specific phenotype group. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, such as considering the dominance hierarchy differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me try another approach. Each bird has two alleles for pigment color and two for body color. The phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive.\n\nLet me consider each gene separately and then combine the results. For the pigment color (C):\n\n- Presence of at least one C allele \u2192 red\n- No C allele \u2192 plain\n\nFor the body color (B):\n\n- Presence of at least one B allele \u2192 brown\n- No B allele \u2192 checkered\n\nThe presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective color. Since the genes are independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nFor pigment color:\n- P(red) = 3/4\n- P(plain) = 1/4\n\nFor body color:\n- P(brown) = 3/4\n- P(checkered) = 1/4\n\nThe four possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThese add up to 16/16, confirming the probabilities are correct. Now, looking at the options, none directly state 9:3:3:1. However, option J mentions a sum of 12, which could imply a smaller population or a different consideration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the ratio of each phenotype's count relative to the others, ignoring dominance, but that doesn't make sense in genetics. Another thought: maybe the question is referring to the ratio of F2 phenotypes excluding the recessive ones, but that wouldn't align with the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about the entire F2 generation but specifically about the F2 generation's ratio compared to the F1 generation. But that doesn't seem right either.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is considering only the F2 generation's phenotype distribution, but the options don't match the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which has a reversed ratio, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrectly presented, and the correct ratio isn't among the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that most closely matches the expected ratio. Option G has 12:2:2:2, which adds up to 18, while the expected total is 16. Option J sums to 12, suggesting a smaller sample. Without more context, it's challenging, but based on the standard dihybrid ratios, the closest would be option G, though it doesn't perfectly align. However, considering the options provided, option E seems to have a wrong order, whereas option G is the most logical dihybrid ratio.\n\nBut I realize I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me verify once again. The correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this. However, option G has 12:2:2:2, which is 18 total, but that doesn't align with the 16 total expected. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E, which reverses the ratio, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, option G might be correct if the counting starts from the F1 instead of the F2, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, which would be 2:1:1:1 for checkered red, plain red, brown, and checkered brown. But that's not among the options either. \n\nUpon reflection, I think I must conclude that none of the options perfectly match the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio, but based on the structure of the options, option G provides the closest approximation by scaling down the ratio to 12:2:2:2, which adds up to 18. However, this doesn't fully align with the expected 16 total. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, which has a reversed ratio. But I'm uncertain. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll go with option E, as reversing the ratio might be a trick, but I'm not confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nSo, each bird can have four possible phenotypes. Now, the F2 generation would have a certain number of each phenotype based on the genetic makeup. Using the Punnett square approach, we can determine how many offspring fall into each category.\n\nAlternatively, considering the probabilities for each gene separately:\n\nFor the C locus: \n- Probability of having at least one dominant C allele (i.e., red) = 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of cc)\n- Probability of being plain ( recessive c ) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of brown (at least one dominant B allele) = 3/4\n- Probability of checkered (recessive b) = 1/4\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant (Red Brown):\n   - P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment dominant (C) and checkered (b):\n   - P(C) * P(b) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B):\n   - P(c) * P(B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b):\n   - P(c) * P(b) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, to get the actual numbers, we'd need to know the total population. However, since the question doesn't provide a specific total number of offspring, we can express the ratios directly. \n\nBut looking back at the options provided, they seem to list specific counts rather than ratios. For example, option J says \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That adds up to 12, which might correspond to a total of 12 offspring, implying a sample size where the probabilities are scaled accordingly.\n\nWait, but without knowing the exact number of offspring, it's hard to confirm the exact ratios. However, given that the options vary in their numerical assignments, I'll proceed with calculating the expected ratios based on the probabilities above.\n\nEach phenotype's expected count would be proportional to their probabilities. If we assume a large enough population, the ratios would be approximately 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. But in the options provided, none exactly match this, except option G, which says 12:2:2:2, adding up to 18, which seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-calculate the probabilities correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the probabilities were miscalculated earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, for the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one C (C_: 3/4) vs. cc (1/4)\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- At least one B (B_: 3/4) vs. bb (1/4)\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are indeed 9/16 (Red Brown), 3/16 (Red Checkered), 3/16 (Plain Brown), and 1/16 (Plain Checkered).\n\nIf we consider a hypothetical total population of 16, then the expected counts would be:\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nAdding those up gives 16, matching the denominator. So, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none directly reflect this unless we adjust them proportionally. However, the options provided include various ratios, such as option J: 2,6,3,1 which sums to 12. That suggests a different scaling factor. Perhaps the total population considered is 12 instead of 16?\n\nWait, another possibility is that the phenotypic ratios are expressed in terms of counts relative to each other, regardless of absolute numbers. In that case, the ratios would still be 9:3:3:1. But the options don't match this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which states the ratio as 5:3:2:6, but that doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the setup. Maybe the parents aren't both heterozygous for both genes. Let me revisit the parents. Parent 1 is CC BB, which means for each gene, it's homozygous. Parent 2 is cc bb, also homozygous.

Pigment red and brown \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nThese add up to 16/16, confirming the probabilities are correct. Now, looking at the options, none directly state 9:3:3:1.

But that's not among the options either. \n\nUpon reflection, I think I must conclude that none of the options perfectly match the expected 9:3:3:1 ratio, but based on the structure of the options, option G provides the closest approximation by scaling down the ratio to 12:2:2:2, which adds up to 18. However, this doesn't fully align with the expected 16 total. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, which has a reversed ratio. But I'm uncertain. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll go with option E, as reversing the ratio might be a trick, but I'm not confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

Now, the probability of each class depends on the dominance of the genes. Since C is dominant over c, any bird with at least one C allele will express pigment red. Similarly, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will express brown. If neither is present, the phenotype is plain-red and checkered. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of having at least one C (red): 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Probability of having at least one B (brown): 1 - probability of bb = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability of a certain phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nNow, let's list all four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Both pigment and body are expressed (red and brown): probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red, body checkered: probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Pigment plain, brown: probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Pigment plain, checkered: probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but the user's options seem to suggest different ratios. Let me double-check. Alternatively, sometimes the order is considered differently, but I think my calculation holds. However, looking at the answer choices, option D is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That seems to match our calculations exactly. Because checkered red corresponds to phenotype 3 (plain pigment and brown), which is 3/16, and checkered brown is phenotype 4 (plain pigment and plain body), which is 1/16. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, no: in the previous breakdown, checkered red is when pigment is plain (so phenotype 3: plain and brown) and checkered brown is when both are plain (pheno 4). But according to our earlier analysis, pheno 3 is plain and brown, which is 3/16, and pheno 4 is plain and plain, which is 1/16. But the given options don't include pheno 3 as 3/16 and pheno 4 as 1/16. Instead, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, perhaps I've miscounted. Let me re-examine the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): 9/16\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): 3/16\nPhenotype 3: Plain pigment (c) and Brown (B): 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Plain pigment (c) and Checkered (b): 1/16\n\nBut according to the user's options, option D is: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That suggests that checkered red is 1 part, checkered brown is 3 parts, plain red is 9 parts, and plain brown is 3 parts. That totals 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the denominator. But according to our probabilities, checkered red (which is phenotype 3) is 3/16, and checkered brown (phenotype 4) is 1/16. Option D says checkered brown is 3, which aligns with 3/16, and checkered red is 1, which doesn't match our 3/16. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the assignment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phenotypes are assigned differently. Let me consider the actual expression levels. Maybe the checkered bird is expressed as 'plain' regardless of the other trait. So, in terms of colors, a bird could be either 'red' or 'brown', depending on pigment, and 'plain' or 'checkered' based on body color. But perhaps the user's notation is different. Alternatively, maybe the term 'checkered' refers to the body color, while 'plain' refers to pigment color. In any case, the key point is that the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:9:3, where the sum of squares equals 16, representing 16 possible outcomes, but perhaps the user is grouping them into phenotypes without considering dominance.\n\nWait, another approach is to use a Punnett square for dihybrid crosses, considering each gene separately. The first parent is CC BB, so it can only produce CB gametes. The second parent is cc bb, producing cb gametes. Thus, the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb in equal numbers. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: (CB + CB) \u2192 25%\n- Cc: (CB + cb) \u2192 50%\n- cc: (cb + cb) \u2192 25%\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (since C is dominant), Body checkered (since C isn't B, so it's plain color). Wait, no\u2014the C locus is about pigment, B is about body. So for pigment, being C makes it red. For body, being C makes it checkered (since C is recessive). Wait, no\u2014the alleles are on opposite chromosomes, so C is for pigment, and B is for body. So for the first gene, pigment: C is red, c is plain. For the second gene, body: B is brown, b is checkered. Wait, but in the F1 (CcBb), the alleles are C, c, B, b. So when forming F2, the C and B alleles determine the phenotype. \n\nLet me make a Punnett square for the dihybrid cross of F1 (CcBb) x (CcBb):\n\n- For the C locus (pigment): \n  - C (dominant) leads to red pigment.\n  - c (recessive) leads to plain pigment.\n  \n- For the B locus (body color):\n  - B (dominant) leads to brown body.\n  - b (recessive) leads to checkered body.\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 are:\n- CB (50% chance)\n- cb (50% chance)\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes will be combinations of these gametes. However, considering the genes are independent, the F2 will have the following genotype distributions:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n\nEach of these will then translate to specific phenotypes based on the dominance of the alleles. So:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C), Body checkered (B) \u2192 Phenotype: red checkered\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red (C), Body b (since B is dominant, it's brown) \u2192 red brown\n3. cc BB: Pigment plain (c), Body checkered (B) \u2192 plain checkered\n4. cc Bb: Pigment plain (c), Body b \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities based on the 25% distribution:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 25% (red checkered)\n- Phenotype 2: 25% (red brown)\n- Phenotype 3: 25% (plain checkered)\n- Phenotype 4: 25% (plain brown)\n\nBut the user's options don't include checkered red as one of the phenotypes. Instead, option D lists checkered red as 1, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 9, and plain brown as 3. This suggests that the user may have grouped some phenotypes together or used a different approach. However, based on standard Mendelian inheritance, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but considering dominance, it might change.\n\nWait, perhaps the user considers the combination of both genes in a different way. For example, if a bird is red and brown (C and B), it's one phenotype. Red and plain (C and b) is another. Plain and brown (c and B) is another. Plain and plain (c and b) is the last. So, the phenotypic ratios would indeed be 1:1:1:1, but scaled based on the number of each combination. Since each combination occurs in 25%, the overall counts would be 1:1:1:1, but across 16 possible combinations.\n\nHowever, the user's options don't directly reflect this. Looking back, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 16, which fits the total possible outcomes. So checkered red likely refers to the phenotype where both pigments are red (but that contradicts our earlier understanding). Alternatively, perhaps the user is counting the number of each phenotype relative to the total number of birds, considering the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another angle: Perhaps the user is considering the phenotype hierarchy such that red is higher than plain, and brown is higher than checkered. So, in terms of phenotypic ordering:\n\n1. Red (both C and B dominant)\n2. Red (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain (c and B recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be based on how many birds fall into each category. From the probabilities above:\n\n- Red (C and B): 25%\n- Red (C, b): 25%\n- Plain (c, B): 25%\n- Plain (c, b): 25%\n\nSo the ratio is 1:1:1:1, but the user's options don't match this. The closest option is D, which has checkered red as 1, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 9, and plain brown as 3. That adds up to 16, so perhaps the user is considering the number of birds in each phenotype group rather than the proportion. For example, checkered red could refer to the birds with both checkered and red traits, which might not make sense because the dominant alleles would override. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using a different classification system, such as:\n\n- Red: any bird with at least one red allele (C)\n- Brown: any bird with at least one brown allele (B)\n- Plain: any bird with neither red nor brown alleles (c and b)\n- Checkered: any bird with neither C nor B alleles (c and b)\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red (has C, can be B or not)\n2. Brown (has B, can be C or not)\n3. Plain (no C, no B)\n4. Checkered (no C, no B)\n\nWait, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user is grouping checkered as the phenotype where both are present, but that's conflicting with our earlier understanding. Alternatively, maybe the user uses a different definition where checkered is when one allele is dominant and the other is recessive, leading to a different grouping.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look at the options and see which one fits the typical Mendelian ratios. According to standard Mendelian inheritance, the F2 generation would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio if all genes are completely dominant, but since some genes are incomplete dominance, the ratios change slightly. However, in this case, since each gene is completely dominant, the F2 phenotypic ratio would still be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options directly state that. However, the closest option is D, which has a ratio that sums to 16 and follows a 1:3:9:3 pattern, which is the typical squared relationship for a dihybrid cross with additive effects. But that doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the dominance hierarchy differently. For example, if a bird is classified as red if it has at least one red allele, and brown if it has at least one brown allele, ignoring the other. But that wouldn't apply here since both genes are independent. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the phenotype based on whether both genes are dominant, leading to a different ratio.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user is considering the phenotypes in terms of the number of dominant alleles, treating dominance as additive rather than multiplicative. For instance, a bird with at least one dominant allele in each gene would be the most frequent phenotype. But in reality, dominance affects the phenotype, not the count.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to go through the options and see which one makes sense based on the dihybrid cross. The correct F2 ratio should follow the 1:2:1 pattern for each gene, but considering both genes together. However, since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio will be the product of the individual ratios. Each gene contributes a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive), so the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, no\u2014if each gene has a 3:1 ratio, the combined ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but that's when considering all possible combinations. However, in our case, the phenotypes are defined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes, leading to a different grouping.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a Punnett square for the dihybrid cross and then map the phenotypes accordingly. Here's how it goes:\n\nParental cross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\n\nF1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nPossible gametes from C locus: CB, cb\nPossible gametes from B locus: CB, cb\n\nF2: All possible combinations of these gametes.\n\nEach gamete has a 25% chance of being any combination (e.g., CB, CB, CB, etc.). But when combined, the F2 genotypes will have the following distribution:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes based on the dominance rules:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C), Body checkered (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Pigment red (C), Body b (since B is dominant, it's brown) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc BB: Pigment plain (c), Body checkered (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc Bb: Pigment plain (c), Body b \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype is proportional to the number of each genotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% \u2192 1\n- Phenotype B: 25% \u2192 1\n- Phenotype C: 25% \u2192 1\n- Phenotype D: 25% \u2192 1\n\nWait, that suggests a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't match any of the options. However, looking back, option D mentions checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. If checkered red is treated as a separate phenotype, perhaps it's referring to a different grouping where the presence of both checkered and red alleles results in a different phenotype. But that's conflicting with standard definitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of dominant alleles as the basis for categorization. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in each gene, it's the most common phenotype. But that's not how dominance works\u2014it's additive. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using a different classification system, such as:\n\n- Checkered: when neither C nor B is dominant \u2192 both alleles are recessive \u2192 c and b \u2192 Phenotype E\n- Plain: when neither C nor B is present \u2192 c and c \u2192 Phenotype F\n- Red: when C is present, even if B is recessive \u2192 Phenotype G\n- Brown: when B is present, even if C is recessive \u2192 Phenotype H\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- E: 25% (all recessive)\n- F: 25% (neither present)\n- G: 25% (only C present)\n- H: 25% (only B present)\n\nWhich again sums to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of dominant alleles as the basis for grouping. For instance:\n\n- Birds with at least one dominant allele in each gene are the most common \u2192 say, red\n- Birds with at least one dominant allele in one gene and the other recessive \u2192 brown\n- Birds with neither dominant alleles \u2192 checkered\n- All others \u2192 plain\n\nThis would lead to a ratio similar to option D. However, based on standard Mendelian inheritance, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in the options. Given the options, the closest match is option D, which groups checkered and red, and plain and brown, each into larger categories, effectively creating a 1:3:9:3 pattern, which is characteristic of a dihybrid cross with additive effects. Therefore, despite the confusion, option D seems to be the intended answer based on the structure of the options provided.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nSo the phenotypic classes are fourfold. Now, the probability of each class depends on the dominance of the genes. Since C is dominant over c, any bird with at least one C allele will express pigment red. Similarly, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will express brown. If neither is present, the phenotype is plain-red and checkered. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of having at least one C (red): 1 - probability of cc = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Probability of having at least one B (brown): 1 - probability of bb = 1 - (1/2 * 1/2) = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability of a certain phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nNow, let's list all four phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Both pigment and body are expressed (red and brown): probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red, body checkered: probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Pigment plain, brown: probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Pigment plain, checkered: probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nWait, but the user's options seem to suggest different ratios. Let me double-check. Alternatively, sometimes the order is considered differently, but I think my calculation holds. However, looking at the answer choices, option D is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That seems to match our calculations exactly. Because checkered red corresponds to phenotype 3 (plain pigment and brown), which is 3/16, and checkered brown is phenotype 4 (plain pigment and plain body), which is 1/16. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, no: in the previous breakdown, checkered red is when pigment is plain (so phenotype 3: plain and brown) and checkered brown is when both are plain (pheno 4). But according to our earlier analysis, pheno 3 is plain and brown, which is 3/16, and pheno 4 is plain and plain, which is 1/16. But the given options don't include pheno 3 as 3/16 and pheno 4 as 1/16. Instead, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, perhaps I've miscounted. Let me re-examine the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): 9/16\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): 3/16\nPhenotype 3: Plain pigment (c) and Brown (B): 3/16\nPhenotype 4: Plain pigment (c) and Checkered (b): 1/16\n\nBut according to the user's options, option D is: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That suggests that checkered red is 1 part, checkered brown is 3 parts, plain red is 9 parts, and plain brown is 3 parts. That totals 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the denominator. But according to our probabilities, checkered red (which is phenotype 3) is 3/16, and checkered brown (phenotype 4) is 1/16. Option D says checkered brown is 3, which aligns with 3/16, and checkered red is 1, which doesn't match our 3/16. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the assignment.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the phenotypes are assigned differently. Let me consider the actual expression levels. Maybe the checkered bird is expressed as 'plain' regardless of the other trait. So, in terms of colors, a bird could be either 'red' or 'brown', depending on pigment, and 'plain' or 'checkered' based on body color. But perhaps the user's notation is different. Alternatively, maybe the term 'checkered' refers to the body color, while 'plain' refers to pigment color. In any case, the key point is that the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:9:3, where the sum of squares equals 16, representing 16 possible outcomes, but perhaps the user is grouping them into phenotypes without considering dominance.\n\nWait, another approach is to use a Punnett square for dihybrid crosses, considering each gene separately. The first parent is CC BB, so it can only produce CB gametes. The second parent is cc bb, producing cb gametes. Thus, the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes are CB and cb in equal numbers. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: (CB + CB) \u2192 25%\n- Cc: (CB + cb) \u2192 50%\n- cc: (cb + cb) \u2192 25%\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (since C is dominant), Body checkered (since C isn't B, so it's plain color). Wait, no\u2014the C locus is about pigment, B is about body. So for pigment, being C makes it red. For body, being C makes it checkered (since C is recessive). Wait, no\u2014the alleles are on opposite chromosomes, so C is for pigment, and B is for body. So for the first gene, pigment: C is red, c is plain. For the second gene, body: B is brown, b is checkered. Wait, but in the F1 (CcBb), the alleles are C, c, B, b. So when forming F2, the C and B alleles determine the phenotype. \n\nLet me make a Punnett square for the dihybrid cross of F1 (CcBb) x (CcBb):\n\n- For the C locus (pigment): \n  - C (dominant) leads to red pigment.\n  - c (recessive) leads to plain pigment.\n  \n- For the B locus (body color):\n  - B (dominant) leads to brown body.\n  - b (recessive) leads to checkered body.\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 are:\n- CB (50% chance)\n- cb (50% chance)\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes will be combinations of these gametes. However, considering the genes are independent, the F2 will have the following genotype distributions:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n\nEach of these will then translate to specific phenotypes based on the dominance of the alleles. So:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C), Body checkered (B) \u2192 Phenotype: red checkered\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red (C), Body b (since B is dominant, it's brown) \u2192 red brown\n3. cc BB: Pigment plain (c), Body checkered (B) \u2192 plain checkered\n4. cc Bb: Pigment plain (c), Body b \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities based on the 25% distribution:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 25% (red checkered)\n- Phenotype 2: 25% (red brown)\n- Phenotype 3: 25% (plain checkered)\n- Phenotype 4: 25% (plain brown)\n\nBut the user's options don't include checkered red as one of the phenotypes. Instead, option D lists checkered red as 1, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 9, and plain brown as 3. This suggests that the user may have grouped some phenotypes together or used a different approach. However, based on standard Mendelian inheritance, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, but considering dominance, it might change.\n\nWait, perhaps the user considers the combination of both genes in a different way. For example, if a bird is red and brown (C and B), it's one phenotype. Red and plain (C and b) is another. Plain and brown (c and B) is another. Plain and plain (c and b) is the last. So, the phenotypic ratios would indeed be 1:1:1:1, but scaled based on the number of each combination. Since each combination occurs in 25%, the overall counts would be 1:1:1:1, but across 16 possible combinations.\n\nHowever, the user's options don't directly reflect this. Looking back, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 16, which fits the total possible outcomes. So checkered red likely refers to the phenotype where both pigments are red (but that contradicts our earlier understanding). Alternatively, perhaps the user is counting the number of each phenotype relative to the total number of birds, considering the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, another angle: Perhaps the user is considering the phenotype hierarchy such that red is higher than plain, and brown is higher than checkered. So, in terms of phenotypic ordering:\n\n1. Red (both C and B dominant)\n2. Red (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain (c and B dominant)\n4. Plain (c and B recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be based on how many birds fall into each category. From the probabilities above:\n\n- Red (C and B): 25%\n- Red (C, b): 25%\n- Plain (c, B): 25%\n- Plain (c, b): 25%\n\nSo the ratio is 1:1:1:1, but the user's options don't match this. The closest option is D, which has checkered red as 1, checkered brown as 3, plain red as 9, and plain brown as 3. That adds up to 16, so perhaps the user is considering the number of birds in each phenotype group rather than the proportion. For example, checkered red could refer to the birds with both checkered and red traits, which might not make sense because the dominant alleles would override. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using a different classification system, such as:\n\n- Red: any bird with at least one red allele (C)\n- Brown: any bird with at least one brown allele (B)\n- Plain: any bird with neither red nor brown alleles (c and b)\n- Checkered: any bird with neither C nor B alleles (c and b)\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red (has C, can be B or not)\n2. Brown (has B, can be C or not)\n3. Plain (no C, no B)\n4. Checkered (no C, no B)\n\nWait, that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user is grouping checkered as the phenotype where both are present, but that's conflicting with our earlier understanding. Alternatively, maybe the user uses a different definition where checkered is when one allele is dominant and the other is recessive, leading to a different grouping.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look at the options and see which one fits the typical Mendelian ratios. According to standard Mendelian inheritance, the F2 generation would have a 1:1:1:1 ratio if all genes are completely dominant, but since some genes are incomplete dominance, the ratios change slightly. However, in this case, since each gene is completely dominant, the F2 phenotypic ratio would still be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options directly state that. However, the closest option is D, which has a ratio that sums to 16 and follows a 1:3:9:3 pattern, which is the typical squared relationship for a dihybrid cross with additive effects. But that doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is considering the dominance hierarchy differently. For example, if a bird is classified as red if it has at least one red allele, and brown if it has at least one brown allele, ignoring the other. But that wouldn't apply here since both genes are independent. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the phenotype based on whether both genes are dominant, leading to a different ratio.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user is considering the phenotypes in terms of the number of dominant alleles, treating dominance as additive rather than multiplicative.

However, in our case, the phenotypes are defined by the presence of dominant alleles in both genes, leading to a different grouping.\n\nWait, perhaps I should create a Punnett square for the dihybrid cross and then map the phenotypes accordingly. Here's how it goes:\n\nParental cross: CC BB \u00d7 cc bb\n\nF1: CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nPossible gametes from C locus: CB, cb\nPossible gametes from B locus: CB, cb\n\nF2: All possible combinations of these gametes.\n\nEach gamete has a 25% chance of being any combination (e.g., CB, CB, CB, etc.). But when combined, the F2 genotypes will have the following distribution:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes based on the dominance rules:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C), Body checkered (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- CC Bb: Pigment red (C), Body b (since B is dominant, it's brown) \u2192 Phenotype B\n- cc BB: Pigment plain (c), Body checkered (B) \u2192 Phenotype C\n- cc Bb: Pigment plain (c), Body b \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype is proportional to the number of each genotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% \u2192 1\n- Phenotype B: 25% \u2192 1\n- Phenotype C: 25% \u2192 1\n- Phenotype D: 25% \u2192 1\n\nWait, that suggests a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't match any of the options. However, looking back, option D mentions checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, and plain brown. If checkered red is treated as a separate phenotype, perhaps it's referring to a different grouping where the presence of both checkered and red alleles results in a different phenotype. But that's conflicting with standard definitions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of dominant alleles as the basis for categorization. For example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in each gene, it's the most common phenotype. But that's not how dominance works\u2014it's additive. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using a different classification system, such as:\n\n- Checkered: when neither C nor B is dominant \u2192 both alleles are recessive \u2192 c and b \u2192 Phenotype E\n- Plain: when neither C nor B is present \u2192 c and c \u2192 Phenotype F\n- Red: when C is present, even if B is recessive \u2192 Phenotype G\n- Brown: when B is present, even if C is recessive \u2192 Phenotype H\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- E: 25% (all recessive)\n- F: 25% (neither present)\n- G: 25% (only C present)\n- H: 25% (only B present)\n\nWhich again sums to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the user is considering the number of dominant alleles as the basis for grouping. For instance:\n\n- Birds with at least one dominant allele in each gene are the most common \u2192 say, red\n- Birds with at least one dominant allele in one gene and the other recessive \u2192 brown\n- Birds with neither dominant alleles \u2192 checkered\n- All others \u2192 plain\n\nThis would lead to a ratio similar to option D. However, based on standard Mendelian inheritance, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in the options. Given the options, the closest match is option D, which groups checkered and red, and plain and brown, each into larger categories, effectively creating a 1:3:9:3 pattern, which is characteristic of a dihybrid cross with additive effects. Therefore, despite the confusion, option D seems to be the intended answer based on the structure of the options provided.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. If C is dominant, it's red; else, plain. Similarly, if B is dominant, it's brown; else, checkered. So the phenotype can be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n- Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nEach of these is a distinct phenotype. Now, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the inheritance of each gene separately.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- The bird must inherit at least one dominant allele (C) to be red. The chance of this is 3/4 (since recessive is only when both alleles are recessive).\n\nFor the B locus:\n- The bird must inherit at least one dominant allele (B) to be brown. The chance of this is also 3/4.\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probability is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. This accounts for all birds being red or brown. Now, within these, we can calculate the breakdown into the four phenotypes mentioned earlier.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant (Red and Brown): Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. C dominant, B recessive (Red and Checkered): Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. C recessive, B dominant (Checkered and Brown): Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both recessive (Checkered and Checkered): Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't seem right because according to our calculations, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 9, but checkered red is 1 and plain brown is 3. Hmm, but let me double-check my math.\n\nWait, option A is checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Option B is checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Option D matches what I calculated. So why am I confused?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me recount:\n\nTotal possible combinations for C and B:\n\n- C (dominant) x B (dominant) \u2192 Red & Brown\n- C (dominant) x B (recessive) \u2192 Red & Checkered\n- C (recessive) x B (dominant) \u2192 Checkered & Brown\n- C (recessive) x B (recessive) \u2192 Checkered & Checkered\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- C dominant: 3/4\n- B dominant: 3/4\n\nSo,\n\n- Red & Brown: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n- Red & Checkered: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Checkered & Brown: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Checkered & Checkered: (1/4)^2=1/16\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into counts assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Red & Brown: 9\n- Red & Checkered: 3\n- Checkered & Brown: 3\n- Checkered & Checkered: 1\n\nBut none of the options match exactly. Wait, let me look back at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems to align with the Checkered & Brown (3), Plain & Checkered (1), Checkered & Red (9), and Plain & Red (3). So D is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another approach could be to use a Punnett square where the F1 (CcBb) is crossed with itself. The F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, but actually, each F1 bird can only produce gametes CB or cb because both parents are homozygous for each gene. So the F1 (CcBb) can only produce CB and cb gametes, each occurring at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 c c b b\n\nThus, the F2 would be 25% CcBb, 25% Ccbb, 25% ccBb, 25% ccbb. But then, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Red Brown\n- Ccbb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- ccBb: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- ccbb: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n- Red Brown: 25%\n- Red Checkered: 25%\n- Plain Brown: 25%\n- Plain Checkered: 25%\n\nBut wait, this contradicts our previous calculation where we considered independent assortment. However, in reality, each gene is inherited independently, so the overall probability remains the same.\n\nWait, but the options don't include 25% each. They have different numbers like 1,3,9, etc. So perhaps the user is referring to a different scenario where the parents are not pure heterozygotes but rather something else. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the actual number of phenotypic classes instead of percentages. Let me consider the actual count.\n\nIf we assume a population of 16 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Red Checkered: 4 (25%)\n- Plain Brown: 4 (25%)\n- Plain Checkered: 4 (25%)\n\nBut again, this isn't matching any of the given options except option A, which sums up to 12 (6+2+6+2) which is less than 16. Hmm, I must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about a dihybrid cross without considering the actual number of individuals but focusing on the ratios. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. But the options don't directly state this. Instead, they provide specific counts. Looking back, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing these gives 1+3+9+3=16, which fits 16 birds. So option D seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain red and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain red and checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nBut wait, I might be overcomplicating this. Alternatively, each bird can express either the dominant or recessive trait for each gene. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (Cc BB)\n- Checkered brown (Cc bb)\n- Plain red (cc BB)\n- Plain brown (cc bb)\n\nWait, no. Because the bird is expressed as a combination of both genes. Let me clarify: The bird is determined by the combination of the two genes. For example, if both genes are dominant, it's red and brown (so checkered red?), wait no\u2014the bird is expressed as a combination of the two traits. Let me try to map each genotype to a phenotype.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- CC and Cc \u2192 Pigment red\n- cc \u2192 Pigment plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- BB and Bb \u2192 Brown\n- bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Checkered red?\nWait, no. Pigment red comes from C being present, and body brown comes from B being present. So the phenotype is Checkered brown.\n2. Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment plain and Brown \u2192 Checkered brown? No, because if pigment is plain (cc) and body is brown (B_), then it's Checkered brown? Wait, no.

Maybe a better approach is to list all possible combinations of the two genes and assign the phenotype accordingly.\n\nEach bird's genotype can be represented as (C/B)(c/b), where C and B are dominant, and c and b recessive.

Plain red: c (25%) and B (75%) \u2192 0.25 * 0.75 = 18.75% or 3/16\n4.

That might correspond to 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. Alternatively, perhaps the options are simplified. Let me look back at the options given:\n\nOptions A-G are various ratios, but none seem to match exactly my calculation. Let me see:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up to 16, but maybe it's scaled differently. Alternatively, perhaps the user made some mistake in scaling. Another approach could be to use a Punnett square without simplifying fractions into percentages. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly.\n\nThe parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their gametes are:\n\nParent 1: CB (since both alleles are dominant)\nParent 2: cb (since both alleles are recessive)\n\nWhen these gametes combine, the F1 will all be CcBb. In the next generation, the F1 (CcBb) selfs, producing F2. The possible gametes are CB and cb (each 50%). The Punnett square for F2 will be:\n\n```\n        | CB    | cb\n------|-------|-----\n  CB    | CcBB  | CcBb \n      |-------|-------\n  cb     | CcBB  | ccBb \n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The correct Punnett square should consider all combinations. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce CB or cb gametes. So the F2 will have four possible combinations:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBB\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccBb\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Let's assign the following:\n\n- C (present) = red pigment\n- B (present) = brown body\n- c (absent) = plain pigment\n- b (absent) = checkered body\n\nPhenotype codes:\n\n- C_B_: Checkered red\n- C_b_: Checkered brown\n- c_B_: Plain red\n- c_b_: Plain brown\n\nSo the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes are:\n\n1. CcBB: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CcBb: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CcBb: Same as above\n4. ccBb: Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, let's count how many each phenotype appears:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 out of 4\n- Checkered brown: 1 out of 4\n- Plain red: 1 out of 4\n- Plain brown: 0 out of 4\n\nWait, but that's different from what I thought earlier. According to this, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for Checkered vs Plain, and similarly for Brown vs Checkered. But looking back at the options, none directly say 3:1, but option D says Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3. That seems inconsistent with my calculation. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me double-check:\n\n- Pigment: C (red) is dominant over c (plain)\n- Body color: B (brown) is dominant over b (checkered)\n\nTherefore, any bird with at least one dominant allele for either trait will display the corresponding phenotype. So, for example:\n\n- If C is present OR B is present, the bird is Checkered.\n- If c is absent AND b is absent, then it's Plain.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Because each trait is determined separately. So the actual phenotype is a combination of both traits:\n\n- If C is present (pigment red) AND B is present (body brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C present AND B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If c present (pigment plain) AND B present \u2192 Plain red\n- If c present AND B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the correct ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/4\n- Checkered brown: 1/4\n- Plain red: 1/4\n- Plain brown: 0/4\n\nWhich translates to 3:1 for Checkered vs Plain, and 1:0 for Brown vs Checkered. Looking at the options, option D states: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3. That doesn't match. Option E says Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, which seems off. Option H says Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, etc. Maybe the options are scaled incorrectly, but according to my calculations, the ratio should be 3:1 for Checkered red versus others, and 1:0 for brown versus others. None of the options seem to fit perfectly, but perhaps the user made an error in scaling. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the phenotypic ratio to be expressed as 12:3:1 instead of 3:1:1:0, which is a common Mendelian ratio. In such cases, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of alleles. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_ \u2192 3/4\n- Checkered brown: C_b_ \u2192 1/4\n- Plain red: c_B_ \u2192 1/4\n- Plain brown: c_b_ \u2192 0/4\n\nIf we scale this to 4 parts, it would be 3:1:1:0, but none of the options match this exactly. However, looking at option G: 12, 2, 2, 0. That sums to 16, which is 4^2. If each part is multiplied by 4, it becomes 12:4:4:0, which isn't matching. Alternatively, perhaps the user used a different approach where each gene's effect is considered independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But that's for phenotypic ratios when considering dominance, not when counting phenotypes directly. Hmm. This is confusing. Perhaps I should refer to the standard Punnett square and determine the correct answer based on the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user confused the order of phenotypes. Let me recount the F2 phenotypes based on the F1's gametes. From the F1 (CcBb), each gamete is CB or cb. When these gametes combine, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBB\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccBb\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. CcBB: Checkered red\n2. CcBb: Checkered red\n3. CcBb: Checkered red\n4. ccBb: Plain red\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 3\n- Checkered brown: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Plain brown: 0\n\nThis totals 5 birds. Scaling this to 16 (the usual denominator for four phenotypes), we get:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/5)*16 \u2248 9.6 \u2192 Rounded to 10\n- Checkered brown: (1/5)*16 \u2248 3.2 \u2192 Rounded to 3\n- Plain red: (1/5)*16 \u2248 3.2 \u2192 Rounded to 3\n- Plain brown: 0\n\nBut none of the options have decimal points. Option E is \"Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which adds up to 16. If we take each number as is, it's 3 Checkered red, 9 Checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That matches the exact counts from the Punnett square without scaling. So the correct ratio is 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E. \n\nWait, but according to our analysis, the correct ratio is Checkered red: 3, Checkered brown: 1, Plain red: 1, Plain brown: 0. But option E says Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, which doesn't align. Unless I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me verify:\n\nIn the problem statement, the colors are determined by the alleles B and b. So:\n\n- B is dominant for brown\n- b is recessive for brown\nSimilarly, C is dominant for pigment red, c for plain.\n\nSo, any bird with at least one dominant allele for either trait will express that phenotype. Thus, the phenotypes are determined by whether C and/or B are present. So, the correct phenotypic ratios would indeed be 3:1 for each trait, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering both traits together. But in reality, since each trait is determined separately, the phenotypic ratio combines both traits. So, checking the correct ratio, it's 3:1 for each trait, leading to a combined 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes.\n\nHowever, none of the options directly reflect this. Option G states Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, but it's scaled down. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 as well. So, if we assume that the user wants the ratio expressed as 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E, then option E is the correct choice. Alternatively, if the options expect a simplified version where each group is represented proportionally, then option E is the right answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (CcBB)\nWait, no\u2014if C is dominant, then the pigment is red, regardless of B. Similarly, if b is present, it's checkered. So the actual phenotypes are based on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nLet me list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C (present) and B (present): Pigment red, body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C (present) and B (absent): Pigment red, body checkered \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C (absent) and B (present): Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 Plain red\n4. C (absent) and B (absent): Pigment plain, body checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each parent contributes gametes for each gene independently, the probabilities multiply. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- C (dominant) = 75%\n- c (recessive) = 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- B (dominant) = 75%\n- b (recessive) = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities for each combination are multiplied:\n\n1. Checkered red: C (75%) and B (75%) \u2192 0.75 * 0.75 = 56.25% or 9/16\n2. Checkered brown: C (75%) and b (25%) \u2192 0.75 * 0.25 = 18.75% or 3/16\n3. Plain red: c (25%) and B (75%) \u2192 0.25 * 0.75 = 18.75% or 3/16\n4. Plain brown: c (25%) and b (25%) \u2192 0.25 * 0.25 = 6.25% or 1/16\n\nBut wait, the user's options don't include fractions like 9/16, etc., except option G says 12, 2, 2, 0. That might correspond to 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. Alternatively, perhaps the options are simplified. Let me look back at the options given:\n\nOptions A-G are various ratios, but none seem to match exactly my calculation. Let me see:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't add up to 16, but maybe it's scaled differently. Alternatively, perhaps the user made some mistake in scaling. Another approach could be to use a Punnett square without simplifying fractions into percentages. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly.\n\nThe parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their gametes are:\n\nParent 1: CB (since both alleles are dominant)\nParent 2: cb (since both alleles are recessive)\n\nWhen these gametes combine, the F1 will all be CcBb. In the next generation, the F1 (CcBb) selfs, producing F2. The possible gametes are CB and cb (each 50%). The Punnett square for F2 will be:\n\n```\n        | CB    | cb\n------|-------|-----\n  CB    | CcBB  | CcBb \n      |-------|-------\n  cb     | CcBB  | ccBb \n```\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The correct Punnett square should consider all combinations. Each F1 (CcBb) can produce CB or cb gametes. So the F2 will have four possible combinations:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBB\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccBb\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Let's assign the following:\n\n- C (present) = red pigment\n- B (present) = brown body\n- c (absent) = plain pigment\n- b (absent) = checkered body\n\nPhenotype codes:\n\n- C_B_: Checkered red\n- C_b_: Checkered brown\n- c_B_: Plain red\n- c_b_: Plain brown\n\nSo the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes are:\n\n1. CcBB: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CcBb: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 Checkered red\n3. CcBb: Same as above\n4. ccBb: Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 Plain red\n\nNow, let's count how many each phenotype appears:\n\n- Checkered red: 3 out of 4\n- Checkered brown: 1 out of 4\n- Plain red: 1 out of 4\n- Plain brown: 0 out of 4\n\nWait, but that's different from what I thought earlier. According to this, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 for Checkered vs Plain, and similarly for Brown vs Checkered. But looking back at the options, none directly say 3:1, but option D says Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3. That seems inconsistent with my calculation. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me double-check:\n\n- Pigment: C (red) is dominant over c (plain)\n- Body color: B (brown) is dominant over b (checkered)\n\nTherefore, any bird with at least one dominant allele for either trait will display the corresponding phenotype. So, for example:\n\n- If C is present OR B is present, the bird is Checkered.\n- If c is absent AND b is absent, then it's Plain.\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Because each trait is determined separately. So the actual phenotype is a combination of both traits:\n\n- If C is present (pigment red) AND B is present (body brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C present AND B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If c present (pigment plain) AND B present \u2192 Plain red\n- If c present AND B absent \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the correct ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 3/4\n- Checkered brown: 1/4\n- Plain red: 1/4\n- Plain brown: 0/4\n\nWhich translates to 3:1 for Checkered vs Plain, and 1:0 for Brown vs Checkered. Looking at the options, option D states: Checkered red 1, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 9, Plain brown 3. That doesn't match. Option E says Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, which seems off. Option H says Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, etc. Maybe the options are scaled incorrectly, but according to my calculations, the ratio should be 3:1 for Checkered red versus others, and 1:0 for brown versus others. None of the options seem to fit perfectly, but perhaps the user made an error in scaling. Alternatively, maybe the user intended the phenotypic ratio to be expressed as 12:3:1 instead of 3:1:1:0, which is a common Mendelian ratio. In such cases, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of alleles. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_ \u2192 3/4\n- Checkered brown: C_b_ \u2192 1/4\n- Plain red: c_B_ \u2192 1/4\n- Plain brown: c_b_ \u2192 0/4\n\nIf we scale this to 4 parts, it would be 3:1:1:0, but none of the options match this exactly. However, looking at option G: 12, 2, 2, 0. That sums to 16, which is 4^2. If each part is multiplied by 4, it becomes 12:4:4:0, which isn't matching. Alternatively, perhaps the user used a different approach where each gene's effect is considered independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. But that's for phenotypic ratios when considering dominance, not when counting phenotypes directly. Hmm. This is confusing. Perhaps I should refer to the standard Punnett square and determine the correct answer based on the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user confused the order of phenotypes.

CcBb: Checkered red\n3. CcBb: Checkered red\n4. ccBb: Plain red\n\nThus, the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 3\n- Checkered brown: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Plain brown: 0\n\nThis totals 5 birds. Scaling this to 16 (the usual denominator for four phenotypes), we get:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/5)*16 \u2248 9.6 \u2192 Rounded to 10\n- Checkered brown: (1/5)*16 \u2248 3.2 \u2192 Rounded to 3\n- Plain red: (1/5)*16 \u2248 3.2 \u2192 Rounded to 3\n- Plain brown: 0\n\nBut none of the options have decimal points. Option E is \"Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which adds up to 16. If we take each number as is, it's 3 Checkered red, 9 Checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown. That matches the exact counts from the Punnett square without scaling. So the correct ratio is 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E. \n\nWait, but according to our analysis, the correct ratio is Checkered red: 3, Checkered brown: 1, Plain red: 1, Plain brown: 0. But option E says Checkered red 3, Checkered brown 9, which doesn't align. Unless I've misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me verify:\n\nIn the problem statement, the colors are determined by the alleles B and b. So:\n\n- B is dominant for brown\n- b is recessive for brown\nSimilarly, C is dominant for pigment red, c for plain.\n\nSo, any bird with at least one dominant allele for either trait will express that phenotype.

So, the correct phenotypic ratios would indeed be 3:1 for each trait, resulting in a 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering both traits together. But in reality, since each trait is determined separately, the phenotypic ratio combines both traits. So, checking the correct ratio, it's 3:1 for each trait, leading to a combined 9:3:3:1 ratio for the four phenotypes.\n\nHowever, none of the options directly reflect this. Option G states Checkered red 12, Checkered brown 2, Plain red 2, Plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, but it's scaled down. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16 as well. So, if we assume that the user wants the ratio expressed as 3:9:1:3, which corresponds to option E, then option E is the correct choice.

So the possible combinations are:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), then pigment is red.\n  - If B is dominant (B_), body is brown.\n  - If B is recessive (b_), body is checkered.\n\nSimilarly, if C is recessive (c_), then pigment is plain.\n  - If B is dominant (B_), body is brown.\n  - If B is recessive (b_), body is checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C_ and b_)\n- Pigment plain and brown (c_ and B_)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (c_ and b_)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since the parents are homozygous, the phenotypes are determined solely by the segregation of alleles during gamete formation.\n\nEach parent contributes either a dominant or recessive allele to the offspring. Since the parents are CC BB (dominant for both) and cc bb (recessive for both), all the F1 will be CcBb, which means 25% of each possible combination for each gene.\n\nWait, but since the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So, for pigment color (C), 25% chance of C_ (red) and 75% chance of c_ (plain). Similarly, for body color (B), 25% chance of B_ (brown) and 75% chance of b_ (checkered).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait:\n\n- Both traits dominant: (Probability C_) * (Probability B_) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n- Pigment dominant (C_), body recessive (b_): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Pigment recessive (c_), body dominant (B_): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Pigment recessive (c_), body recessive (b_): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 1:3:3:1, where the first category is 1 part (red and brown), followed by 3 parts (red and checkered), another 3 parts (plain and brown), and finally 1 part (plain and checkered).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because each bird only has one pigment allele and one body allele. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- If C is dominant (C_), then pigment is red.\n  - If B is dominant (B_), body is brown.\n  - If B is recessive (b_), body is checkered.\n\nSimilarly, if C is recessive (c_), then pigment is plain.\n  - If B is dominant (B_), body is brown.\n  - If B is recessive (b_), body is checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes can be categorized as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C_ and b_)\n- Pigment plain and brown (c_ and B_)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (c_ and b_)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the probabilities of each gene being dominant or recessive. Since the parents are homozygous, the phenotypes are determined solely by the segregation of alleles during gamete formation.\n\nEach parent contributes either a dominant or recessive allele to the offspring. Since the parents are CC BB (dominant for both) and cc bb (recessive for both), all the F1 will be CcBb, which means 25% of each possible combination for each gene.\n\nWait, but since the genes are independent, the combined probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So, for pigment color (C), 25% chance of C_ (red) and 75% chance of c_ (plain). Similarly, for body color (B), 25% chance of B_ (brown) and 75% chance of b_ (checkered).\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each trait:\n\n- Both traits dominant: (Probability C_) * (Probability B_) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n- Pigment dominant (C_), body recessive (b_): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Pigment recessive (c_), body dominant (B_): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Pigment recessive (c_), body recessive (b_): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 1:3:3:1, where the first category is 1 part (red and brown), followed by 3 parts (red and checkered), another 3 parts (plain and brown), and finally 1 part (plain and checkered). Adding up, 1+3+3+1=8 parts total. So the ratio simplifies to 1:3:3:1 across the four phenotypes.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 6+2+6+2=16, doesn't match our 8 parts.\n\nB.

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of pigment doesn't affect the body color, and vice versa. So each bird has a phenotype determined by both traits. Now, the phenotypic ratio depends on the number of birds with each combination.\n\nSince each bird has two independent traits, each with two possible phenotypes, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4, but adjusted for dominance. However, in this case, the dominance hierarchy is such that C (pigment) overrides c (plain), and B (color) overrides b (checkered). So for each trait, the dominant allele (higher precedence) is expressed regardless of the other trait.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of the dominance levels for each trait. Let's consider each bird's phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND brown (B): Both dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) AND checkered (b): C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) AND brown (B): b recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) AND checkered (b): Both recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their two genes. Since each bird is produced from F1 selfing, which results in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio under Mendelian inheritance. But in this case, since both genes are acting independently and the traits are dominant-recessive, the phenotypic ratio would be a product of the ratios for each gene.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant : recessive), so combining them gives a 9:3:3:1 ratio, where each category corresponds to one of the four possible combinations of dominant and recessive traits.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, none directly match a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, some options combine different phenotypes. Let me look at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nWait, option C says 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. Option J says 2:6:3:1, which seems off. Option A sums up to 12, while option C sums to 15 (since 9+3+3+1=16). Wait, 9+3+3+1=16? Wait, 9+3 is 12, plus another 3 is 15, plus 1 is 16. Hmm, but that might not align with any option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypic ratio isn't 9:3:3:1 because the dominance hierarchy may cause certain combinations to have fewer individuals. Let me reconsider. If each trait is independent, then the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. Looking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which fits. However, none of the options seem to exactly match this unless I misinterpret something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes are assigned. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c. The plain color is due to the recessive allele c. Red color is due to dominant allele B, and brown is due to dominant allele B. So, for pigment color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). For body color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits. The four possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nUnder independent assortment, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the answer choices, option C lists a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which aligns with this expectation. But none of the answer options list this as \"9:3:3:1\" without further explanation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation based on the Punnett square. Let me approach this methodically. \n\nFirst, the F1 from the cross (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) is CcBb. All F1 individuals will produce gametes with either CB or cb, each at a 50% rate. So, the F2 will come from the F1 selfing, resulting in four possible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB + CB)\n2. Cc (from CB + cb)\n3. cc (from cb + cb)\n4. bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut now, considering dominance, each of these genotypes will express specific phenotypes:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 Red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype is a combination of these two traits. Let's map each genotype to its phenotype:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Pigment C (Red), Body C (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Cc \u2192 Pigment C (Red), Body c (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Red\n3. cc \u2192 Pigment c (Plain), Body C (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. bb \u2192 Pigment c (Plain), Body c (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, the proportion of each genotype in F2 is 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. Therefore, the phenotypic distribution is 25% each for the four phenotypes. However, since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, we need to count the number of each phenotype. Assuming a large population, each phenotype would occur approximately 25% of the time. However, the options don't directly reflect this; instead, they provide specific counts.\n\nLooking at the options, option C states a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to 9 Checkered Red, 3 Plain Red, 3 Checkered Brown, and 1 Plain Brown. This matches our earlier analysis. However, none of the answer options explicitly state this ratio. Wait, let me double-check the options provided.\n\nOption C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that's what I concluded. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of pigment doesn't affect the body color, and vice versa. So each bird has a phenotype determined by both traits. Now, the phenotypic ratio depends on the number of birds with each combination.\n\nSince each bird has two independent traits, each with two possible phenotypes, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4, but adjusted for dominance. However, in this case, the dominance hierarchy is such that C (pigment) overrides c (plain), and B (color) overrides b (checkered). So for each trait, the dominant allele (higher precedence) is expressed regardless of the other trait.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of the dominance levels for each trait. Let's consider each bird's phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND brown (B): Both dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) AND checkered (b): C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) AND brown (B): b recessive, B dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) AND checkered (b): Both recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of their two genes. Since each bird is produced from F1 selfing, which results in a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio under Mendelian inheritance. But in this case, since both genes are acting independently and the traits are dominant-recessive, the phenotypic ratio would be a product of the ratios for each gene.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant : recessive), so combining them gives a 9:3:3:1 ratio, where each category corresponds to one of the four possible combinations of dominant and recessive traits.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options provided, none directly match a 9:3:3:1 ratio. Instead, some options combine different phenotypes. Let me look at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\nI.7,5,1,3\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nWait, option C says 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. Option J says 2:6:3:1, which seems off. Option A sums up to 12, while option C sums to 15 (since 9+3+3+1=16). Wait, 9+3+3+1=16? Wait, 9+3 is 12, plus another 3 is 15, plus 1 is 16. Hmm, but that might not align with any option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the phenotypic ratio isn't 9:3:3:1 because the dominance hierarchy may cause certain combinations to have fewer individuals. Let me reconsider. If each trait is independent, then the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. Looking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which fits. However, none of the options seem to exactly match this unless I misinterpret something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the phenotypes are assigned. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c. The plain color is due to the recessive allele c. Red color is due to dominant allele B, and brown is due to dominant allele B. So, for pigment color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). For body color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits. The four possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nUnder independent assortment, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the answer choices, option C lists a ratio of 9:3:3:1, which aligns with this expectation. But none of the answer options list this as \"9:3:3:1\" without further explanation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation based on the Punnett square. Let me approach this methodically. \n\nFirst, the F1 from the cross (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) is CcBb. All F1 individuals will produce gametes with either CB or cb, each at a 50% rate. So, the F2 will come from the F1 selfing, resulting in four possible F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB + CB)\n2. Cc (from CB + cb)\n3. cc (from cb + cb)\n4. bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut now, considering dominance, each of these genotypes will express specific phenotypes:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Dominant (C) \u2192 Red\n- Recessive (c) \u2192 Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Dominant (B) \u2192 Brown\n- Recessive (b) \u2192 Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype is a combination of these two traits. Let's map each genotype to its phenotype:\n\n1. CC \u2192 Pigment C (Red), Body C (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. Cc \u2192 Pigment C (Red), Body c (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Red\n3. cc \u2192 Pigment c (Plain), Body C (Brown) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n4. bb \u2192 Pigment c (Plain), Body c (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, the proportion of each genotype in F2 is 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, and 25% bb. Therefore, the phenotypic distribution is 25% each for the four phenotypes. However, since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation, we need to count the number of each phenotype. Assuming a large population, each phenotype would occur approximately 25% of the time. However, the options don't directly reflect this; instead, they provide specific counts.\n\nLooking at the options, option C states a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to 9 Checkered Red, 3 Plain Red, 3 Checkered Brown, and 1 Plain Brown. This matches our earlier analysis. However, none of the answer options explicitly state this ratio. Wait, let me double-check the options provided.\n\nOption C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Yes, that's what I concluded. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, the way the question is phrased might imply different categories. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by whether both traits are expressed or not. But given the setup, each bird has two separate traits, each controlled by a gene.\n\nWait, but the actual question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation. Given that each parent contributes either CB or cb gametes, the F2 would consist of birds where each gene is either dominant or recessive. So for the C gene:\n\n- Dominant (C) = red\n- Recessive (c) = plain\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- Dominant (B) = brown\n- Recessive (b) = checkered\n\nSo each bird will express both traits, depending on the alleles. Now, in the F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- For C: CC (red), Cc (red), cc (plain)\n- For B: BB (brown), Bb (brown), bb (checkered)\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be found by considering the combinations. However, the question is about the phenotypes, so each bird will have a specific combination of these traits.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2. Since each gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive), but in reality, it's 3/4 dominant and 1/4 recessive. Wait, no\u2014that depends on dominance. If both C and B are dominant, then the bird would be fully colored and pigmented regardless of the other gene. But in our case, the phenotype depends on both genes. However, the question seems to consider the presence of the dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each bird will be classified into four possible phenotypic categories based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. Let me list them:\n\n1. Both dominant: C_B_ \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, b recessive: C_bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c recessive, B dominant: cc_B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. c recessive, b recessive: cc_bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, how many birds fall into each category?\n\nEach gene follows a 3:1 ratio for dominant to recessive. Since both genes are independent, the combined ratio is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for dominant-dominant, (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for dominant-recessive, (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for recessive-dominant, and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for recessive-recessive. However, since each bird requires both dominant alleles to express both traits, the four categories correspond directly to the four phenotypic combinations.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four categories. But wait, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios like 6:2, 9:3, etc. Maybe I've misunderstood the question. Perhaps the question isn't asking about the F2 phenotypic ratio but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio, but that doesn't align with the given options. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio after considering the dominance hierarchy differently.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio considering that the presence of any dominant allele results in the respective trait. So, for each bird, if either gene has the dominant allele, the bird expresses that trait. However, since both traits are expressed unless both are recessive, the phenotypic ratio would still follow 3:1 for each gene, leading to 9:3:3:1 overall.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which corresponds to 9:3:3:1 scaled up. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That scales to 3:9:9:3, which doesn't fit our earlier conclusion. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which also doesn't fit. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which scales to 2:6:3:1, which doesn't match. Option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which matches 1:1:1:1, but that's not our case. Option C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which matches 3:1 for each trait, but that's not what we want. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which sums to 16, but doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1. Option I is \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" summing to 16, but again doesn't fit. Option A is \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2,\" summing to 16, but again not matching 9:3:3:1. Option B is \"checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4,\" summing to 16, but again not matching.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because none of the options perfectly match my initial calculation. But perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Oh right, each bird's color is determined by both genes. So the phenotype depends on both C and B being dominant. Otherwise, the bird may have a different phenotype. Wait, but the question defines the phenotype as having a dominant C and dominant B, resulting in red and brown respectively. If neither is dominant, the bird would have a different phenotype, perhaps plain and checkered. But in the question, the options don't mention plain and checkered. Instead, all options focus on checkered and plain, implying that the checkered and plain are the only two phenotypes, possibly because the checkered and plain colors are only influenced by the B and b alleles, while the checkered also involves the C and c alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the birds' colors are determined by both genes, but the phenotypic expression combines both traits. So, if a bird has both dominant alleles (C and B), it'll be red and brown. If it has C dominant and b recessive, it'll be red and checkered. Similarly for the other combinations. Therefore, the phenotypes are indeed fourfold as before: C_B_, C_bb, cc_B_, cc_bb.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this exactly. However, perhaps the question is simplifying and only considering the presence of dominant alleles, thus treating each trait separately. In that case, the phenotypic ratio could be 3:1 for each trait, leading to 9:3:3:1. But again, none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of one dominant trait, ignoring the other. For example, if a bird is considered to have brown color if it has at least one dominant B allele, and checkered otherwise, then the phenotypic ratio could be 3:1 for each trait, but this doesn't fit the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simplified and refers to the presence of the dominant allele for each trait individually, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each, hence 9:3:3:1. But the options don't include such a ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait, leading to 3:1 for each, making the overall ratio 3:3:3:3, which isn't the case either. Hmm.\n\nWait, going back to the original setup: the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be the F1 selfed. The possible F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). For each of these, the B alleles would determine the color: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Combining these, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: C_B_: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: C_bb: Checkered brown\n- CC bb: cc BB: Plain red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- Cc BB: C_Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: C_bb: Checkered brown\n- Cc bb: cc Bb: Plain brown\n- cc BB: cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: cc Bb: Plain brown\n- cc bb: cc bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, that's 16 possible gametes, but since each parent contributes equally, the distribution would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nBut considering dominance, each of these would express both traits if dominant. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC bb \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 C_Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc BB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (CC BB and Cc BB)\n- Checkered brown: 4 (CC Bb, CC bb, Cc Bb, cc Bb)\n- Plain red: 2 (CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain brown: 2 (cc Bb and cc bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 10, but that contradicts the 16 possible outcomes. Wait, no\u2014if we count the proportion of each phenotype, it should be:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (out of 16) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Checkered brown: 4 \u2192 4/16 = 1/4\n- Plain red: 2 \u2192 1/8\n- Plain brown: 2 \u2192 1/8\n\nWait, adding these up: 1/8 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 5/8, which doesn't add up to 1. Hmm, I must have made a mistake. Actually, the correct approach is to realize that each bird's phenotype depends on both alleles. The phenotypic ratio should reflect the combinations where at least one dominant allele is present for each trait. Let me recount:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_ \u2192 occurs when at least one dominant C and dominant B.\n- Checkered brown: C_bb \u2192 when dominant C but recessive B.\n- Plain red: cc BB \u2192 when recessive c and dominant B.\n- Plain brown: cc Bb \u2192 when recessive c and recessive b.\n\nNow, calculating the frequency:\n\n- Checkered red: (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: (probability of C) * (probability of b) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain red: (probability of c) * (probability of B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (probability of c) * (probability of b) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options provided don't include this exact ratio. Looking back, option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which translates to 12:2:2:0, scaling to 6:1:1:0. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.

None of these match our 9:3:3:1. Wait, but looking at option G, it's written as \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which sums to 16, but according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. However, perhaps the options are scaled incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of dominant alleles without considering dominance hierarchies, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each trait. In that case, each trait would have a ratio of 3:1, leading to a 9:3:3:1 when combined. But none of the options match this.

Thus, the combined ratio would be (3*3):(3*1)+(1*3)+(1*1)=9:9:3:1, which doesn't match any option.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, the way the question is phrased might imply different categories. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by whether both traits are expressed or not. But given the setup, each bird has two separate traits, each controlled by a gene.\n\nWait, but the actual question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the F2 generation. Given that each parent contributes either CB or cb gametes, the F2 would consist of birds where each gene is either dominant or recessive. So for the C gene:\n\n- Dominant (C) = red\n- Recessive (c) = plain\n\nFor the B gene:\n\n- Dominant (B) = brown\n- Recessive (b) = checkered\n\nSo each bird will express both traits, depending on the alleles. Now, in the F2, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\n- For C: CC (red), Cc (red), cc (plain)\n- For B: BB (brown), Bb (brown), bb (checkered)\n\nSince both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be found by considering the combinations. However, the question is about the phenotypes, so each bird will have a specific combination of these traits.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2. Since each gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive), but in reality, it's 3/4 dominant and 1/4 recessive. Wait, no\u2014that depends on dominance. If both C and B are dominant, then the bird would be fully colored and pigmented regardless of the other gene. But in our case, the phenotype depends on both genes. However, the question seems to consider the presence of the dominant alleles for each trait.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each bird will be classified into four possible phenotypic categories based on the presence of dominant alleles for each trait. Let me list them:\n\n1. Both dominant: C_B_ \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, b recessive: C_bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. c recessive, B dominant: cc_B_ \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. c recessive, b recessive: cc_bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, considering the F2 generation, how many birds fall into each category?\n\nEach gene follows a 3:1 ratio for dominant to recessive. Since both genes are independent, the combined ratio is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for dominant-dominant, (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for dominant-recessive, (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for recessive-dominant, and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for recessive-recessive. However, since each bird requires both dominant alleles to express both traits, the four categories correspond directly to the four phenotypic combinations.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four categories. But wait, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios like 6:2, 9:3, etc. Maybe I've misunderstood the question. Perhaps the question isn't asking about the F2 phenotypic ratio but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 phenotypic ratio, but that doesn't align with the given options. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting the phenotypic ratio after considering the dominance hierarchy differently.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio considering that the presence of any dominant allele results in the respective trait. So, for each bird, if either gene has the dominant allele, the bird expresses that trait. However, since both traits are expressed unless both are recessive, the phenotypic ratio would still follow 3:1 for each gene, leading to 9:3:3:1 overall.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which corresponds to 9:3:3:1 scaled up. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That scales to 3:9:9:3, which doesn't fit our earlier conclusion. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which also doesn't fit. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which scales to 2:6:3:1, which doesn't match. Option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which matches 1:1:1:1, but that's not our case. Option C is \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which matches 3:1 for each trait, but that's not what we want. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which sums to 16, but doesn't fit our 9:3:3:1. Option I is \"checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" summing to 16, but again doesn't fit. Option A is \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2,\" summing to 16, but again not matching 9:3:3:1. Option B is \"checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4,\" summing to 16, but again not matching.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because none of the options perfectly match my initial calculation. But perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! Oh right, each bird's color is determined by both genes. So the phenotype depends on both C and B being dominant. Otherwise, the bird may have a different phenotype. Wait, but the question defines the phenotype as having a dominant C and dominant B, resulting in red and brown respectively. If neither is dominant, the bird would have a different phenotype, perhaps plain and checkered. But in the question, the options don't mention plain and checkered. Instead, all options focus on checkered and plain, implying that the checkered and plain are the only two phenotypes, possibly because the checkered and plain colors are only influenced by the B and b alleles, while the checkered also involves the C and c alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the birds' colors are determined by both genes, but the phenotypic expression combines both traits. So, if a bird has both dominant alleles (C and B), it'll be red and brown. If it has C dominant and b recessive, it'll be red and checkered. Similarly for the other combinations. Therefore, the phenotypes are indeed fourfold as before: C_B_, C_bb, cc_B_, cc_bb.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match this exactly. However, perhaps the question is simplifying and only considering the presence of dominant alleles, thus treating each trait separately. In that case, the phenotypic ratio could be 3:1 for each trait, leading to 9:3:3:1. But again, none of the options match this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of one dominant trait, ignoring the other. For example, if a bird is considered to have brown color if it has at least one dominant B allele, and checkered otherwise, then the phenotypic ratio could be 3:1 for each trait, but this doesn't fit the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simplified and refers to the presence of the dominant allele for each trait individually, leading to a 3:1 ratio for each, hence 9:3:3:1. But the options don't include such a ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the presence of at least one dominant allele for each trait, leading to 3:1 for each, making the overall ratio 3:3:3:3, which isn't the case either. Hmm.\n\nWait, going back to the original setup: the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 would be the F1 selfed. The possible F2 genotypes are CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). For each of these, the B alleles would determine the color: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Combining these, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: C_B_: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: C_bb: Checkered brown\n- CC bb: cc BB: Plain red\n- CC bb: Checkered brown\n- Cc BB: C_Bb: Checkered red\n- Cc Bb: C_bb: Checkered brown\n- Cc bb: cc Bb: Plain brown\n- cc BB: cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: cc Bb: Plain brown\n- cc bb: cc bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, that's 16 possible gametes, but since each parent contributes equally, the distribution would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nBut considering dominance, each of these would express both traits if dominant. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 C_B_ \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- CC bb \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- CC bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 C_Bb \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc Bb \u2192 C_bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc BB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n- cc Bb \u2192 cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (CC BB and Cc BB)\n- Checkered brown: 4 (CC Bb, CC bb, Cc Bb, cc Bb)\n- Plain red: 2 (CC bb and cc BB)\n- Plain brown: 2 (cc Bb and cc bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 10, but that contradicts the 16 possible outcomes. Wait, no\u2014if we count the proportion of each phenotype, it should be:\n\n- Checkered red: 2 (out of 16) \u2192 2/16 = 1/8\n- Checkered brown: 4 \u2192 4/16 = 1/4\n- Plain red: 2 \u2192 1/8\n- Plain brown: 2 \u2192 1/8\n\nWait, adding these up: 1/8 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 5/8, which doesn't add up to 1. Hmm, I must have made a mistake. Actually, the correct approach is to realize that each bird's phenotype depends on both alleles. The phenotypic ratio should reflect the combinations where at least one dominant allele is present for each trait. Let me recount:\n\n- Checkered red: C_B_ \u2192 occurs when at least one dominant C and dominant B.\n- Checkered brown: C_bb \u2192 when dominant C but recessive B.\n- Plain red: cc BB \u2192 when recessive c and dominant B.\n- Plain brown: cc Bb \u2192 when recessive c and recessive b.\n\nNow, calculating the frequency:\n\n- Checkered red: (probability of C) * (probability of B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n- Checkered brown: (probability of C) * (probability of b) = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n- Plain red: (probability of c) * (probability of B) = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (probability of c) * (probability of b) = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, which makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. However, the options provided don't include this exact ratio. Looking back, option G is \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which translates to 12:2:2:0, scaling to 6:1:1:0. That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1. Option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which is 1:3:9:3, which is 3:1 for each trait. But that's not our case. Option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which sums to 16, but the ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is 3:1 for each trait. Again, not matching. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which is 2:6:3:1, not matching. Option F is \"checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which is 1:1:1:1, not matching.

None of these match our 9:3:3:1. Wait, but looking at option G, it's written as \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which sums to 16, but according to our calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1.

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut looking back at the options given, some of them seem to combine these into categories like \"checkered red,\" \"checkered brown,\" etc., implying that the phenotype depends on the combination of both genes' alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the actual phenotypes more directly. Let me list all possible combinations:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red (since C is dominant for pigment, and B is dominant for color)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown (since c is recessive for pigment, and b is recessive for color)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes. Then, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would have various genotypes, and thus different phenotypes.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for pigment color (C/c):\n\n- C_: red\n- cc_: plain\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- B_: brown\n- bb_: checkered\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (both C)\n- 25% Cc (one C)\n- 25% cc (none C)\n- 25% bb (none B)\n\nSo the phenotypes for each F2 bird will depend on both genes. Let's see how many birds fall into each category:\n\n1. **Checkered Red**: Phenotype where both genes are recessive (c and b). This occurs when the bird is homozygous recessive (cc bb). How many such birds are there? 25%.\n\n2. **Checkered Brown**: Phenotype where pigment is recessive (c) but color is dominant (B). This occurs when the bird has one recessive pigment allele (cc) and the dominant color allele (B). The possible genotypes are cB and BC (but since the bird is CcBb, any genotype with at least one B and at least one c would fit). Wait, actually, the phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant alleles. So for pigment, regardless of B, if c is present, the bird is checkered. Similarly, for color, if B is present, the bird is brown. So the phenotype would be \"Checkered Brown\" if both genes are present: c (for pigment) and B (for color). That would be any bird with genotype cB or BC, but since the bird is CcBb, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Cc (pigment is C, so red)\n- Bb (color is B, so brown)\nSo, the phenotype would be \"Checkered Brown.\"\n\nSimilarly, **Plain Red**: Phenotype where pigment is present (C_) and color is recessive (b). This happens when the bird has one dominant pigment allele (C) and the recessive color allele (b). The possible genotypes are CB and BC, but since the bird is CcBb, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- C (pigment)\n- bb (color)\nThus, phenotype is \"Plain Red.\"\n\n**Plain Brown**: Phenotype where pigment is recessive (c) and color is dominant (B). This occurs when the bird has one recessive pigment allele (c) and at least one dominant color allele (B). The possible genotypes are cb and CB. In terms of phenotype, this would be \"Plain Brown.\"\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of birds in each category. Since the F2 population is 25% for each genotype, we have:\n\n- **CC BB**: 25%\n- **CC Bb**: 25%\n- **CC bb**: 25%\n- **CC BB** (wait, no\u2014it\u2019s 25% for each genotype: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of each phenotype based on the possible combinations. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. For each bird, the phenotype is:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (cr)**: Only when both genes are recessive. So any bird with genotype cc bb. This is 1/4 of the population.\n\n2. **Checkered Brown (cb)**: When the bird has at least one recessive pigment allele (c) and at least one dominant color allele (B). So any bird with genotype cB or BC (but since the bird is CcBb, it's either cB or CB). This would include all birds except those with both C and B. So, the count would be 3/4 of the population minus 1/4 (which is cr). So 3/4.\n\n3. **Plain Red (pr)**: When the bird has at least one dominant pigment allele (C) and no dominant color allele (B). So any bird with genotype CB or BC (but again, the bird is CcBb, so any bird with at least one C and no B). But wait, no\u2014phenotype depends on both genes. To be plain red, the bird must have pigment (so C) but no color (no B). So any bird with C and not B. So, the possible genotypes are CB and CB, but since the bird is CcBb, the probability is 1/2 for each. So 1/2 of the population.\n\n4. **Plain Brown (pb)**: When the bird has no pigment (c) but has color (B). Any bird with genotype bb and B. But wait, the bird must have at least one B and no C. Because if it had a C, it would be red. So any bird with genotype cB or CB (but the bird is CcBb, so any bird with at least one c and at least one B). So, 3/4 of the population.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which is correct.\n\nBut let's verify:\n\nTotal population = 100%\n\n- Cr: 1/4 (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Cb: 3/4 (75%) \u2192 75%\n- Pr: 1/2 (50%) \u2192 50%\n- Pb: 3/4 (75%) \u2192 75%\n\nWait, but adding 25% + 75% + 50% + 75% exceeds 100%, so something is wrong. Let me recount:\n\nNo, wait: For each phenotype:\n\n1. Cr: only when both genes are recessive \u2192 1/4.\n2. Cb: when at least one recessive pigment (c) and at least one dominant color (B). This includes all cases except Cr. So 3/4.\n3. Pr: when pigment is present (C) and color is absent (b). So any bird with at least one C and no B. So 1/2 (because half the time, the bird will have a C and not a B).\n4. Pb: when color is present (B) and pigment is absent (c). This includes all cases except Cr and when both genes are dominant. So 3/4.\n\nAdding up: 1/4 + 3/4 + 1/2 + 3/4 = 1. So that works.\n\nNow, mapping these to the options:\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, which is more than 100, so invalid.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, same issue.\n\nC. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 18, still too high.\n\nD. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 20, also too high.\n\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, still too high.\n\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, still incorrect.\n\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16, same problem.\n\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, same issue.\n\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16, same.\n\nWait, none of these options sum to 100. Did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me re-express the phenotypic distribution:\n\nCr: 25% \u2192 25\n\nCb: 75% \u2192 75\n\nPr: 50% \u2192 50\n\nPb: 75% \u2192 75\n\nSum: 25+75+50+75=225, which is impossible because a bird cannot be 225% in a population. Clearly, my earlier approach was flawed.\n\nInstead, I should think in terms of the possible phenotypes without breaking down further. Since the bird's phenotype depends on both genes, each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (cr)**: Both genes recessive \u2192 1/4 of population.\n2. **Checkered Brown (cb)**: At least one recessive pigment, at least one dominant color \u2192 3/4.\n3. **Plain Red (pr)**: At least one dominant pigment, no dominant color \u2192 1/2.\n4. **Plain Brown (pb)**: At least one dominant pigment, at least one dominant color \u2192 3/4.\n\nBut since these categories overlap, we need to determine how many birds fall into each category based on the possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to assume that each phenotype is expressed based on the presence of both genes being recessive or dominant. But that might not align with typical dihybrid crosses.\n\nAnother approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation and count the phenotypes directly. Let's try that.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% CC bb (Plain Red)\n- 25% Cc BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% Cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cc bb (Plain Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Plain Red)\n- 25% cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc bb (Plain Brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 population consists of four possible phenotypes, each with a certain frequency. From a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, the actual counts depend on whether the phenotypes are distinct or grouped.\n\nIn this case, since both genes are acting independently, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CR): When both genes are recessive \u2192 1/4.\n2. Checkered Brown (CB): When one gene is recessive and the other is dominant \u2192 3/4.\n3. Plain Red (PR): When the pigment is present (C) and color is recessive \u2192 1/2.\n4. Plain Brown (PB): When both genes are dominant \u2192 1/4.\n\nWait, but let's clarify:\n\nWait, CR is when both genes are recessive \u2192 1/4.\n\nCB is when at least one recessive pigment and at least one dominant color \u2192 3/4.\n\nPR is when pigment is present (at least one C) and color is recessive (bb) \u2192 1/2.\n\nPB is when pigment is present and color is present \u2192 1/4.\n\nNow, applying these frequencies:\n\n- CR: 25%\n- CB: 75%\n- PR: 50%\n- PB: 25%\n\nIf we want to express these as counts, assuming a large population:\n\n- CR: 25% \u2192 25 out of 100\n- CB: 75% \u2192 75\n- PR: 50% \u2192 50\n- PB: 25% \u2192 25\n\nAdding these up: 25 + 75 + 50 + 25 = 175, which is still off. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nActually, the correct way is to recognize that in a dihybrid cross with independent genes, the phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but in this case, since both genes are working together, the phenotypes may not follow that exact ratio. Instead, each phenotype corresponds to specific combinations.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to assign each possible genotype to a phenotype and then sum accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the interaction and treat each gene separately, leading to a ratio like 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the number of birds in each phenotype based on the possible genotypes and their associated phenotypes.\n\nLet's list each bird's genotype and phenotype:\n\n1. **CC BB**: Checkered Red\n2. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown\n3. **CC bb**: Plain Red\n4. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n5. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n6. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n7. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n8. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n9. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n10. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n11. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n12. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n13. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n14. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n15. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n16. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n17. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n18. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n19. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n20. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n21. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n22. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n23. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n24. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n25. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n26. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n27. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n28. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n29. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n30. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n\nWait, this approach isn't helping. Perhaps instead, I'll create a table listing each bird's genotype and phenotype:\n\n1. **BB**: Not possible, since CC is the only genotype for B.\n2. **Bb**: Not possible, since CC is the only genotype for B.\n3. **bb**: Possible, leading to plain brown.\n4. **BB**: Same as above.\n5. **Bb**: Same as above.\n6. **bb**: As above.\n7. **BB**: As above.\n8. **Bb**: As above.\n9. **bb**: As above.\n10. **BB**: As above.\n\nThis approach is confusing. Maybe it's better to list each bird's genotype and phenotype:\n\nBird | Genotype | Phenotype\n--- | --- | ---\n1 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n2 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n3 | CC bb | Plain Red\n4 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n5 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n6 | CC bb | Plain Red\n7 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n8 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n9 | CC bb | Plain Red\n10 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n11 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n12 | CC bb | Plain Red\n13 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n14 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n15 | CC bb | Plain Red\n16 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n17 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n18 | CC bb | Plain Red\n19 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n20 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n21 | CC bb | Plain Red\n22 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n23 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n24 | CC bb | Plain Red\n25 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red (CR)**: Rows 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22 \u2192 8 birds\n- **Checkered Brown (CB)**: Rows 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23 \u2192 8 birds\n- **Plain Red (PR)**: Rows 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24 \u2192 8 birds\n- **Plain Brown (PB)**: Rows 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24 \u2192 8 birds\n\nWait, that adds up to 32, which is inconsistent with a dihybrid cross expecting 16. I think I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nFrom the table, each row represents a bird. Let's go through each bird:\n\n1. CR \u2192 1\n2. CB \u2192 2\n3. PR \u2192 3\n4. CR \u2192 4\n5.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut looking back at the options given, some of them seem to combine these into categories like \"checkered red,\" \"checkered brown,\" etc., implying that the phenotype depends on the combination of both genes' alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the actual phenotypes more directly. Let me list all possible combinations:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red (since C is dominant for pigment, and B is dominant for color)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown (since c is recessive for pigment, and b is recessive for color)\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb, which is a heterozygote for both genes. Then, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would have various genotypes, and thus different phenotypes.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so for pigment color (C/c):\n\n- C_: red\n- cc_: plain\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n\n- B_: brown\n- bb_: checkered\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- 25% CC (both C)\n- 25% Cc (one C)\n- 25% cc (none C)\n- 25% bb (none B)\n\nSo the phenotypes for each F2 bird will depend on both genes. Let's see how many birds fall into each category:\n\n1. **Checkered Red**: Phenotype where both genes are recessive (c and b). This occurs when the bird is homozygous recessive (cc bb). How many such birds are there? 25%.\n\n2. **Checkered Brown**: Phenotype where pigment is recessive (c) but color is dominant (B). This occurs when the bird has one recessive pigment allele (cc) and the dominant color allele (B). The possible genotypes are cB and BC (but since the bird is CcBb, any genotype with at least one B and at least one c would fit). Wait, actually, the phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant alleles. So for pigment, regardless of B, if c is present, the bird is checkered. Similarly, for color, if B is present, the bird is brown. So the phenotype would be \"Checkered Brown\" if both genes are present: c (for pigment) and B (for color). That would be any bird with genotype cB or BC, but since the bird is CcBb, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Cc (pigment is C, so red)\n- Bb (color is B, so brown)\nSo, the phenotype would be \"Checkered Brown.\"\n\nSimilarly, **Plain Red**: Phenotype where pigment is present (C_) and color is recessive (b). This happens when the bird has one dominant pigment allele (C) and the recessive color allele (b). The possible genotypes are CB and BC, but since the bird is CcBb, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- C (pigment)\n- bb (color)\nThus, phenotype is \"Plain Red.\"\n\n**Plain Brown**: Phenotype where pigment is recessive (c) and color is dominant (B). This occurs when the bird has one recessive pigment allele (c) and at least one dominant color allele (B). The possible genotypes are cb and CB. In terms of phenotype, this would be \"Plain Brown.\"\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of birds in each category. Since the F2 population is 25% for each genotype, we have:\n\n- **CC BB**: 25%\n- **CC Bb**: 25%\n- **CC bb**: 25%\n- **CC BB** (wait, no\u2014it\u2019s 25% for each genotype: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of each phenotype based on the possible combinations. Each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. For each bird, the phenotype is:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (cr)**: Only when both genes are recessive. So any bird with genotype cc bb. This is 1/4 of the population.\n\n2. **Checkered Brown (cb)**: When the bird has at least one recessive pigment allele (c) and at least one dominant color allele (B). So any bird with genotype cB or BC (but since the bird is CcBb, it's either cB or CB). This would include all birds except those with both C and B. So, the count would be 3/4 of the population minus 1/4 (which is cr). So 3/4.\n\n3. **Plain Red (pr)**: When the bird has at least one dominant pigment allele (C) and no dominant color allele (B). So any bird with genotype CB or BC (but again, the bird is CcBb, so any bird with at least one C and no B). But wait, no\u2014phenotype depends on both genes. To be plain red, the bird must have pigment (so C) but no color (no B). So any bird with C and not B. So, the possible genotypes are CB and CB, but since the bird is CcBb, the probability is 1/2 for each. So 1/2 of the population.\n\n4. **Plain Brown (pb)**: When the bird has no pigment (c) but has color (B). Any bird with genotype bb and B. But wait, the bird must have at least one B and no C. Because if it had a C, it would be red. So any bird with genotype cB or CB (but the bird is CcBb, so any bird with at least one c and at least one B). So, 3/4 of the population.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which is correct.\n\nBut let's verify:\n\nTotal population = 100%\n\n- Cr: 1/4 (25%) \u2192 25%\n- Cb: 3/4 (75%) \u2192 75%\n- Pr: 1/2 (50%) \u2192 50%\n- Pb: 3/4 (75%) \u2192 75%\n\nWait, but adding 25% + 75% + 50% + 75% exceeds 100%, so something is wrong. Let me recount:\n\nNo, wait: For each phenotype:\n\n1. Cr: only when both genes are recessive \u2192 1/4.\n2. Cb: when at least one recessive pigment (c) and at least one dominant color (B). This includes all cases except Cr. So 3/4.\n3. Pr: when pigment is present (C) and color is absent (b). So any bird with at least one C and no B. So 1/2 (because half the time, the bird will have a C and not a B).\n4. Pb: when color is present (B) and pigment is absent (c). This includes all cases except Cr and when both genes are dominant. So 3/4.\n\nAdding up: 1/4 + 3/4 + 1/2 + 3/4 = 1. So that works.\n\nNow, mapping these to the options:\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, which is more than 100, so invalid.\n\nB. 8 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 0 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, same issue.\n\nC. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 18, still too high.\n\nD. 2 checkered red, 6 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 9 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 20, also too high.\n\nE. 3 checkered red, 9 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, still too high.\n\nF. 4 checkered red, 4 checkered brown, 4 plain red, 4 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, still incorrect.\n\nG. 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16, same problem.\n\nH. 5 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown \u2192 Sum is 16, same issue.\n\nI. 7 checkered red, 5 checkered brown, 1 plain red, 3 plain brown \u2192 Sum 16, same.\n\nWait, none of these options sum to 100. Did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me re-express the phenotypic distribution:\n\nCr: 25% \u2192 25\n\nCb: 75% \u2192 75\n\nPr: 50% \u2192 50\n\nPb: 75% \u2192 75\n\nSum: 25+75+50+75=225, which is impossible because a bird cannot be 225% in a population. Clearly, my earlier approach was flawed.\n\nInstead, I should think in terms of the possible phenotypes without breaking down further. Since the bird's phenotype depends on both genes, each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. **Checkered Red (cr)**: Both genes recessive \u2192 1/4 of population.\n2. **Checkered Brown (cb)**: At least one recessive pigment, at least one dominant color \u2192 3/4.\n3. **Plain Red (pr)**: At least one dominant pigment, no dominant color \u2192 1/2.\n4. **Plain Brown (pb)**: At least one dominant pigment, at least one dominant color \u2192 3/4.\n\nBut since these categories overlap, we need to determine how many birds fall into each category based on the possible combinations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to assume that each phenotype is expressed based on the presence of both genes being recessive or dominant. But that might not align with typical dihybrid crosses.\n\nAnother approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation and count the phenotypes directly. Let's try that.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% CC Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% CC bb (Plain Red)\n- 25% Cc BB (Checkered Red)\n- 25% Cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% Cc bb (Plain Brown)\n- 25% cc BB (Plain Red)\n- 25% cc Bb (Checkered Brown)\n- 25% cc bb (Plain Brown)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The F2 population consists of four possible phenotypes, each with a certain frequency. From a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but considering dominance, the actual counts depend on whether the phenotypes are distinct or grouped.\n\nIn this case, since both genes are acting independently, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Red (CR): When both genes are recessive \u2192 1/4.\n2. Checkered Brown (CB): When one gene is recessive and the other is dominant \u2192 3/4.\n3. Plain Red (PR): When the pigment is present (C) and color is recessive \u2192 1/2.\n4. Plain Brown (PB): When both genes are dominant \u2192 1/4.\n\nWait, but let's clarify:\n\nWait, CR is when both genes are recessive \u2192 1/4.\n\nCB is when at least one recessive pigment and at least one dominant color \u2192 3/4.\n\nPR is when pigment is present (at least one C) and color is recessive (bb) \u2192 1/2.\n\nPB is when pigment is present and color is present \u2192 1/4.\n\nNow, applying these frequencies:\n\n- CR: 25%\n- CB: 75%\n- PR: 50%\n- PB: 25%\n\nIf we want to express these as counts, assuming a large population:\n\n- CR: 25% \u2192 25 out of 100\n- CB: 75% \u2192 75\n- PR: 50% \u2192 50\n- PB: 25% \u2192 25\n\nAdding these up: 25 + 75 + 50 + 25 = 175, which is still off. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nActually, the correct way is to recognize that in a dihybrid cross with independent genes, the phenotypic ratio is typically 9:3:3:1, but in this case, since both genes are working together, the phenotypes may not follow that exact ratio. Instead, each phenotype corresponds to specific combinations.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the correct approach is to assign each possible genotype to a phenotype and then sum accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to ignore the interaction and treat each gene separately, leading to a ratio like 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype, but that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the number of birds in each phenotype based on the possible genotypes and their associated phenotypes.\n\nLet's list each bird's genotype and phenotype:\n\n1. **CC BB**: Checkered Red\n2. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown\n3. **CC bb**: Plain Red\n4. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n5. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n6. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n7. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n8. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n9. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n10. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n11. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n12. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n13. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n14. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n15. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n16. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n17. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n18. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n19. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n20. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n21. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n22. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n23. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n24. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n25. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n26. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n27. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n28. **CC BB**: Checkered Red (same as 1)\n29. **CC Bb**: Checkered Brown (same as 2)\n30. **CC bb**: Plain Red (same as 3)\n\nWait, this approach isn't helping. Perhaps instead, I'll create a table listing each bird's genotype and phenotype:\n\n1. **BB**: Not possible, since CC is the only genotype for B.\n2. **Bb**: Not possible, since CC is the only genotype for B.\n3. **bb**: Possible, leading to plain brown.\n4. **BB**: Same as above.\n5. **Bb**: Same as above.\n6. **bb**: As above.\n7. **BB**: As above.\n8. **Bb**: As above.\n9. **bb**: As above.\n10. **BB**: As above.\n\nThis approach is confusing. Maybe it's better to list each bird's genotype and phenotype:\n\nBird | Genotype | Phenotype\n--- | --- | ---\n1 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n2 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n3 | CC bb | Plain Red\n4 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n5 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n6 | CC bb | Plain Red\n7 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n8 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n9 | CC bb | Plain Red\n10 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n11 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n12 | CC bb | Plain Red\n13 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n14 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n15 | CC bb | Plain Red\n16 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n17 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n18 | CC bb | Plain Red\n19 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n20 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n21 | CC bb | Plain Red\n22 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n23 | CC Bb | Checkered Brown\n24 | CC bb | Plain Red\n25 | CC BB | Checkered Red\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- **Checkered Red (CR)**: Rows 1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22 \u2192 8 birds\n- **Checkered Brown (CB)**: Rows 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23 \u2192 8 birds\n- **Plain Red (PR)**: Rows 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24 \u2192 8 birds\n- **Plain Brown (PB)**: Rows 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24 \u2192 8 birds\n\nWait, that adds up to 32, which is inconsistent with a dihybrid cross expecting 16. I think I miscounted.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nFrom the table, each row represents a bird. Let's go through each bird:\n\n1. CR \u2192 1\n2. CB \u2192 2\n3. PR \u2192 3\n4. CR \u2192 4\n5.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant and B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nBut let me clarify the actual phenotypes:\n\n- C is dominant (so Cc or CC) \u2192 Pigment is red.\n- B is dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 Body color is brown.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 Red-brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 Plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the alleles from both genes. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant, red): 3/4 (since CC and Cc)\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown): 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered): 1/4\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1.

Both recessive: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain-checkered\n\nWait, but wait\u2014that doesn't seem right. Because the possible combinations should add up to 1. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal probability:\n\n- Red-brown: 9/16\n- Red-checkered: 3/16\n- Plain-brown: 3/16\n- Plain-checkered: 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 \u2192 Correct. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, option H says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That doesn't match what I have here. Option G says: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" Also incorrect. Option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 that seems off because our calculation shows Plain-brown as 3/16, which is less than 9/16. Option A: \"6, 2, 6, 2\" \u2013 that adds up to 16, but the numbers don't align. Option D: \"1, 3, 9, 3\" \u2013 adding to 16, but the order is different. Option J: \"2, 6, 3, 1\" \u2013 no, that doesn't fit. Option F: \"4,4,4,4\" \u2013 that's 16, but our calculation is 9:3:3:1. Option C: \"12,2,2,0\" \u2013 that's way higher. Option B: \"8,4,0,4\" \u2013 nope. Option I: \"7,5,1,3\" \u2013 no. Option H: \"5,3,2,6\" \u2013 no. Option G: \"12,2,2,0\" \u2013 same as before. Option E: \"3,9,1,3\" \u2013 no, because our calculation is 9:3:3:1, which is 9,3,3,1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. The phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nBut none of the options exactly match that. Let me look again:\n\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nNo, that's not matching.\n\nOption G: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\n\nNo.\n\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nThat would mean checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, which sums to 12, but according to my calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. So option E isn't correct either.\n\nHmm, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So perhaps the F2 refers to the results after two generations, not the entire population. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F2 generation, which would involve the F1 being crossed with itself.\n\nWait, the original question was about an adi hybrid cross involving a homozygous red bird and a plain brown bird. The user then asked about the F2 generation. They might have meant that the F2 is the F1 selfed again, leading to the next generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation resulting from crossing the F1 with another F1, i.e., the F2 is the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, which would indeed be the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that, the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio, as I calculated. So looking back at the options, none directly match this except possibly if I miscalculated somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the genes' dominance.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The problem states:\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- B is dominant (brown)\n\nSo, for pigment color, the dominant allele C leads to red, and recessive c leads to plain. For body color, dominant B leads to brown, recessive b leads to checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are indeed as I thought: 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2014 Not matching.\n\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2014 This matches my 9:3:3:1, but arranged differently. So checkered brown is 9, checkered red is 3. But in the options, checkered red comes first. So perhaps the letters correspond differently. Let me see how the options are structured.\n\nEach option lists four values: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. In the correct ratio, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, plain brown is 1. None of the options list these exactly, but option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". If the order matters, perhaps E is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should consider the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without relying solely on probabilities.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at a 25% rate. When forming F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (all C)\n- 25% Cc (C and c)\n- 25% cc (all c)\n- 25% BB (all B)\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s better to think of it as four possibilities for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: C/C, C/c, cc\nFor the B locus: B/B, Bb, bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the total combinations are 3\u00d73=9. However, considering dominance, some phenotypes may overlap. Wait, no\u2014the dominance applies to the phenotype, not the genotype. So regardless of the genotype, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it'll display the corresponding phenotype.\n\nWait, but actually, in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red, brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Pigment plain, brown\n4. Both recessive: Pigment plain, checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each class are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene's dominance.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- For C: 25% C (dominant, red), 25% c (recessive, plain)\n- For B: 25% B (dominant, brown), 25% b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. C and B dominant: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n4. Both recessive: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n\nWait, but that sums to 25%, which isn't possible because the sum should be 100%. Hmm, I must be making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe correct way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to consider all possible genotypes and map their phenotypes. For the F2 generation:\n\nPossible genotypes for each gene:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- For B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nWhen combined, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nBut many of these will result in the same phenotype. Let's categorize them:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C dominant, B dominant):\n- CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 These are the cases where both C and B are dominant.\nNumber of such genotypes: 4 \u2192 Phenotype count: 4\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive):\n- CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 genotypes \u2192 Phenotype count: 2\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant):\n- cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 genotypes \u2192 Phenotype count: 2\n\nPhenotype 4: Pigment plain and checkered (C recessive, B recessive):\n- cc bb \u2192 1 genotype \u2192 Phenotype count: 1\n\nTotal phenotypic classes: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9, which makes sense because 3^2 = 9 possible phenotype combinations (but some combine into fewer due to dominance).\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the sum of the probabilities of each genotype that leads to that phenotype.\n\nProbability for Phenotype 1 (C and B dominant):\n\nEach of the 4 genotypes has a probability of (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. So total probability: 4*(1/16)=4/16=1/4=25%.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Phenotype 2 (C dominant, B recessive): 2 genotypes, each 1/16 \u2192 2/16=1/8=12.5%\n- Phenotype 3 (C recessive, B dominant): 2 genotypes, each 1/16 \u2192 2/16=1/8=12.5%\n- Phenotype 4 (C recessive, B recessive): 1 genotype, 1/16=6.25%\n\nWait, but adding these percentages: 25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 56.25%, which is less than 100%. This indicates that I'm missing something. Oh, because some genotypes lead to the same phenotype, but the percentages shouldn't exceed 100%. Maybe I should consider the actual counts instead of probabilities.\n\nLet's take a sample of 16 birds (the least common denominator of the denominators 4, 8, 8, 1):\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 birds (25%)\n- Phenotype 2: 2 birds (12.5%)\n- Phenotype 3: 2 birds (12.5%)\n- Phenotype 4: 1 bird (6.25%)\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 birds, which accounts for 100% (since 4/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 1/16 = 9/16, but this is inconsistent). I think I'm getting confused with probabilities versus actual counts. Let me approach it differently by counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C and B dominant): All individuals where both parents contribute a dominant allele. From the F2 generation, this includes:\n\n  - CC BB: 1 bird\n  - CC Bb: 2 birds\n  - Cc BB: 2 birds\n  - Cc Bb: 4 birds\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm complicating things. Instead, let me use the Punnett square approach for the F2 generation. The F1 (CcBb) selfs, producing F2.\n\nThe possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb (each at 25% chance). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% BB (from Bb x Bb)\n- 25% Bb (from Bb x bB)\n- 25% bb (from bB x bb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc BB: Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- BB Bb: Pigment brown, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- BB bb: Pigment brown, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Bb Bb: Pigment brown, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Bb bb: Pigment plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb bb: Pigment plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. For example, a bird with genotype CC bb would have pigment red (C dominant) and plain (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype 3 (Pigment plain, checkered). Similarly, a bird with genotype cc BB would have pigment plain (c recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Pigment brown, checkered).\n\nSo now, let's categorize all F2 genotypes into their respective phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. BB Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n6. BB bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. Bb Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n8. Bb bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. bb bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 birds (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Phenotype 2: 3 birds (BB Bb, BB bb, Bb Bb)\n- Phenotype 3: 2 birds (Bb bb, bb bb)\n- Phenotype 4: 0 birds\n\nWait, that totals 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 birds, which accounts for all F2 individuals. But according to the previous probability approach, Phenotype 1 should be 25%, which is 4 out of 16, but here we have 4 out of 9. That inconsistency suggests a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 1 bird\n2. CC Bb \u2192 2 birds (because each gamete from CB and cb contributes to Bb)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to think in terms of the Punnett square cells. Each cell represents a unique combination. So from the Punnett square, each cell is a possible genotype for the F2 generation. So, in the F2 grid, the phenotypes are as follows:\n\nLooking at the F2 grid:\n\n```\n       | Cc    | Cc    |\n       -----------------\n       | CC    | Cc     | \n       | CB    | Cb     | \n       -----------------\n       | CB    | Cb     | \n       | cb    | cb     | \n```\n\nWait, no\u2014the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 would have the following genotypes:\n\nRows represent F1 (each bird) and columns also represent F1. Each cell is the combination of a row and column.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Row 1 (Cc): Gametes CB and cb\n- Column 1 (Cc): Gametes CB and cb\n\nSo, the top-left cell (C C) would be CC x Cc \u2192 but wait, the F1 is CcBb, so the gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me create the Punnett square properly.\n\nEach parent is CcBb. So each parent can produce four gametes:",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant and B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nBut let me clarify the actual phenotypes:\n\n- C is dominant (so Cc or CC) \u2192 Pigment is red.\n- B is dominant (BB or Bb) \u2192 Body color is brown.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 Red-brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 Plain-checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the alleles from both genes. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant, red): 3/4 (since CC and Cc)\n- Probability of c (recessive, plain): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (dominant, brown): 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive, checkered): 1/4\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Red-brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Red-checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain-brown\n4. Both recessive: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain-checkered\n\nWait, but wait\u2014that doesn't seem right. Because the possible combinations should add up to 1. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal probability:\n\n- Red-brown: 9/16\n- Red-checkered: 3/16\n- Plain-brown: 3/16\n- Plain-checkered: 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 \u2192 Correct. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given, option H says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That doesn't match what I have here. Option G says: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0.\" Also incorrect. Option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2013 that seems off because our calculation shows Plain-brown as 3/16, which is less than 9/16. Option A: \"6, 2, 6, 2\" \u2013 that adds up to 16, but the numbers don't align. Option D: \"1, 3, 9, 3\" \u2013 adding to 16, but the order is different. Option J: \"2, 6, 3, 1\" \u2013 no, that doesn't fit. Option F: \"4,4,4,4\" \u2013 that's 16, but our calculation is 9:3:3:1. Option C: \"12,2,2,0\" \u2013 that's way higher. Option B: \"8,4,0,4\" \u2013 nope. Option I: \"7,5,1,3\" \u2013 no. Option H: \"5,3,2,6\" \u2013 no. Option G: \"12,2,2,0\" \u2013 same as before. Option E: \"3,9,1,3\" \u2013 no, because our calculation is 9:3:3:1, which is 9,3,3,1.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. The phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, meaning:\n\n- Checkered red: 9 parts\n- Checkered brown: 3 parts\n- Plain red: 3 parts\n- Plain brown: 1 part\n\nBut none of the options exactly match that. Let me look again:\n\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nNo, that's not matching.\n\nOption G: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\n\nNo.\n\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\"\n\nThat would mean checkered red:3, checkered brown:9, which sums to 12, but according to my calculation, it should be 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. So option E isn't correct either.\n\nHmm, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So perhaps the F2 refers to the results after two generations, not the entire population. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F2 generation, which would involve the F1 being crossed with itself.\n\nWait, the original question was about an adi hybrid cross involving a homozygous red bird and a plain brown bird. The user then asked about the F2 generation. They might have meant that the F2 is the F1 selfed again, leading to the next generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation resulting from crossing the F1 with another F1, i.e., the F2 is the result of F1 \u00d7 F1, which would indeed be the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that, the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio, as I calculated. So looking back at the options, none directly match this except possibly if I miscalculated somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the genes' dominance.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The problem states:\n\n- C is dominant (red)\n- B is dominant (brown)\n\nSo, for pigment color, the dominant allele C leads to red, and recessive c leads to plain. For body color, dominant B leads to brown, recessive b leads to checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are indeed as I thought: 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2014 Not matching.\n\nOption E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2014 This matches my 9:3:3:1, but arranged differently. So checkered brown is 9, checkered red is 3. But in the options, checkered red comes first. So perhaps the letters correspond differently. Let me see how the options are structured.\n\nEach option lists four values: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. In the correct ratio, checkered red is 9, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, plain brown is 1. None of the options list these exactly, but option E is \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\". If the order matters, perhaps E is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratio.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps I should consider the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without relying solely on probabilities.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at a 25% rate. When forming F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (all C)\n- 25% Cc (C and c)\n- 25% cc (all c)\n- 25% BB (all B)\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nWait, no\u2014it\u2019s better to think of it as four possibilities for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: C/C, C/c, cc\nFor the B locus: B/B, Bb, bb\n\nSince the genes are independent, the total combinations are 3\u00d73=9. However, considering dominance, some phenotypes may overlap. Wait, no\u2014the dominance applies to the phenotype, not the genotype. So regardless of the genotype, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it'll display the corresponding phenotype.\n\nWait, but actually, in the F2 generation, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: Pigment red, brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigment red, checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Pigment plain, brown\n4. Both recessive: Pigment plain, checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each class are calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene's dominance.\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- For C: 25% C (dominant, red), 25% c (recessive, plain)\n- For B: 25% B (dominant, brown), 25% b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. C and B dominant: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n4. Both recessive: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n\nWait, but that sums to 25%, which isn't possible because the sum should be 100%. Hmm, I must be making a mistake here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe correct way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to consider all possible genotypes and map their phenotypes. For the F2 generation:\n\nPossible genotypes for each gene:\n\n- For C: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- For B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nWhen combined, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nBut many of these will result in the same phenotype. Let's categorize them:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C dominant, B dominant):\n- CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 These are the cases where both C and B are dominant.\nNumber of such genotypes: 4 \u2192 Phenotype count: 4\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive):\n- CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 genotypes \u2192 Phenotype count: 2\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant):\n- cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 genotypes \u2192 Phenotype count: 2\n\nPhenotype 4: Pigment plain and checkered (C recessive, B recessive):\n- cc bb \u2192 1 genotype \u2192 Phenotype count: 1\n\nTotal phenotypic classes: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9, which makes sense because 3^2 = 9 possible phenotype combinations (but some combine into fewer due to dominance).\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is the sum of the probabilities of each genotype that leads to that phenotype.\n\nProbability for Phenotype 1 (C and B dominant):\n\nEach of the 4 genotypes has a probability of (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16. So total probability: 4*(1/16)=4/16=1/4=25%.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- Phenotype 2 (C dominant, B recessive): 2 genotypes, each 1/16 \u2192 2/16=1/8=12.5%\n- Phenotype 3 (C recessive, B dominant): 2 genotypes, each 1/16 \u2192 2/16=1/8=12.5%\n- Phenotype 4 (C recessive, B recessive): 1 genotype, 1/16=6.25%\n\nWait, but adding these percentages: 25% + 12.5% + 12.5% + 6.25% = 56.25%, which is less than 100%. This indicates that I'm missing something. Oh, because some genotypes lead to the same phenotype, but the percentages shouldn't exceed 100%. Maybe I should consider the actual counts instead of probabilities.\n\nLet's take a sample of 16 birds (the least common denominator of the denominators 4, 8, 8, 1):\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 birds (25%)\n- Phenotype 2: 2 birds (12.5%)\n- Phenotype 3: 2 birds (12.5%)\n- Phenotype 4: 1 bird (6.25%)\n\nTotal: 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 birds, which accounts for 100% (since 4/16 + 2/16 + 2/16 + 1/16 = 9/16, but this is inconsistent). I think I'm getting confused with probabilities versus actual counts. Let me approach it differently by counting the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C and B dominant): All individuals where both parents contribute a dominant allele. From the F2 generation, this includes:\n\n  - CC BB: 1 bird\n  - CC Bb: 2 birds\n  - Cc BB: 2 birds\n  - Cc Bb: 4 birds\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm complicating things. Instead, let me use the Punnett square approach for the F2 generation. The F1 (CcBb) selfs, producing F2.\n\nThe possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb (each at 25% chance). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% BB (from Bb x Bb)\n- 25% Bb (from Bb x bB)\n- 25% bb (from bB x bb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CC Bb: Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc BB: Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- BB Bb: Pigment brown, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- BB bb: Pigment brown, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Bb Bb: Pigment brown, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Bb bb: Pigment plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb bb: Pigment plain, checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. For example, a bird with genotype CC bb would have pigment red (C dominant) and plain (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype 3 (Pigment plain, checkered). Similarly, a bird with genotype cc BB would have pigment plain (c recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype 2 (Pigment brown, checkered).\n\nSo now, let's categorize all F2 genotypes into their respective phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. BB Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n6. BB bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. Bb Bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n8. Bb bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. bb bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n\nCounting each:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 4 birds (CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\n- Phenotype 2: 3 birds (BB Bb, BB bb, Bb Bb)\n- Phenotype 3: 2 birds (Bb bb, bb bb)\n- Phenotype 4: 0 birds\n\nWait, that totals 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 birds, which accounts for all F2 individuals. But according to the previous probability approach, Phenotype 1 should be 25%, which is 4 out of 16, but here we have 4 out of 9. That inconsistency suggests a mistake in counting. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 1 bird\n2. CC Bb \u2192 2 birds (because each gamete from CB and cb contributes to Bb)\nWait, no\u2014it's better to think in terms of the Punnett square cells. Each cell represents a unique combination. So from the Punnett square, each cell is a possible genotype for the F2 generation. So, in the F2 grid, the phenotypes are as follows:\n\nLooking at the F2 grid:\n\n```\n       | Cc    | Cc    |\n       -----------------\n       | CC    | Cc     | \n       | CB    | Cb     | \n       -----------------\n       | CB    | Cb     | \n       | cb    | cb     | \n```\n\nWait, no\u2014the Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 would have the following genotypes:\n\nRows represent F1 (each bird) and columns also represent F1. Each cell is the combination of a row and column.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Row 1 (Cc): Gametes CB and cb\n- Column 1 (Cc): Gametes CB and cb\n\nSo, the top-left cell (C C) would be CC x Cc \u2192 but wait, the F1 is CcBb, so the gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me create the Punnett square properly.\n\nEach parent is CcBb. So each parent can produce four gametes:",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, no. Actually, the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. So:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- If at least one C allele, the bird is red.\n- Only c, plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n- If at least one B allele, the bird is brown.\n- Only b, checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations where each gene contributes either dominant or recessive. Thus, there are 2\u00d72=4 possible phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype can be found by calculating the probability for each gene and then combining them since the genes are independent.\n\nProbability of pigment red (C is dominant) = 75% (since only cc is recessive)\nProbability of body brown (B dominant) = 75%\nBut wait, no\u2014the overall phenotype isn't just the product of each gene's probability because each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So the combined probability is (75% for C) * (75% for B) = 56.25%, but this doesn't directly translate to the number of birds. Instead, we calculate the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nLet's consider each combination:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B): Probability = (Probability of C being present) \u00d7 (Probability of B being present) = (3/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b): (3/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B): (1/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b): (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 \u2192 100%.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nSo four possible phenotypes. Now, what's the probability of each? Let's calculate:\n\nFor the C locus: \n- Probability of C (C_: 50%) and B (B_: 50%) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Probability of C (C_) and b (b_: 50%) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Probability of c (c_: 50%) and B \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Probability of c (c_: 50%) and b \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nWait, but hold on. The actual calculation depends on whether the genes assort independently and under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In this case, the parents are homozygous for both genes, leading to a dihybrid cross.\n\nBut the user has already given a complete Punnett square, so perhaps they've already accounted for the probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to use the standard dihybrid cross approach without looking at the specific parents' genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is misstated, and the parents are different. Wait, let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo each bird has two genes: C (pigenmuting) and B (color). The phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_ (Red Brown)\n2. C_b_ (Red Checkered)\n3. c_BB (Plain Brown)\n4. c_bb (Plain Checkered)\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. As each gene is segregating independently, the probabilities for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- C_: 50%\n- c_: 50%\n\nFor B (color):\n- B_: 50%\n- b_: 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for any phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but weighted according to the number of combinations that lead to each phenotype. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because some combinations might overlap differently. Actually, each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes. So each phenotype is represented by one of the four possible combinations.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but wait, that's not exactly accurate because each combination leads to a distinct phenotype. So the ratio should reflect how many birds fall into each phenotype category. \n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_): This occurs when both C and B are dominant. The probability is (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%.\n2. Red Checkered (C_b_): C dominant, B recessive. Probability: 25%.\n3. Plain Brown (c_BB): c recessive, B dominant. 25%.\n4. Plain Checkered (c_bb): Both recessive. 25%.\n\nSo each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options provided, none seem to match that directly. Wait, let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions A through H are various ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming independence, but perhaps the genes aren't independent, or there's another factor. Alternatively, perhaps the question isn't about phenotypic ratios but about other aspects like genotypic or observable ratios. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that each bird has two separate traits, but the phenotypic ratios are considered as phenotypic classes rather than as separate combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which considers all observable traits together. So if each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio would consider the counts of each possible combination of those traits. So, in this case, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match that. Wait, perhaps the options are presented in terms of observed counts, not percentages. For example, in a 100 bird population, 25 would be each phenotype. But the options don't seem to include that either.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which doesn't make sense because F2 usually includes 3^2 =9 possible genotypic combinations, but phenotypically, each could have multiple. Wait, no\u2014it's not about genotypes but about the number of birds in each phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of numbers, not percentages. So if the F2 population is 16 birds (since F1 is 2, F2 is 4, but starting from F1 x F1, it's 16?), then perhaps the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, but that's not matching any option. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the genes are not independent.\n\nWait, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 is CcBb. The F2 would come from F1 selfing, resulting in 9 possible genotypes, but phenotypically, each may combine into different phenotypes. However, since both genes are fully dominant (C and B), every bird will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, making all birds have at least one dominant trait. So, the phenotypes would exclude the 'plain' phenotype entirely, except for the 'checkered' phenotype, which combines both recessive alleles. Wait, that makes sense because the parents are CC BB (so at least one dominant allele for both genes) and cc bb (at least one recessive allele for both genes). So when crossed, all F1 (CcBb) will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, hence all F2 will have at least one dominant trait, except perhaps in cases where the genes are not expressed. But since the question mentions both genes, all F2 birds will have either red or brown or checkered or plain. But wait, in reality, if a bird has C_, it's red, and if B_, it's brown, regardless of the other gene. So, for the F2, all birds will have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C_), so they'll be red or brown. Similarly, all birds will have at least one dominant allele for color (B_), so they'll be brown or checkered. Therefore, the only possible phenotypes are red or brown, combined with checkered or plain. Wait, but in reality, if a bird is red and brown, that's one phenotype, red and checkered, another, plain and brown, third, and plain and checkered, fourth. So four phenotypes. But in this case, since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, all F1 (CcBb) will have at least one dominant allele for both genes, so all F2 will also have at least one dominant allele for both genes. Therefore, all F2 birds will be either red or brown, and either checkered or plain. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combinations of these two.\n\nIn such a scenario, each bird will have one of four possible phenotypes, but due to the dominance, some combinations won't occur. For example, a bird cannot be both plain and brown because both B and b are recessive, which requires both alleles to be recessive. But since all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and color brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and color checkered (C_b_)\n3. Pigment plain and color brown (c_BB)\n4. Pigment plain and color checkered (c_bb)\n\nEach of these four phenotypes is possible. Now, the probabilities for each:\n\nFor pigment (C/B):\n\n- C_: 50%\n- c_: 50%\n\nFor color (B/b):\n\n- B_: 50%\n- b_: 50%\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are 25% for each phenotype. Therefore, each phenotype would account for 25% of the F2 population. If we assume a large enough F2 population, say 100 birds, 25 would be each phenotype. However, the options provided don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, let's look at the options again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let's recalculate the probabilities. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each gene segregates independently. The probability of each combination is:\n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n- C_ : 0.5\n- c_ : 0.5\n\nFor color (B/b):\n- B_ : 0.5\n- b_ : 0.5\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_ : (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n2. C_b_ : (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n3. c_BB : (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n4. c_bb : (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n\nTherefore, each phenotype accounts for 25% of the F2 population. If the question is referring to the number of birds in each phenotype class, then in a population of 16 birds (which is 4^2), each phenotype would have 4 birds (16/4=4). So:\n\nCheckered red: 4 birds\nCheckered brown: 4 birds\nPlain red: 4 birds\nPlain brown: 4 birds\n\nBut none of the options seem to match this. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, but the distribution is skewed, which doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Again, not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Not matching.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of observable traits, not accounting for the dominance. For instance, in the case where both C and B are required for a particular trait, but if a bird has only one, it may display a different phenotype. However, in this case, all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so they all express both traits, making all four phenotypes possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the parents are homozygous for both genes, leading to a certain outcome. Let me try calculating the F2 generation manually.\n\nFirst, F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cb, and cb (assuming equal segregation). So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% cBBb\n- 25% ccBB\n\nWait, no, more accurately, each F1 gamete (CB, cb, cb, cb) combines with another gamete. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc BB\n\nAnd similarly for the other combinations. So the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Correctly, each F1 gamete can pair with any other, leading to the following:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc BB\n\nSimilarly, considering all pairs, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: (CB \u00d7 CB) \u2192 25%\n- CcBb: (CB \u00d7 cb) + (cb \u00d7 CB) \u2192 50%\n- cc BB: (cb \u00d7 cb) \u2192 25%\n\nAdditionally, considering the reverse:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: same as above\n- cb \u00d7 CB: same as above\n- cb \u00d7 cb: same as above\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CcBb\n- 25% cc BB\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Color brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CcBb: Pigment red, Color checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB: Pigment plain, Color brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc bb: Pigment plain, Color checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the number of each genotype. Assuming 100 individuals, the distribution would be 25% each for the three phenotypes (excluding cc BB, which would be plain and brown). Wait, no\u2014CC BB would be red and brown, CcBb is red and checkered, cc BB is plain and brown, and cc bb is plain and checkered. All four phenotypes are possible.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, the highest proportion seems to be option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio. Wait, but that's similar to a chi-square test where one variable is dominant and another is recessive. Perhaps the question is considering only one trait at a time, but that doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is treating each gene separately, and thus, the phenotypic ratios would sum accordingly. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option E, where checkered red and checkered brown are the most common, followed by plain red and plain brown being less frequent. But my calculations suggest a 25% each for all four phenotypes, unless there's an error in the way the gametes are formed.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue lies in the assumption that all F2 genotypes are equally likely, but in reality, some genotypes may not be viable or may not appear due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, the question specifies dihybrid crosses and dihybrid relationships, implying that all possible combinations are considered.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option E, where the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is typical for two loci with independent dominance. But that would require the phenotypes to be grouped differently, perhaps considering dominance within each trait. However, in this case, since both traits are influenced by the same genes, grouping them might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one trait at a time, but that contradicts the description of dihybrid inheritance. Given the options, the most plausible choice based on the dihybrid expectation is that each phenotype has an equal chance, but that's not among the options. Option D has a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which doesn't match our expectations.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the correct phenotypic ratio, based on the assumption that all four phenotypes are equally likely, is 25:25:25:25. However, since this isn't an option, I must revisit the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of the dominant alleles, ignoring the recessive ones. So for pigment, any dominant allele (C) results in red, and any dominant color allele (B) results in brown. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red: presence of C or B (all phenotypes except plain)\n- Pigment plain: presence of c and b (only the last phenotype)\n\nSimilarly, for color:\n\n- Brown: presence of B\n- Checkered: presence of b\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Pigment plain and Brown\n4. Pigment plain and Checkered\n\nEach of these is possible, but depending on the dominance, some combinations may not occur. However, in reality, all four phenotypes are possible because the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene ensures expression of both traits.\n\nGiven this, the phenotypic ratio would still be 25% each, but none of the options reflect this. The closest option that reflects a 1:3:9:3 ratio is option D, which lists 1,3,9,3. But that doesn't match our calculations.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer, based on the dihybrid cross, would result in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but since that's not an option, I must conclude that the intended answer is option D, where the checkered red and checkered brown are the majority, followed by plain red and plain brown being fewer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is a common Mendelian ratio for two traits, but that's not applicable here since both traits are influenced by the same genes. Without further clarification, I'm inclined to choose option D as the best fit despite the mismatch in reasoning.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nSo four possible phenotypes. Now, what's the probability of each? Let's calculate:\n\nFor the C locus: \n- Probability of C (C_: 50%) and B (B_: 50%) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Probability of C (C_) and b (b_: 50%) \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Probability of c (c_: 50%) and B \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n- Probability of c (c_: 50%) and b \u2192 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nWait, but hold on. The actual calculation depends on whether the genes assort independently and under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In this case, the parents are homozygous for both genes, leading to a dihybrid cross.\n\nBut the user has already given a complete Punnett square, so perhaps they've already accounted for the probabilities. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting us to use the standard dihybrid cross approach without looking at the specific parents' genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is misstated, and the parents are different. Wait, let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo each bird has two genes: C (pigenmuting) and B (color). The phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_ (Red Brown)\n2. C_b_ (Red Checkered)\n3. c_BB (Plain Brown)\n4. c_bb (Plain Checkered)\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. As each gene is segregating independently, the probabilities for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- C_: 50%\n- c_: 50%\n\nFor B (color):\n- B_: 50%\n- b_: 50%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for any phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but weighted according to the number of combinations that lead to each phenotype. Wait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because some combinations might overlap differently. Actually, each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of dominant and recessive alleles for both genes. So each phenotype is represented by one of the four possible combinations.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but wait, that's not exactly accurate because each combination leads to a distinct phenotype. So the ratio should reflect how many birds fall into each phenotype category. \n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. Red Brown (C_B_): This occurs when both C and B are dominant. The probability is (0.5 * 0.5) = 25%.\n2. Red Checkered (C_b_): C dominant, B recessive. Probability: 25%.\n3. Plain Brown (c_BB): c recessive, B dominant. 25%.\n4. Plain Checkered (c_bb): Both recessive. 25%.\n\nSo each phenotype accounts for 25% of the population. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But looking at the options provided, none seem to match that directly. Wait, let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions A through H are various ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming independence, but perhaps the genes aren't independent, or there's another factor. Alternatively, perhaps the question isn't about phenotypic ratios but about other aspects like genotypic or observable ratios. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that each bird has two separate traits, but the phenotypic ratios are considered as phenotypic classes rather than as separate combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, which considers all observable traits together. So if each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio would consider the counts of each possible combination of those traits. So, in this case, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options match that. Wait, perhaps the options are presented in terms of observed counts, not percentages. For example, in a 100 bird population, 25 would be each phenotype. But the options don't seem to include that either.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 1+3+9+3=16, which doesn't make sense because F2 usually includes 3^2 =9 possible genotypic combinations, but phenotypically, each could have multiple. Wait, no\u2014it's not about genotypes but about the number of birds in each phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of numbers, not percentages. So if the F2 population is 16 birds (since F1 is 2, F2 is 4, but starting from F1 x F1, it's 16?), then perhaps the ratio would be 4:4:4:4, but that's not matching any option. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong, and the genes are not independent.\n\nWait, but the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So the F1 is CcBb. The F2 would come from F1 selfing, resulting in 9 possible genotypes, but phenotypically, each may combine into different phenotypes. However, since both genes are fully dominant (C and B), every bird will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, making all birds have at least one dominant trait. So, the phenotypes would exclude the 'plain' phenotype entirely, except for the 'checkered' phenotype, which combines both recessive alleles. Wait, that makes sense because the parents are CC BB (so at least one dominant allele for both genes) and cc bb (at least one recessive allele for both genes). So when crossed, all F1 (CcBb) will have at least one dominant allele for each gene, hence all F2 will have at least one dominant trait, except perhaps in cases where the genes are not expressed. But since the question mentions both genes, all F2 birds will have either red or brown or checkered or plain. But wait, in reality, if a bird has C_, it's red, and if B_, it's brown, regardless of the other gene. So, for the F2, all birds will have at least one dominant allele for pigment (C_), so they'll be red or brown. Similarly, all birds will have at least one dominant allele for color (B_), so they'll be brown or checkered. Therefore, the only possible phenotypes are red or brown, combined with checkered or plain. Wait, but in reality, if a bird is red and brown, that's one phenotype, red and checkered, another, plain and brown, third, and plain and checkered, fourth. So four phenotypes. But in this case, since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, all F1 (CcBb) will have at least one dominant allele for both genes, so all F2 will also have at least one dominant allele for both genes. Therefore, all F2 birds will be either red or brown, and either checkered or plain. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combinations of these two.\n\nIn such a scenario, each bird will have one of four possible phenotypes, but due to the dominance, some combinations won't occur. For example, a bird cannot be both plain and brown because both B and b are recessive, which requires both alleles to be recessive. But since all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and color brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and color checkered (C_b_)\n3. Pigment plain and color brown (c_BB)\n4. Pigment plain and color checkered (c_bb)\n\nEach of these four phenotypes is possible. Now, the probabilities for each:\n\nFor pigment (C/B):\n\n- C_: 50%\n- c_: 50%\n\nFor color (B/b):\n\n- B_: 50%\n- b_: 50%\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are 25% for each phenotype. Therefore, each phenotype would account for 25% of the F2 population. If we assume a large enough F2 population, say 100 birds, 25 would be each phenotype. However, the options provided don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, let's look at the options again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let's recalculate the probabilities. The F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) selfing. Each gene segregates independently. The probability of each combination is:\n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n- C_ : 0.5\n- c_ : 0.5\n\nFor color (B/b):\n- B_ : 0.5\n- b_ : 0.5\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_ : (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n2. C_b_ : (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n3. c_BB : (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n4. c_bb : (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n\nTherefore, each phenotype accounts for 25% of the F2 population. If the question is referring to the number of birds in each phenotype class, then in a population of 16 birds (which is 4^2), each phenotype would have 4 birds (16/4=4). So:\n\nCheckered red: 4 birds\nCheckered brown: 4 birds\nPlain red: 4 birds\nPlain brown: 4 birds\n\nBut none of the options seem to match this. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, but the distribution is skewed, which doesn't align with our calculations.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Again, not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Not matching.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of observable traits, not accounting for the dominance. For instance, in the case where both C and B are required for a particular trait, but if a bird has only one, it may display a different phenotype. However, in this case, all F2 have at least one dominant allele for each gene, so they all express both traits, making all four phenotypes possible.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the parents are homozygous for both genes, leading to a certain outcome. Let me try calculating the F2 generation manually.\n\nFirst, F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cb, and cb (assuming equal segregation). So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% cBBb\n- 25% ccBB\n\nWait, no, more accurately, each F1 gamete (CB, cb, cb, cb) combines with another gamete. So the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc BB\n\nAnd similarly for the other combinations. So the actual F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n\nWait, that's incorrect. Correctly, each F1 gamete can pair with any other, leading to the following:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb: cc BB\n\nSimilarly, considering all pairs, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: (CB \u00d7 CB) \u2192 25%\n- CcBb: (CB \u00d7 cb) + (cb \u00d7 CB) \u2192 50%\n- cc BB: (cb \u00d7 cb) \u2192 25%\n\nAdditionally, considering the reverse:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB: same as above\n- cb \u00d7 CB: same as above\n- cb \u00d7 cb: same as above\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CcBb\n- 25% cc BB\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, Color brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- CcBb: Pigment red, Color checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc BB: Pigment plain, Color brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- cc bb: Pigment plain, Color checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the number of each genotype. Assuming 100 individuals, the distribution would be 25% each for the three phenotypes (excluding cc BB, which would be plain and brown). Wait, no\u2014CC BB would be red and brown, CcBb is red and checkered, cc BB is plain and brown, and cc bb is plain and checkered. All four phenotypes are possible.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, the highest proportion seems to be option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio. Wait, but that's similar to a chi-square test where one variable is dominant and another is recessive. Perhaps the question is considering only one trait at a time, but that doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is treating each gene separately, and thus, the phenotypic ratios would sum accordingly. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option E, where checkered red and checkered brown are the most common, followed by plain red and plain brown being less frequent. But my calculations suggest a 25% each for all four phenotypes, unless there's an error in the way the gametes are formed.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue lies in the assumption that all F2 genotypes are equally likely, but in reality, some genotypes may not be viable or may not appear due to incomplete dominance or other factors. However, the question specifies dihybrid crosses and dihybrid relationships, implying that all possible combinations are considered.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option E, where the phenotypic ratio is 3:9:1:3, which is typical for two loci with independent dominance. But that would require the phenotypes to be grouped differently, perhaps considering dominance within each trait. However, in this case, since both traits are influenced by the same genes, grouping them might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering only one trait at a time, but that contradicts the description of dihybrid inheritance. Given the options, the most plausible choice based on the dihybrid expectation is that each phenotype has an equal chance, but that's not among the options. Option D has a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which doesn't match our expectations.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the correct phenotypic ratio, based on the assumption that all four phenotypes are equally likely, is 25:25:25:25. However, since this isn't an option, I must revisit the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of the dominant alleles, ignoring the recessive ones. So for pigment, any dominant allele (C) results in red, and any dominant color allele (B) results in brown. Thus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red: presence of C or B (all phenotypes except plain)\n- Pigment plain: presence of c and b (only the last phenotype)\n\nSimilarly, for color:\n\n- Brown: presence of B\n- Checkered: presence of b\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Pigment plain and Brown\n4. Pigment plain and Checkered\n\nEach of these is possible, but depending on the dominance, some combinations may not occur. However, in reality, all four phenotypes are possible because the presence of at least one dominant allele for each gene ensures expression of both traits.\n\nGiven this, the phenotypic ratio would still be 25% each, but none of the options reflect this. The closest option that reflects a 1:3:9:3 ratio is option D, which lists 1,3,9,3. But that doesn't match our calculations.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer, based on the dihybrid cross, would result in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but since that's not an option, I must conclude that the intended answer is option D, where the checkered red and checkered brown are the majority, followed by plain red and plain brown being fewer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is a common Mendelian ratio for two traits, but that's not applicable here since both traits are influenced by the same genes. Without further clarification, I'm inclined to choose option D as the best fit despite the mismatch in reasoning.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B are both recessive)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For example:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then pigment is red.\n- If B is present (B_), then body is brown.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: red and brown \u2192 Checkered red-brown?\nWait, no\u2014the colors are checked, but the phenotype is a combination. Maybe better to say:\n\n- Checkered (c) and brown (B) \u2192 plain brown\n- Checkered (c) and red (C) \u2192 plain red\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Plain (c) and red (C) \u2192 checkered red\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant C allele, and plain by recessive c. The color is determined by B (dominant) and b (recessive). So the phenotype for each bird is determined by both genes. Therefore, each bird can have four possible phenotypes based on the presence/absence of C and B.\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype based on the genetic ratios. Since each gene is independently assorting, the phenotypic ratios can be found by calculating the probabilities of each combination.\n\nEach gene has two alleles, and the F2 generation follows a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene. However, since the two genes are linked or independent (but I don't know the linkage here), I'll assume they are independent. Therefore, the combined phenotypic ratio will be 4 (phenotypes) \u00d7 (probability of each gene).\n\nWait, no\u2014it's 2^2 = 4 phenotypic categories. But each category's probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate the probabilities for each gene first.\n\nFor Gene C (Pigment):\n\n- Probability of C (present) = 3/4 (since dominant)\n- Probability of c (absent) = 1/4\n\nFor Gene B (Color):\n\n- Probability of B (present) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (absent) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Now, the phenotypic categories are combinations of C/B and c/b. Let's list them:\n\n1. C_B: Pigment red (C present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered red-brown\n2. C_b: Pigment red (C present) and Checkered (B absent) \u2192 Checkered red\n3. c_B: Pigment plain (C absent) and Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c_b: Pigment plain (C absent) and Checkered (B absent) \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c. So if an animal has the c allele, regardless of B, it will have plain color. Similarly, if it has the B allele, regardless of c, it will have brown color.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered red-brown\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. C_B: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C_b: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. c_B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. c_b: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, the ratios are:\n\nCheckered red-brown : Checkered red : Checkered brown : Checkered plain = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nThis adds up to 16 parts, so 9+3+3+1=16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Not matching our calculation.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match my calculation. Did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me double-check. Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. For each bird:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered red-brown\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nThe probabilities are indeed 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16 respectively. Adding up to 16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't align with what I have. Option H mentions checkered red 5, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOptions A to J:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16. Hmm, 6+2+6+2=16, which matches. But the pheno ratio isn't 9:3:3:1.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16. Doesn't match.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, this matches.\n\nD. 1,3,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nSo option C seems to have the correct ratio: 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the phenotypic ratio being 9 checkered red-brown, 3 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, and 1 checkered plain. None of the options directly state 9:3:3:1, but option C does. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are labeled A to J, each giving different numbers. Looking back:\n\nOption C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This matches exactly with my calculation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B are both recessive)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because the phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For example:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then pigment is red.\n- If B is present (B_), then body is brown.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: red and brown \u2192 Checkered red-brown?\nWait, no\u2014the colors are checked, but the phenotype is a combination. Maybe better to say:\n\n- Checkered (c) and brown (B) \u2192 plain brown\n- Checkered (c) and red (C) \u2192 plain red\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown\n- Plain (c) and red (C) \u2192 checkered red\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant C allele, and plain by recessive c. The color is determined by B (dominant) and b (recessive). So the phenotype for each bird is determined by both genes. Therefore, each bird can have four possible phenotypes based on the presence/absence of C and B.\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each phenotype based on the genetic ratios. Since each gene is independently assorting, the phenotypic ratios can be found by calculating the probabilities of each combination.\n\nEach gene has two alleles, and the F2 generation follows a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene. However, since the two genes are linked or independent (but I don't know the linkage here), I'll assume they are independent. Therefore, the combined phenotypic ratio will be 4 (phenotypes) \u00d7 (probability of each gene).\n\nWait, no\u2014it's 2^2 = 4 phenotypic categories. But each category's probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let's calculate the probabilities for each gene first.\n\nFor Gene C (Pigment):\n\n- Probability of C (present) = 3/4 (since dominant)\n- Probability of c (absent) = 1/4\n\nFor Gene B (Color):\n\n- Probability of B (present) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (absent) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Now, the phenotypic categories are combinations of C/B and c/b. Let's list them:\n\n1. C_B: Pigment red (C present) and Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered red-brown\n2. C_b: Pigment red (C present) and Checkered (B absent) \u2192 Checkered red\n3. c_B: Pigment plain (C absent) and Brown (B present) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. c_b: Pigment plain (C absent) and Checkered (B absent) \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem states that the checkered pattern is determined by the recessive allele c. So if an animal has the c allele, regardless of B, it will have plain color. Similarly, if it has the B allele, regardless of c, it will have brown color.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are determined as follows:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered red-brown\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nNow, the probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. C_B: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C_b: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. c_B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. c_b: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, the ratios are:\n\nCheckered red-brown : Checkered red : Checkered brown : Checkered plain = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nThis adds up to 16 parts, so 9+3+3+1=16. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption H: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Not matching our calculation.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 No.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match my calculation. Did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me double-check. Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. For each bird:\n\n- If C is present and B is present \u2192 Checkered red-brown\n- If C is present and B is absent \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C is absent and B is present \u2192 Checkered brown\n- If C is absent and B is absent \u2192 Checkered plain\n\nThe probabilities are indeed 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16 respectively. Adding up to 16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That doesn't align with what I have. Option H mentions checkered red 5, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOptions A to J:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16. Hmm, 6+2+6+2=16, which matches. But the pheno ratio isn't 9:3:3:1.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16. Doesn't match.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, this matches.\n\nD. 1,3,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nSo option C seems to have the correct ratio: 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the phenotypic ratio being 9 checkered red-brown, 3 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, and 1 checkered plain. None of the options directly state 9:3:3:1, but option C does. Wait, let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are labeled A to J, each giving different numbers. Looking back:\n\nOption C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This matches exactly with my calculation. So option C is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (both c and b)\n\nWait, but let me clarify: the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to those phenotypes. So, for pigment color (C), presence is red, absence is plain. For body color (B), presence is brown, absence is checkered. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) and/or B is present (brown).\n\nSo the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n- Both C and B: red brown (if C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- C present, B absent: red checkered\n- C absent, B present: plain brown\n- Both C and B absent: plain checkered\n\nNow, given the parents: Parent 1 is CC BB (so both C and B are dominant). Parent 2 is cc bb (so both c and b are recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb because each gene follows Mendel's laws.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have four possible genotypes based on independent assortment. Each parent contributes either CB or cb gametes. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (CB + CB)\n- Cc (CB + cb)\n- cc (cb + cb)\n- bb (cb + cb)\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes, each of these would translate to specific combinations. Now, let's calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the number of each genotype:\n\n- CC: All red and brown \u2192 red brown (phenotype A)\n- Cc: Presence of C (red) and presence of B (brown) \u2192 red brown (same as above)\n- cc: All plain \u2192 plain (phenotype D)\n- bb: All checkered \u2192 checkered (phenotype C)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because each bird is determined by two traits, so the combination would be:\n\n- If a bird has C and B \u2192 red brown\n- If a bird has C and b \u2192 red checkered\n- If c and B \u2192 plain brown\n- If c and b \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo each bird has a unique combination of these. Now, when calculating the phenotypic ratio, we need to consider how many of each phenotype there are in the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 population consists of four types of birds based on their genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nEach of these corresponds to different phenotypes:\n\n- CC and Cc: both have C and B \u2192 red brown (A)\n- cc: c and b \u2192 plain (D)\n- cc and Cc: also have c and b \u2192 plain (D)\n\nWait, no\u2014it depends on whether a bird has any dominant alleles for each gene. For example, CC (presence of C and B) \u2192 red brown (A)\nCc (presence of C and B) \u2192 same as A\ncc (absence of both) \u2192 plain (D)\ncb (presence of c and B?) Wait, no, c is recessive for pigment, and B is dominant for color. So cb would mean c and B, which would be plain brown (since C is recessive, so the bird is plain, and B is present, so brown). Similarly, cc and cc \u2192 plain. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is cc, then it doesn't have pigment (c is recessive), regardless of the B gene. Similarly, if a bird is cc and B is present, it's plain checkered (C is recessive, b is recessive). Wait, no\u2014I might be getting confused here. Let me re-express:\n\nFor each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C present \u2192 red\n  - c absent \u2192 plain\n- For body (B):\n  - B present \u2192 brown\n  - b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Therefore, a bird's phenotype can be described by whether it has C (red) and/or B (brown):\n\n- Both C and B: red brown (A)\n- Only C and B: same as above (A)\n- Only C and b: red checkered (B)\n- Only c and B: plain brown (C)\n- Only c and b: plain checkered (D)\n- Both c and b: plain (D)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's actually:\n\n- If the bird has C (anywhere) and B (anywhere), it's red brown.\n- If the bird has C (anywhere) but not B, it's red checkered.\n- If the bird has c (not C) but has B, it's plain brown.\n- If the bird has neither C nor B, it's plain.\n- If the bird has neither C nor B, it's plain.\nWait, that seems off. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird is characterized by two traits: pigment color and body color.\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C: dominant \u2192 red\n  - c: recessive \u2192 plain\n- Body color (B):\n  - B: dominant \u2192 brown\n  - b: recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the bird's phenotype is a combination of these:\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 red brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 red checkered\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 plain brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, in the F2 generation, what proportion of the population will fall into each category?\n\nFrom the F2 generation, each bird has a certain genotype, which translates to certain phenotypes. The distribution of phenotypes is determined by the segregation of alleles during gamete formation.\n\nGiven that both parents are heterozygous (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), each parent will produce four types of gametes, but due to independent assortment, the actual gametes produced could vary. However, in reality, the F2 generation will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio under Mendelian inheritance. But in this case, since the genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio should reflect the product of the individual ratios for each gene.\n\nLet me calculate the probability for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (A)\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes.\nProbability = 1 - (probability of c and b)\nWhich is 1 - (1/4 * 1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered (B)\nThis occurs when the bird has C (for pigment) but not B (for body).\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (C)\nThis occurs when the bird has c (no pigment) but B (brown).\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8 = 0.125\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (D)\nThis occurs when the bird has neither C nor B.\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 = 0.0625\n\nWait, but adding up these probabilities: 15/16 + 4/16 + 2/16 + 1/16 = 22/16, which exceeds 1. That indicates an error in my calculation. Let me rethink.\n\nActually, the correct way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to consider the actual combinations of the two genes. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the phenotypic ratio should combine the probabilities accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. So the phenotypic ratio can be found by enumerating all possible combinations and determining their frequencies.\n\nThere are four possible genotypic combinations for each gene, leading to 16 possible phenotypic combinations, but many will overlap. However, considering dominance, some combinations may be grouped together.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to use the Punnett square approach for the F2 generation.\n\nSince both parents are CcBb, the F1 is CcBb. The F2 generation results from selfing F1, producing four F2 genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%).\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, B is brown \u2192 red brown (A)\n- Cc: Pigment red, B is brown \u2192 same as CC (A)\n- cc: Neither pigment nor brown \u2192 plain checkered (D)\n- cc: Same as above (D)\n\nWait, that can't be right because Cc also includes having C and B, which would still be red brown. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (pigment) and at least one B (body), it's red brown (A)\n- If the bird has at least one C but not B, it's red checkered (B)\n- If the bird has at least one B but not C, it's plain brown (C)\n- If the bird has neither C nor B, it's plain (D)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes correspond to the presence or absence of each dominant allele.\n\nNow, in the F2 generation:\n\n- 25% CC: both dominant \u2192 A\n- 50% Cc: presence of C but not B (since C is dominant and B is recessive) \u2192 A\n- 25% cc: both recessive \u2192 D\n\nAdditionally, within the Cc group, there are birds that might have B or not. Wait, no\u2014Cc means at least one C, but since B is recessive, none of them have B. So all Cc individuals are A. The cc individuals are D.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the F2, Cc and cc would each represent specific phenotypes. Let me list all possible combinations:\n\n- CC: A\n- Cc: A\n- cc: D\n- cc: D\n\nSo, overall, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- A: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- D: 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the presence of C and B affects the phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the actual number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird can have various genotypes, which translate to phenotypes. The number of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: Occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n- Phenotype B: Occurs when the bird has at least one C but no B.\n- Phenotype C: Occurs when the bird has at least one B but no C.\n- Phenotype D: Occurs when the bird has neither C nor B.\n\nTo count the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 100%.\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% (CC) + 50% (Cc) = 75%\n- Phenotype B: 50% (Cc)\n- Phenotype C: 25% (cc)\n- Phenotype D: 25% (cc)\n\nWait, that makes sense because:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 A\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 A\n- cc (25%) \u2192 D\n\nAnd within Cc, all have at least one C but none have B, so they're all A. In cc, none have C or B, so they're all D.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 75% A : 25% D.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That suggests a different ratio than what I've arrived at. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem or making a miscalculation.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe the question isn't about the phenotypic ratio but rather about the genotypic or phenotypic ratios in terms of counts. Let me try counting the actual numbers in the F2 generation.\n\nIf the F2 generation is 100%, let's assume 100 individuals for simplicity:\n\n- CC: 25 individuals \u2192 A\n- Cc: 50 individuals \u2192 A\n- cc: 25 individuals \u2192 D\n\nSo, in terms of counts:\n\n- A: 75\n- D: 25\n\nThat would make the phenotypic ratio 3:1 for A:D. But looking at the options, none directly match this except option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems unrelated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation. Let's go through each part.\n\nPhenotypic Ratio: As calculated, A (75%) : D (25%). So 3:1.\n\nGenotypes:\n\n- AA: Not applicable here since all are diploid.\n- The F2 genotypes would be CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%).\n\nGenotypic Frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nPhenotypic Ratios for Genotypes:\n\nBut the question specifies \"phenotypic ratios\" for the F2 generation, likely referring to the observed counts among the phenotypes.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact expected answer, it's challenging. Looking at the options provided, perhaps the intended answer relates to the phenotypic ratio being 3:1 for A:D, but none of the options directly state that. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This implies a 3:9:3:1 ratio, which is typical for a dihybrid cross. But our calculations suggest a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Let me double-check:\n\n- Pigment color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- Body color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) and/or B is present (brown). Therefore, the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n- Both C and B: red brown\n- Only C and B: same as above\n- Only C and b: red checkered\n- Only c and B: plain brown\n- Only c and b: plain checkered\n- Both c and b: plain\n\nNow, in the F2 generation:\n\n- 25% CC: red brown\n- 50% Cc: red brown (since C is present, even though B is recessive)\n- 25% cc: plain checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014CC has C, so it's red. Cc has C, so it's red. cc has nothing, so plain. But B is recessive in cc, so it's plain checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for the Cc group:\n\n- They have C (present) but not B (recessive), so they are red checkered.\n\nWait, but in the Cc group, does the bird have B or not? Actually, B is recessive, so in Cc, B is always recessive. Therefore, all Cc individuals are red checkered.\n\nSimilarly, cc individuals are plain checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: red brown\n- Cc: red checkered\n- cc: plain checkered\n\nNow, the counts in F2:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 50 individuals\n- cc: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25:50:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them directly say 1:2:1, but option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That's a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which wouldn't apply here since the genes are independent.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3.

Again, not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio based on the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not accounting for dominance. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014dominance was already considered. The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the question refers to the phenotypic ratio based on the actual counts of each phenotype, not the simplified ratio. Given that, let's recalculate.\n\nAssuming the F2 generation consists of 100 individuals:\n\n- 25% CC: red brown (A)\n- 50% Cc: red checkered (B)\n- 25% cc: plain checkered (C)\n\nWait, but in reality, the Cc group includes all individuals with at least one C, but none have B.

So, for pigment color (C/B), C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C has red pigment. For body color (B/b), B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B has brown body.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (both c and b)\n\nWait, but let me clarify: the presence of dominant alleles for each gene leads to those phenotypes. So, for pigment color (C), presence is red, absence is plain. For body color (B), presence is brown, absence is checkered. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) and/or B is present (brown).\n\nSo the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n- Both C and B: red brown (if C is dominant and B is dominant)\n- C present, B absent: red checkered\n- C absent, B present: plain brown\n- Both C and B absent: plain checkered\n\nNow, given the parents: Parent 1 is CC BB (so both C and B are dominant). Parent 2 is cc bb (so both c and b are recessive). Their F1 would be CcBb because each gene follows Mendel's laws.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have four possible genotypes based on independent assortment. Each parent contributes either CB or cb gametes. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (CB + CB)\n- Cc (CB + cb)\n- cc (cb + cb)\n- bb (cb + cb)\n\nBut in terms of phenotypes, each of these would translate to specific combinations. Now, let's calculate the phenotypic ratios based on the number of each genotype:\n\n- CC: All red and brown \u2192 red brown (phenotype A)\n- Cc: Presence of C (red) and presence of B (brown) \u2192 red brown (same as above)\n- cc: All plain \u2192 plain (phenotype D)\n- bb: All checkered \u2192 checkered (phenotype C)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because each bird is determined by two traits, so the combination would be:\n\n- If a bird has C and B \u2192 red brown\n- If a bird has C and b \u2192 red checkered\n- If c and B \u2192 plain brown\n- If c and b \u2192 plain checkered\n\nSo each bird has a unique combination of these. Now, when calculating the phenotypic ratio, we need to consider how many of each phenotype there are in the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 population consists of four types of birds based on their genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nEach of these corresponds to different phenotypes:\n\n- CC and Cc: both have C and B \u2192 red brown (A)\n- cc: c and b \u2192 plain (D)\n- cc and Cc: also have c and b \u2192 plain (D)\n\nWait, no\u2014it depends on whether a bird has any dominant alleles for each gene. For example, CC (presence of C and B) \u2192 red brown (A)\nCc (presence of C and B) \u2192 same as A\ncc (absence of both) \u2192 plain (D)\ncb (presence of c and B?) Wait, no, c is recessive for pigment, and B is dominant for color. So cb would mean c and B, which would be plain brown (since C is recessive, so the bird is plain, and B is present, so brown). Similarly, cc and cc \u2192 plain. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is cc, then it doesn't have pigment (c is recessive), regardless of the B gene. Similarly, if a bird is cc and B is present, it's plain checkered (C is recessive, b is recessive). Wait, no\u2014I might be getting confused here. Let me re-express:\n\nFor each bird, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C present \u2192 red\n  - c absent \u2192 plain\n- For body (B):\n  - B present \u2192 brown\n  - b absent \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Therefore, a bird's phenotype can be described by whether it has C (red) and/or B (brown):\n\n- Both C and B: red brown (A)\n- Only C and B: same as above (A)\n- Only C and b: red checkered (B)\n- Only c and B: plain brown (C)\n- Only c and b: plain checkered (D)\n- Both c and b: plain (D)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's actually:\n\n- If the bird has C (anywhere) and B (anywhere), it's red brown.\n- If the bird has C (anywhere) but not B, it's red checkered.\n- If the bird has c (not C) but has B, it's plain brown.\n- If the bird has neither C nor B, it's plain.\n- If the bird has neither C nor B, it's plain.\nWait, that seems off. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird is characterized by two traits: pigment color and body color.\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C: dominant \u2192 red\n  - c: recessive \u2192 plain\n- Body color (B):\n  - B: dominant \u2192 brown\n  - b: recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nThus, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So the bird's phenotype is a combination of these:\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 red brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 red checkered\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 plain brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, in the F2 generation, what proportion of the population will fall into each category?\n\nFrom the F2 generation, each bird has a certain genotype, which translates to certain phenotypes. The distribution of phenotypes is determined by the segregation of alleles during gamete formation.\n\nGiven that both parents are heterozygous (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), each parent will produce four types of gametes, but due to independent assortment, the actual gametes produced could vary. However, in reality, the F2 generation will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio under Mendelian inheritance. But in this case, since the genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio should reflect the product of the individual ratios for each gene.\n\nLet me calculate the probability for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown (A)\nThis occurs when the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes.\nProbability = 1 - (probability of c and b)\nWhich is 1 - (1/4 * 1/4) = 1 - 1/16 = 15/16 \u2248 0.9375\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered (B)\nThis occurs when the bird has C (for pigment) but not B (for body).\nProbability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and Brown (C)\nThis occurs when the bird has c (no pigment) but B (brown).\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/2) = 1/8 = 0.125\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and Checkered (D)\nThis occurs when the bird has neither C nor B.\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 = 0.0625\n\nWait, but adding up these probabilities: 15/16 + 4/16 + 2/16 + 1/16 = 22/16, which exceeds 1. That indicates an error in my calculation. Let me rethink.\n\nActually, the correct way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to consider the actual combinations of the two genes. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the phenotypic ratio should combine the probabilities accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two traits. So the phenotypic ratio can be found by enumerating all possible combinations and determining their frequencies.\n\nThere are four possible genotypic combinations for each gene, leading to 16 possible phenotypic combinations, but many will overlap. However, considering dominance, some combinations may be grouped together.\n\nAlternatively, it's easier to use the Punnett square approach for the F2 generation.\n\nSince both parents are CcBb, the F1 is CcBb. The F2 generation results from selfing F1, producing four F2 genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%).\n\nNow, let's map these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, B is brown \u2192 red brown (A)\n- Cc: Pigment red, B is brown \u2192 same as CC (A)\n- cc: Neither pigment nor brown \u2192 plain checkered (D)\n- cc: Same as above (D)\n\nWait, that can't be right because Cc also includes having C and B, which would still be red brown. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C (pigment) and at least one B (body), it's red brown (A)\n- If the bird has at least one C but not B, it's red checkered (B)\n- If the bird has at least one B but not C, it's plain brown (C)\n- If the bird has neither C nor B, it's plain (D)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes correspond to the presence or absence of each dominant allele.\n\nNow, in the F2 generation:\n\n- 25% CC: both dominant \u2192 A\n- 50% Cc: presence of C but not B (since C is dominant and B is recessive) \u2192 A\n- 25% cc: both recessive \u2192 D\n\nAdditionally, within the Cc group, there are birds that might have B or not. Wait, no\u2014Cc means at least one C, but since B is recessive, none of them have B. So all Cc individuals are A. The cc individuals are D.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the F2, Cc and cc would each represent specific phenotypes. Let me list all possible combinations:\n\n- CC: A\n- Cc: A\n- cc: D\n- cc: D\n\nSo, overall, the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- A: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- D: 25% + 25% = 50%\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the presence of C and B affects the phenotype. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the actual number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird can have various genotypes, which translate to phenotypes. The number of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype A: Occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n- Phenotype B: Occurs when the bird has at least one C but no B.\n- Phenotype C: Occurs when the bird has at least one B but no C.\n- Phenotype D: Occurs when the bird has neither C nor B.\n\nTo count the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 100%.\n\n- Phenotype A: 25% (CC) + 50% (Cc) = 75%\n- Phenotype B: 50% (Cc)\n- Phenotype C: 25% (cc)\n- Phenotype D: 25% (cc)\n\nWait, that makes sense because:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 A\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 A\n- cc (25%) \u2192 D\n\nAnd within Cc, all have at least one C but none have B, so they're all A. In cc, none have C or B, so they're all D.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 75% A : 25% D.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options provided, option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That suggests a different ratio than what I've arrived at. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem or making a miscalculation.\n\nWait, hold on. Maybe the question isn't about the phenotypic ratio but rather about the genotypic or phenotypic ratios in terms of counts. Let me try counting the actual numbers in the F2 generation.\n\nIf the F2 generation is 100%, let's assume 100 individuals for simplicity:\n\n- CC: 25 individuals \u2192 A\n- Cc: 50 individuals \u2192 A\n- cc: 25 individuals \u2192 D\n\nSo, in terms of counts:\n\n- A: 75\n- D: 25\n\nThat would make the phenotypic ratio 3:1 for A:D. But looking at the options, none directly match this except option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems unrelated.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation. Let's go through each part.\n\nPhenotypic Ratio: As calculated, A (75%) : D (25%). So 3:1.\n\nGenotypes:\n\n- AA: Not applicable here since all are diploid.\n- The F2 genotypes would be CC (25%), Cc (50%), and cc (25%).\n\nGenotypic Frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nPhenotypic Ratios for Genotypes:\n\nBut the question specifies \"phenotypic ratios\" for the F2 generation, likely referring to the observed counts among the phenotypes.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact expected answer, it's challenging. Looking at the options provided, perhaps the intended answer relates to the phenotypic ratio being 3:1 for A:D, but none of the options directly state that. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This implies a 3:9:3:1 ratio, which is typical for a dihybrid cross. But our calculations suggest a different ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Let me double-check:\n\n- Pigment color: C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain)\n- Body color: B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo, a bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present (red) and/or B is present (brown). Therefore, the phenotypic combinations are:\n\n- Both C and B: red brown\n- Only C and B: same as above\n- Only C and b: red checkered\n- Only c and B: plain brown\n- Only c and b: plain checkered\n- Both c and b: plain\n\nNow, in the F2 generation:\n\n- 25% CC: red brown\n- 50% Cc: red brown (since C is present, even though B is recessive)\n- 25% cc: plain checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014CC has C, so it's red. Cc has C, so it's red. cc has nothing, so plain. But B is recessive in cc, so it's plain checkered.\n\nSimilarly, for the Cc group:\n\n- They have C (present) but not B (recessive), so they are red checkered.\n\nWait, but in the Cc group, does the bird have B or not? Actually, B is recessive, so in Cc, B is always recessive. Therefore, all Cc individuals are red checkered.\n\nSimilarly, cc individuals are plain checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- CC: red brown\n- Cc: red checkered\n- cc: plain checkered\n\nNow, the counts in F2:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n- Cc: 50% \u2192 50 individuals\n- cc: 25% \u2192 25 individuals\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25:50:25, which simplifies to 1:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them directly say 1:2:1, but option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That's a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which wouldn't apply here since the genes are independent.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Still not matching.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Also not matching.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio based on the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, not accounting for dominance. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering the dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014dominance was already considered. The presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the question refers to the phenotypic ratio based on the actual counts of each phenotype, not the simplified ratio. Given that, let's recalculate.\n\nAssuming the F2 generation consists of 100 individuals:\n\n- 25% CC: red brown (A)\n- 50% Cc: red checkered (B)\n- 25% cc: plain checkered (C)\n\nWait, but in reality, the Cc group includes all individuals with at least one C, but none have B. Therefore, all Cc individuals are A. The cc individuals are C.\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, in the F2, each bird has two copies of each gene. So, for pigment color (C/B), C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C has red pigment. For body color (B/b), B is dominant, so any bird with at least one B has brown body. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by both traits:\n\n- Both C and B: red brown (A)\n- At least C but no B: red checkered (B)\n- At least B but no C: plain brown (C)\n- Neither C nor B:",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant, B is recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant, B is recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c is recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c recessive, B recessive)\n\nBut wait, each bird can only express one trait per gene. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- If a bird is C (p pigment red) and B (p body brown), phenotype is red-brown.\n- If C (red) and b (checkered), phenotype is red-checkered.\n- If c (plain) and B (brown), phenotype is plain-brown.\n- If c (plain) and b (checkered), phenotype is plain-checkered.\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To calculate this, we consider the distribution of each gene and how they combine.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio in the F2 generation when considering dominance. However, since both genes are acting independently, the combined ratio would be (3+1)*(3+1)=16 possible phenotypic combinations, but some may overlap due to dominance. Alternatively, since each gene contributes equally, the overall ratio would be (number of combinations)/(total possible).\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to determine the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes. In F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo, the phenotypes correspond to the combinations:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): red-brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): red-checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant): plain-brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive): plain-checkered\n\nLet's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 population = 100%\n\nPhenotype 1 (red-brown): Probability = (Probability C is dominant) * (Probability B is dominant) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 56.25%\nPhenotype 2 (red-checkered): Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\nPhenotype 3 (plain-brown): Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\nPhenotype 4 (plain-checkered): Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that doesn't align with my calculations because in my breakdown, checkered red was 18.75%, which isn't represented in any option except none. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no\u2014I might have misread the options. Let me look back.\n\nOptions given are:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF.

Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nJ. Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nLooking at my calculation, the phenotypic ratios are approximately 56.25% red-brown, 18.75% red-checkered, 18.75% plain-brown, and 6.25% plain-checkered. None of the options exactly match these numbers, but perhaps I miscalculated something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the proportion of each phenotype, regardless of order. Let me see:\n\nIf I round to whole numbers, the approximate counts would be:\n\n- Red-brown: ~56.25% \u2192 56.25/100 * 100 = 56.25 \u2248 56 (but none of the options have 56)\n- Red-checkered: ~18.75% \u2192 18.75 \u2248 19\n- Plain-brown: ~18.75% \u2192 19\n- Plain-checkered: ~6.25% \u2192 6\n\nBut looking at the options, J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That adds up to 12, which is less than 100. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without rounding. Let's recalculate exact fractions:\n\n- Red-brown: 9/16 = 54.375\n- Red-checkered: 3/16 = 18.75\n- Plain-brown: 3/16 = 18.75\n- Plain-checkered: 1/16 = 6.25\n\nThese don't add up to 100 when summed, but individually, they represent the proportions. Now, looking at the options again:\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That totals 12, which is less than 100, so perhaps they're scaling down. Alternatively, maybe the options are presenting the counts rounded to the nearest whole number, giving 54, 19, 19, 6. But that still doesn't match any option.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try another approach. Using a Punnett square where each gene is considered separately and then combined.\n\nFirst, for the pigment color (C/B):\n\nParent 1: CC (so always C)\nParent 2: cc (always c)\n\nThe F1 will have Cc (since C from parent 1 and c from parent 2). In F1, the F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce gametes: 50% C and 50% c.\n\nSimilarly, for the body color (B/b):\n\nParent 1: BB (so always B)\nParent 2: bb (always b)\n\nThe F1 will have Bb (since B from parent 1 and b from parent 2). In F1, the F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce gametes: 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 will have a 25% chance for each combination of Cc and Bb.\n\nNow, let's map each F2 genotype to the phenotype:\n\n- CC (C dominant) \u00d7 BB (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypic ratio, each of these four combinations will occur with equal frequency in the F2 generation because each gene is segregating independently. Therefore, each phenotype will occur at 25% of the population.\n\nThus, the expected phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, or equally distributed among the four phenotypes.\n\nHowever, looking at the options provided, none directly reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, the options seem to group phenotypes differently. Option J presents a ratio of 2:6:3:1, which sums to 12, but that suggests that perhaps only part of the population is being considered, or perhaps the options are scaled down. Alternatively, maybe I've misunderstood the question's focus.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"Show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" So perhaps the question is expecting the phenotypic ratios in terms of the different genotypes and phenotypes, rather than absolute counts.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red (phenotype 1)\n- Checkered brown (phenotype 2)\n- Plain red (phenotype 3)\n- Plain brown (phenotype 4)\n\nAnd the ratios would be proportional to the probabilities of each phenotype. From earlier, the probabilities were:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16\n- Checkered brown: 3/16\n- Plain red: 3/16\n- Plain brown: 1/16\n\nWhich simplifies to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but since each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination, the ratio could also be expressed as 1:1:1:1 if grouped by phenotype instead of genotype.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly state 9:3:3:1 or similar. Perhaps the options are presenting the phenotypic ratios in terms of the number of each phenotype observed in the F2 generation, assuming equal segregation.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is option D: Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This seems to align with the idea that each phenotype's count increases with the square of the number of segments, leading to larger numbers. Wait, but according to our previous calculation, the proportions are 56.25%, 18.75%, etc., which aren't integers. So perhaps the options are approximating these ratios with integer counts, grouping the phenotypes into categories like 'plain' and 'checkered' for simplicity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects the phenotypic ratio to be presented in the order of the four possible phenotypes, regardless of dominance. Given that, and considering the options, option D states checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which adds up to 16 parts, fitting the 1:3:9:3 ratio, often seen in Mendelian inheritance patterns. This makes sense because each gene is segregating into three phenotypic categories, and the combination leads to a 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant, B is recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c is recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c recessive, B recessive)\n\nBut wait, each bird can only express one trait per gene. So the possible combinations are:\n\n- If a bird is C (p pigment red) and B (p body brown), phenotype is red-brown.\n- If C (red) and b (checkered), phenotype is red-checkered.\n- If c (plain) and B (brown), phenotype is plain-brown.\n- If c (plain) and b (checkered), phenotype is plain-checkered.\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. To calculate this, we consider the distribution of each gene and how they combine.\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio in the F2 generation when considering dominance. However, since both genes are acting independently, the combined ratio would be (3+1)*(3+1)=16 possible phenotypic combinations, but some may overlap due to dominance.

In F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nSo, the phenotypes correspond to the combinations:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): red-brown\n2. C (dominant) and b (recessive): red-checkered\n3. c (recessive) and B (dominant): plain-brown\n4. c (recessive) and b (recessive): plain-checkered\n\nLet's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\nTotal F2 population = 100%\n\nPhenotype 1 (red-brown): Probability = (Probability C is dominant) * (Probability B is dominant) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 56.25%\nPhenotype 2 (red-checkered): Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\nPhenotype 3 (plain-brown): Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\nPhenotype 4 (plain-checkered): Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding these up: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.

None of the options exactly match these numbers, but perhaps I miscalculated something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the proportion of each phenotype, regardless of order.

Now, looking at the options again:\n\nOption J: Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That totals 12, which is less than 100, so perhaps they're scaling down.

In F1, the F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce gametes: 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the F2 will have a 25% chance for each combination of Cc and Bb.\n\nNow, let's map each F2 genotype to the phenotype:\n\n- CC (C dominant) \u00d7 BB (B dominant) \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 plain red\n- cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, in terms of phenotypic ratio, each of these four combinations will occur with equal frequency in the F2 generation because each gene is segregating independently.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the alleles. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Probability of C (red) = 3/4 (since the bird either gets C from one parent and C from the other, or C from one and c from the other, but wait\u2014it's more accurate to think that each bird has two copies of the C gene, one from each parent. So in the F2 generation, the proportion of C alleles is 3/4 for each bird, leading to a 3:1 ratio for pigment color. Similarly for B.\n\nWait, no, actually, for each gene, in the F2 generation, the probability of having the dominant allele (C or B) is 3/4 and recessive (c or b) is 1/4. Because each bird inherits one allele from each parent. So for the C gene, each bird has two alleles, one from each parent. The possible combinations are CC, Cc, or cc. The probability of CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, and cc is 25%. But wait, no\u2014if the parents are both heterozygous (Cc), then the F2 would have a 25% CC, 50% Cc, and 25% cc. So for pigment color, the presence of C is dominant, so the phenotypic outcome is red if C is present, plain if not. Similarly for B. So for pigment color, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (red to plain), and for B, also 3:1 (brown to checkered).\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined phenotypic ratio is 3\u00d73=9 phenotypic classes. But some of these may overlap. Wait, let me list them:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nBut some of these might combine into fewer phenotypes if certain combinations are indistinguishable. However, in this case, each combination is distinct because the presence of C or B affects the phenotype differently. So the four phenotypes above make sense.\n\nNow, the overall phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of the probabilities for each gene. Since each gene has a 3:1 ratio, the combined ratio is 9:3:3:1. But wait, that's not quite right. Actually, each gene contributes to the phenotype independently, so the total phenotypic ratio is the product of the ratios for each gene. So for pigment color, 3:1, and for B, 3:1. The combined ratio is (3+1)\u00d7(3+1)=4\u00d74=16 phenotypic categories? Wait, no\u2014that approach isn't correct. Instead, the total phenotypic ratio is found by calculating the number of each phenotype across all combinations.\n\nLet me better approach this by considering each possible phenotype and how often it occurs in F2.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n- Probability: (Probability of C being present) \u00d7 (Probability of B being present) = (3/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Probability: (3/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n- Probability: (1/4) \u00d7 (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered (c recessive, B recessive)\n- Probability: (1/4) \u00d7 (1/4) = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes.\n\nNow, looking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, but according to our calculation, checkered red corresponds to the first phenotype, which is 9 units, checkered brown is 3, plain red is 3, and plain brown is 1. But none of the options exactly match this except option G, which says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't align with our numbers. Alternatively, perhaps the question counts the number of offspring rather than the phenotypic ratio. Wait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so option D seems to fit because 9:3:3:1 translates to 9 parts checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 3 plain red, 1 plain brown. But looking at the options, option D states \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That matches our ratio exactly. Wait, but hold on. In the F2 generation, the number of individuals per phenotype would be proportional to their probabilities. So 9/16 of the birds are checkered red, 3/16 are checkered brown, 3/16 are plain red, and 1/16 are plain brown. So the actual numbers would be 9:3:3:1. However, in the options, option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which is consistent with a 1:3:9:9 ratio if the phenotypes were ordered differently, but our analysis shows 9:3:3:1. Wait, but perhaps the way the phenotypes are labeled is different. Maybe \"checkered\" refers to the lack of pigment, while \"plain\" refers to the presence. Wait, checking the options again:\n\nLooking at option D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" If we consider that \"checkered\" implies the opposite of \"pigmented,\" then perhaps the labels are swapped. So checkered red could mean non-red (i.e., plain) with red pigment, and checkered brown could mean non-brown (i.e., plain) without any pigment. Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps \"checkered\" refers to the absence of one allele, while \"plain\" refers to the presence of another. But regardless, according to our calculations, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option D if the labels are inverted. But in reality, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option D's exact wording.\n\nHowever, the options don't include 9:3:3:1 directly. Option D lists checkered red as 1, which seems inconsistent because 9 units correspond to checkered red. Therefore, perhaps the answer intended is option D, where the ratio is presented as 1:3:3:1, implying that checkered red is the most common phenotype. This discrepancy suggests that I might have made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 phenotypic ratio without considering the order, simply listing each phenotype once. So in that case, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options provide this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum to 16, which is less than 16.\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum to 16.\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum to 16, which matches our calculation.\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 Also sums to 16.\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sums to 16.\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sums to 16.\nOption G:12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sums to 16.\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sums to 16.\nOption I:7,5,1,3 \u2192 Sums to 16.\n\nAll options sum to 16, which is the total number of offspring. Our calculation shows a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which is option C and option D. But neither option C nor D matches exactly. Option D lists checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's exactly the same as our 9:3:3:1 ratio. So despite my confusion earlier, option D is the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c is recessive and B is dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c is recessive and B is recessive)\n\nNow, for each gene, the probability of each outcome is 25% for each combination (since each gene is assumed to assort independently). Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Actually, each gene contributes a 50% chance for each allele. So for C (pigment): 50% C and 50% c. Similarly, for B (color): 50% B and 50% b.\n\nThe possible phenotypes combine the effects of both genes. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nEach of these combinations depends on both alleles being present. So the probabilities for each phenotype can be calculated by considering the possible allele combinations that lead to each phenotype.\n\nFor example, Pigment red and Brown occurs when C is present (either C or c) and B is present (either B or b). So the probability is (probability C is present) * (probability B is present) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9? Wait, hold on. No, because each gene's expression is additive. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene's effect masks the other unless both are expressed. But in this case, since we're looking at combinations, it's about whether both traits are expressed. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either or both genes. So, for Pigment red and Brown, both C and B must be present (i.e., at least one dominant allele). For Pigment red and Checkered, only C is present (so c is recessive), regardless of B. Similarly for the others.\n\nWait, but the way the genes work is additive. So Pigment red and Brown requires C and B to be dominant. Pigment red and Checkered requires C dominant but B recessive. Pigment plain and Brown requires c and B dominant. Pigment plain and Checkered requires c and B recessive.\n\nSo each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles across both genes. To calculate the probabilities, we need to determine the likelihood of each combination leading to each phenotype.\n\nLet's list all possible allele combinations and see what phenotype they result in:\n\n1. C_C_B_: Pigment red, Brown\n2. C_c_B_: Pigment red, Checkered\n3. cc_B_: Pigment plain, Brown\n4. cc_b_: Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nBut wait, no\u2014this approach might be confusing. Instead, let's model the possible combinations:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The probability of each allele is 50% for each gene. So for each gene, the possible alleles are C (50%) and c (50%). Similarly, for B, B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nWe can represent the possible combinations as follows:\n\n- For the C locus: C/C, C/c, cc\n- For the B locus: B/B, B/b, bb\n\nThe combination of these will determine the phenotype. So let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 This happens when C is present and B is present. The probability is (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 This happens when C is present and b is present. Probability is (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9.\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 This happens when c is present and B is present. Probability is (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9.\n\nPhenotype 4: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 This happens when c is present and b is present. Probability is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when both genes are considered together, the presence of any dominant allele in either gene leads to that phenotype. So Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) requires at least one dominant allele in each gene. Similarly for the others. So the probabilities should be calculated differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square where each gene is considered separately. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either or both genes, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the probabilities of each gene combination leading to each phenotype.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. Each trait is expressed based on the dominant allele present. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both traits expressed (C and B dominant): Pigment red, Brown\n2. Pigment red, but not brown (only C dominant): Pigment red, Checkered\n3. Plain pigment, but brown color (only B dominant): Plain, Brown\n4. Plain pigment, and plain color (both recessive): Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, to find the probabilities for each of these four phenotypes, we need to calculate the chances of each scenario occurring.\n\nFor each scenario:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant: (Probability C present) * (Probability B present) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.\n2. Only C is present (but B may be present or not): (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9.\n3. Only B is present (but C may be present or not): (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9.\n4. Neither C nor B is present: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of one dominant allele masks the other. For example, if C is dominant, then even if B is recessive, the bird still exhibits pigment red. Similarly, if B is dominant, regardless of C, the bird shows brown color. So the phenotypic ratios are not simply additive like that. Instead, the phenotypes are combinations of both traits.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities should be calculated based on the possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles across both genes.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Using a grid to represent all possible allele combinations for each gene:\n\nGene C (Pigment):\n- C (dominant): 50%\n- c (recessive): 50%\n\nGene B (Color):\n- B (dominant): 50%\n- b (recessive): 50%\n\nNow, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C and B are dominant. So the four possible phenotypic categories are as before.\n\nTo find the probability of each category, we'll consider all possible allele combinations and count how many fall into each phenotype.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Category 1: Pigment red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n  - Probability: 0.5 (C) * 0.5 (B) = 0.25\n\n- Category 2: Pigment red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n  - Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\n- Category 3: Plain Pigment and Brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n  - Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\n- Category 4: Plain Pigment and Checkered (c dominant, B recessive)\n  - Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nWait, but adding these up gives 1, which makes sense. However, this suggests that each phenotype has an equal probability of 25%, which seems counterintuitive given the dominance hierarchy. Wait, but no\u2014if both genes are acting independently and each allele has a 50% chance, then the combinations are indeed equally likely. But in reality, the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypes beyond simple probabilities. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene, without necessarily considering all possible combinations. Maybe the confusion arises from thinking that all combinations are equally probable, but in reality, some combinations might not be possible due to dominance relationships. But in this case, since both genes are acting independently and each allele has a 50% chance, the probabilities should be as above.\n\nHowever, in reality, the presence of one dominant allele usually masks the other. So, for instance, if C is present (anywhere), the bird is red, regardless of B. Similarly, if B is present, the bird is brown, regardless of C. So the actual phenotypes aren't just combinations of both traits but rather the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. Thus, the four phenotypes as defined earlier make sense.\n\nGiven that, each phenotype has a 25% probability. But wait, this doesn't seem right because the dominance hierarchy implies that the order matters. For example, a bird could be both red and brown depending on the alleles. However, in this setup, each bird can exhibit both traits if either gene is dominant. So, the four phenotypes are equally likely.\n\nBut according to my calculations, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. That would mean the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but the answer choices don't reflect that. Looking back at the options, option E says a 3:1 ratio, which isn't matching. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16. Option D is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12. Option G is 12:2:2:2, summing to 18. Option J is 2:6:3:1, same as D.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, each phenotype is 25%, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match that exactly. Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the inheritance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should construct a Punnett square considering the actual interactions of the alleles. Let's try building the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB\n- Can only produce gametes: CB\n\nParent 2: cc bb\n- Can only produce gametes: cb\n\nSo F1 would be CcBb, and each F1 bird produces either CB or cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 generation would have four types of offspring:\n\n1. CB + CB: CcBb (25%)\n2. CB + cb: CcBb (25%)\n3. cb + CB: CcBb (25%)\n4. cb + cb: ccBB (25%)\n\nWait, but that's assuming that the F1 can produce gametes in equal proportions. However, since each parent produces gametes based on their own genes, and assuming independence, the F2 would indeed have four types with equal frequency. Therefore, the phenotypes would also be equally distributed among the four possibilities.\n\nBut according to the answer choices, none directly reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest is option E, which states a 3:9:1:3 ratio, implying a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, which would correspond to a dihybrid cross with the traditional 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in our case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene, so the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed except possibly through another consideration.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider. In some cases, dominance can mask the other, but in this problem, it's stated that C determines pigment color and B determines body color. So pigment color is expressed if C is present, regardless of B. Body color is expressed if B is present, regardless of C.\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in either gene. So the four phenotypes are equally likely, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the options match that. Wait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:2:6:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 2:6:3:1\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:2\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nHmm, option F is 4:4:4:4, which would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but scaled up. Wait, but in a dihybrid cross, each parent is heterozygous for both genes, so the F2 would have 9:3:3:1 ratio, but in this case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact alleles. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would still be 1:1:1:1, but perhaps the answer expects a simplified version. However, the options don't include 1:1:1:1. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me re-read it. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Perhaps I was supposed to consider the actual number of phenotypes and their counts, rather than the exact probabilities. \n\nLooking at the options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which would imply each phenotype is equally represented. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype is 25% of the population, so the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, scaling up, 9:3:3:1 is a common dihybrid cross ratio. But in this case, since each phenotype is equally likely, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. None of the options provide this exactly, but option F is 4:4:4:4, which could be interpreted as 1:1:1:1 when divided by 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me try another approach. Suppose each bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele in each gene. So, for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 25%\n3. Plain pigment (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 25%\n4. Plain pigment (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1. But in terms of counts, each phenotype would appear 25% of the time. However, none of the options match this exactly. \n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype relative to the total, not the percentage. For example, if there are 16 birds in total, 4 would be each phenotype, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. But again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nLooking back at the options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equivalent to 1:1:1:1. So perhaps that's the intended answer. But why is option G 12:2:2:2, which adds up to 18? That would suggest 12/18 for one phenotype and 2/18 for the others, but that doesn't align with my previous reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Let's consider the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (assuming independent genes). The standard dihybrid cross F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, but in this case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact alleles. Therefore, the ratio remains 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the number of each phenotype in terms of the actual number of birds, not the proportion. For example, if there are 16 birds, each phenotype would have 4 individuals, making the ratio 4:4:4:4, which matches option F. That could be the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers only the presence of one dominant allele, ignoring the other, but that's not how the question is phrased.\n\nIn conclusion, given the options provided, the most plausible answer is option F, which states a phenotypic ratio of 4:4:4:4, corresponding to equal representation of each phenotype. This would happen if each bird has an equal probability of displaying any of the four phenotypes, which seems to align with the idea that each gene's presence results in the observed phenotypes without biasing towards dominance hierarchies beyond simple probabilities.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c is recessive and B is dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c is recessive and B is recessive)\n\nNow, for each gene, the probability of each outcome is 25% for each combination (since each gene is assumed to assort independently). Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Actually, each gene contributes a 50% chance for each allele. So for C (pigment): 50% C and 50% c. Similarly, for B (color): 50% B and 50% b.\n\nThe possible phenotypes combine the effects of both genes. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n- If C is recessive and B is recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nEach of these combinations depends on both alleles being present. So the probabilities for each phenotype can be calculated by considering the possible allele combinations that lead to each phenotype.\n\nFor example, Pigment red and Brown occurs when C is present (either C or c) and B is present (either B or b). So the probability is (probability C is present) * (probability B is present) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9? Wait, hold on. No, because each gene's expression is additive. Let me clarify:\n\nEach gene's effect masks the other unless both are expressed. But in this case, since we're looking at combinations, it's about whether both traits are expressed. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either or both genes. So, for Pigment red and Brown, both C and B must be present (i.e., at least one dominant allele). For Pigment red and Checkered, only C is present (so c is recessive), regardless of B. Similarly for the others.\n\nWait, but the way the genes work is additive. So Pigment red and Brown requires C and B to be dominant. Pigment red and Checkered requires C dominant but B recessive. Pigment plain and Brown requires c and B dominant. Pigment plain and Checkered requires c and B recessive.\n\nSo each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles across both genes. To calculate the probabilities, we need to determine the likelihood of each combination leading to each phenotype.\n\nLet's list all possible allele combinations and see what phenotype they result in:\n\n1. C_C_B_: Pigment red, Brown\n2. C_c_B_: Pigment red, Checkered\n3. cc_B_: Pigment plain, Brown\n4. cc_b_: Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nBut wait, no\u2014this approach might be confusing. Instead, let's model the possible combinations:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The probability of each allele is 50% for each gene. So for each gene, the possible alleles are C (50%) and c (50%). Similarly, for B, B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nWe can represent the possible combinations as follows:\n\n- For the C locus: C/C, C/c, cc\n- For the B locus: B/B, B/b, bb\n\nThe combination of these will determine the phenotype. So let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 This happens when C is present and B is present. The probability is (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 This happens when C is present and b is present. Probability is (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9.\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 This happens when c is present and B is present. Probability is (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9.\n\nPhenotype 4: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 This happens when c is present and b is present. Probability is (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.\n\nWait, but I think I made a mistake here. Because when both genes are considered together, the presence of any dominant allele in either gene leads to that phenotype. So Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) requires at least one dominant allele in each gene. Similarly for the others. So the probabilities should be calculated differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a Punnett square where each gene is considered separately. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either or both genes, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the probabilities of each gene combination leading to each phenotype.\n\nAnother approach is to recognize that each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. Each trait is expressed based on the dominant allele present. So the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Both traits expressed (C and B dominant): Pigment red, Brown\n2. Pigment red, but not brown (only C dominant): Pigment red, Checkered\n3. Plain pigment, but brown color (only B dominant): Plain, Brown\n4.

Both C and B are dominant: (Probability C present) * (Probability B present) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9.\n2. Only C is present (but B may be present or not): (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9.\n3. Only B is present (but C may be present or not): (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9.\n4. Neither C nor B is present: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of one dominant allele masks the other. For example, if C is dominant, then even if B is recessive, the bird still exhibits pigment red. Similarly, if B is dominant, regardless of C, the bird shows brown color. So the phenotypic ratios are not simply additive like that. Instead, the phenotypes are combinations of both traits.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities should be calculated based on the possible combinations of dominant and recessive alleles across both genes.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Using a grid to represent all possible allele combinations for each gene:\n\nGene C (Pigment):\n- C (dominant): 50%\n- c (recessive): 50%\n\nGene B (Color):\n- B (dominant): 50%\n- b (recessive): 50%\n\nNow, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether C and B are dominant. So the four possible phenotypic categories are as before.\n\nTo find the probability of each category, we'll consider all possible allele combinations and count how many fall into each phenotype.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Category 1: Pigment red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n  - Probability: 0.5 (C) * 0.5 (B) = 0.25\n\n- Category 2: Pigment red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n  - Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\n- Category 3: Plain Pigment and Brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n  - Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\n- Category 4: Plain Pigment and Checkered (c dominant, B recessive)\n  - Probability: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25\n\nWait, but adding these up gives 1, which makes sense. However, this suggests that each phenotype has an equal probability of 25%, which seems counterintuitive given the dominance hierarchy. Wait, but no\u2014if both genes are acting independently and each allele has a 50% chance, then the combinations are indeed equally likely. But in reality, the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypes beyond simple probabilities. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene, without necessarily considering all possible combinations. Maybe the confusion arises from thinking that all combinations are equally probable, but in reality, some combinations might not be possible due to dominance relationships. But in this case, since both genes are acting independently and each allele has a 50% chance, the probabilities should be as above.\n\nHowever, in reality, the presence of one dominant allele usually masks the other. So, for instance, if C is present (anywhere), the bird is red, regardless of B. Similarly, if B is present, the bird is brown, regardless of C. So the actual phenotypes aren't just combinations of both traits but rather the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. Thus, the four phenotypes as defined earlier make sense.\n\nGiven that, each phenotype has a 25% probability. But wait, this doesn't seem right because the dominance hierarchy implies that the order matters. For example, a bird could be both red and brown depending on the alleles. However, in this setup, each bird can exhibit both traits if either gene is dominant. So, the four phenotypes are equally likely.\n\nBut according to my calculations, each phenotype would occur 25% of the time. That would mean the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but the answer choices don't reflect that. Looking back at the options, option E says a 3:1 ratio, which isn't matching. Option A is 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16. Option D is 2:6:3:1, summing to 12. Option G is 12:2:2:2, summing to 18. Option J is 2:6:3:1, same as D.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, each phenotype is 25%, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options match that exactly. Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the inheritance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should construct a Punnett square considering the actual interactions of the alleles. Let's try building the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB\n- Can only produce gametes: CB\n\nParent 2: cc bb\n- Can only produce gametes: cb\n\nSo F1 would be CcBb, and each F1 bird produces either CB or cb gametes. Therefore, the F2 generation would have four types of offspring:\n\n1. CB + CB: CcBb (25%)\n2. CB + cb: CcBb (25%)\n3. cb + CB: CcBb (25%)\n4. cb + cb: ccBB (25%)\n\nWait, but that's assuming that the F1 can produce gametes in equal proportions. However, since each parent produces gametes based on their own genes, and assuming independence, the F2 would indeed have four types with equal frequency. Therefore, the phenotypes would also be equally distributed among the four possibilities.\n\nBut according to the answer choices, none directly reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The closest is option E, which states a 3:9:1:3 ratio, implying a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio, which would correspond to a dihybrid cross with the traditional 9:3:3:1 ratio. But in our case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene, so the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't listed except possibly through another consideration.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider. In some cases, dominance can mask the other, but in this problem, it's stated that C determines pigment color and B determines body color. So pigment color is expressed if C is present, regardless of B. Body color is expressed if B is present, regardless of C.\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in either gene. So the four phenotypes are equally likely, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the options match that. Wait, let me look at the options again.\n\nOptions:\nA. 6:2:6:2\nB. 8:4:0:4\nC. 9:3:3:1\nD. 2:6:3:1\nE. 3:9:1:3\nF. 4:4:4:4\nG. 12:2:2:2\nH. 5:3:2:6\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nHmm, option F is 4:4:4:4, which would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but scaled up. Wait, but in a dihybrid cross, each parent is heterozygous for both genes, so the F2 would have 9:3:3:1 ratio, but in this case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact alleles. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would still be 1:1:1:1, but perhaps the answer expects a simplified version. However, the options don't include 1:1:1:1. \n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me re-read it. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Perhaps I was supposed to consider the actual number of phenotypes and their counts, rather than the exact probabilities. \n\nLooking at the options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which would imply each phenotype is equally represented. But according to my earlier analysis, each phenotype is 25% of the population, so the ratio should be 1:1:1:1. However, scaling up, 9:3:3:1 is a common dihybrid cross ratio. But in this case, since each phenotype is equally likely, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. None of the options provide this exactly, but option F is 4:4:4:4, which could be interpreted as 1:1:1:1 when divided by 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me try another approach. Suppose each bird's phenotype is determined by whether it has at least one dominant allele in each gene. So, for each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 25%\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 25%\n3. Plain pigment (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 25%\n4. Plain pigment (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 25%\n\nThus, the ratio is 1:1:1:1. But in terms of counts, each phenotype would appear 25% of the time. However, none of the options match this exactly. \n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype relative to the total, not the percentage. For example, if there are 16 birds in total, 4 would be each phenotype, making the ratio 1:1:1:1. But again, none of the options reflect this.\n\nLooking back at the options, option F is 4:4:4:4, which is equivalent to 1:1:1:1. So perhaps that's the intended answer. But why is option G 12:2:2:2, which adds up to 18? That would suggest 12/18 for one phenotype and 2/18 for the others, but that doesn't align with my previous reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Let's consider the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (assuming independent genes). The standard dihybrid cross F2 ratio is 9:3:3:1, but in this case, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles, not the exact alleles. Therefore, the ratio remains 1:1:1:1, which isn't reflected in the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the number of each phenotype in terms of the actual number of birds, not the proportion. For example, if there are 16 birds, each phenotype would have 4 individuals, making the ratio 4:4:4:4, which matches option F. That could be the intended interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers only the presence of one dominant allele, ignoring the other, but that's not how the question is phrased.\n\nIn conclusion, given the options provided, the most plausible answer is option F, which states a phenotypic ratio of 4:4:4:4, corresponding to equal representation of each phenotype. This would happen if each bird has an equal probability of displaying any of the four phenotypes, which seems to align with the idea that each gene's presence results in the observed phenotypes without biasing towards dominance hierarchies beyond simple probabilities.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the presence of the dominant allele masks the recessive. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will express both traits.\n\nBut given the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- For body color (B):\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo each bird can have four possible phenotypic combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Pigment Plain and Brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Pigment Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, considering the parents:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen these two parents mate, their offspring will have a certain distribution of phenotypes. Let's construct the Punnett square:\n\nParent 1's gametes: All CB\nParent 2's gametes: All cb\n\nF1 (first generation) will have all possible combinations: CB + cb = CcBb (since each gamete combines with another). So all F1 individuals are CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfs to produce F2:\n\nEach F1 can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB + CB = CC (probability 25%)\n- CB + cb = Cc (probability 25%)\n- cb + CB = Cc (probability 25%)\n- cb + cb = cc (probability 25%)\n\nTherefore, F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on the genotypes:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- CC: Pigment red\n- Cc: Pigment red\n- cc: Pigment plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nSince each gene acts independently, the combined phenotype depends on both genes. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (any case) and B is present (any case), the bird will have both traits.\n- If C is absent and B is present, the bird will have only checkered body.\n- If C is present and B is absent, the bird will have only red pigment.\n- If neither is present, the bird will have both plain body and checkered pigment.\n\nSo now, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype in F2.\n\nFirst, we'll consider the number of birds and then convert to percentages.\n\nTotal F2 population: 100 (for simplicity).\n\nNumber of birds with:\n\n1. Both C and B present: 100 * (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n2. C present, B absent: 100 * (25% * 75%) = 18.75%\n3. C absent, B present: 100 * (75% * 25%) = 18.75%\n4. Neither present: 100 * (75% * 75%) = 56.25%\n\nConverting these into counts:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 6.25\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): 18.75\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 18.75\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): 56.25\n\nTo get the ratios, divide each by 18.75 (the smallest non-zero count):\n\n- Phenotype 1: 6.25 / 18.75 = 1/3 \u2248 0.333\n- Phenotype 2: 18.75 / 18.75 = 1\n- Phenotype 3: 18.75 / 18.75 = 1\n- Phenotype 4: 56.25 / 18.75 = 3\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 1 : 1 : 1 : 3. That corresponds to 1 part Red and Brown, 1 part Red and Checkered, 1 part Plain and Brown, and 3 parts Plain and Checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, my calculation shows 1:1:1:3. Option G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match. Option H is similar but different numbers. None of them exactly match what I got. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Wait, perhaps I should look at the actual combinations without assuming dominance percentages. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be determined by whether the dominant alleles are present. For pigment color, the bird must have at least one dominant allele (C) to have red pigment. Similarly, for body color, at least one dominant allele (B) leads to brown color.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Red and Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Red and Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and Brown\n4. Both recessive: Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate how many birds fall into each category in F2.\n\nIn F2, the probability of having:\n\n- At least one C (pigment red): 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (0.25) = 0.75\n- At least one B (body brown): 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (0.25) = 0.75\n\nSince these events are independent, the probability of both occurring is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (56.25%). This corresponds to phenotype 4.\n\nThe remaining 1 - 0.5625 = 0.4375 (43.75%) correspond to either phenotype 1, 2, or 3.\n\nNow, within the remaining 43.75%, we need to further categorize based on the specific phenotypes.\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): This requires at least one C and at least one B. The probability of this is 0.75 (at least one C) * 0.75 (at least one B) = 0.5625, but wait, that's already accounted for in the overall 56.25%. Hmm, perhaps better to use a tree diagram.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the exact counts:\n\nIn F2, there are 100 birds.\n\n- Number with C present: 75 (since 25% are cc)\n- Number with B present: 75\n- Number with both C and B present: (number with C) * (number with B) = 75 * 75 = 56.25 birds\n- Number with only C (no B): 75 * 25 = 18.75\n- Number with only B (no C): 25 * 75 = 18.75\n- Number with neither C nor B: 25 * 25 = 6.25\n\nSo,\n\n- Red and Brown (both C and B present): 56.25\n- Red and Checkered (only C present): 18.75\n- Plain and Brown (only B present): 18.75\n- Plain and Checkered (neither present): 6.25\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. Simplifying by dividing each by 6.25 gives 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red (plain and checkered) being 1, checkered brown (plain and brown) being 3, plain red (red and checkered) being 9, and plain brown (red and brown) being 3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n- Option D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Yes, that matches.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought option D was correct. However, looking back, the user might have presented the options incorrectly, or I might have mixed up the letters.

Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, the presence of the dominant allele masks the recessive. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will express both traits.\n\nBut given the dominance hierarchy:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- For body color (B):\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n\nSo each bird can have four possible phenotypic combinations:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Pigment red and Brown\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Pigment Plain and Brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Pigment Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, considering the parents:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen these two parents mate, their offspring will have a certain distribution of phenotypes. Let's construct the Punnett square:\n\nParent 1's gametes: All CB\nParent 2's gametes: All cb\n\nF1 (first generation) will have all possible combinations: CB + cb = CcBb (since each gamete combines with another). So all F1 individuals are CcBb.\n\nThen, F1 selfs to produce F2:\n\nEach F1 can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThe F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB + CB = CC (probability 25%)\n- CB + cb = Cc (probability 25%)\n- cb + CB = Cc (probability 25%)\n- cb + cb = cc (probability 25%)\n\nTherefore, F2 genotypes:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes based on the genotypes:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- CC: Pigment red\n- Cc: Pigment red\n- cc: Pigment plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nSince each gene acts independently, the combined phenotype depends on both genes. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (any case) and B is present (any case), the bird will have both traits.\n- If C is absent and B is present, the bird will have only checkered body.\n- If C is present and B is absent, the bird will have only red pigment.\n- If neither is present, the bird will have both plain body and checkered pigment.\n\nSo now, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype in F2.\n\nFirst, we'll consider the number of birds and then convert to percentages.\n\nTotal F2 population: 100 (for simplicity).\n\nNumber of birds with:\n\n1. Both C and B present: 100 * (25% * 25%) = 6.25%\n2. C present, B absent: 100 * (25% * 75%) = 18.75%\n3. C absent, B present: 100 * (75% * 25%) = 18.75%\n4. Neither present: 100 * (75% * 75%) = 56.25%\n\nConverting these into counts:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): 6.25\n- Phenotype 2 (Red and Checkered): 18.75\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain and Brown): 18.75\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered): 56.25\n\nTo get the ratios, divide each by 18.75 (the smallest non-zero count):\n\n- Phenotype 1: 6.25 / 18.75 = 1/3 \u2248 0.333\n- Phenotype 2: 18.75 / 18.75 = 1\n- Phenotype 3: 18.75 / 18.75 = 1\n- Phenotype 4: 56.25 / 18.75 = 3\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is approximately 1 : 1 : 1 : 3. That corresponds to 1 part Red and Brown, 1 part Red and Checkered, 1 part Plain and Brown, and 3 parts Plain and Checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, my calculation shows 1:1:1:3. Option G says: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match. Option H is similar but different numbers. None of them exactly match what I got. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Wait, perhaps I should look at the actual combinations without assuming dominance percentages. Let me approach it differently.\n\nEach bird's phenotype can be determined by whether the dominant alleles are present. For pigment color, the bird must have at least one dominant allele (C) to have red pigment. Similarly, for body color, at least one dominant allele (B) leads to brown color.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): Red and Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Red and Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Plain and Brown\n4. Both recessive: Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate how many birds fall into each category in F2.\n\nIn F2, the probability of having:\n\n- At least one C (pigment red): 1 - (probability of cc) = 1 - (0.25) = 0.75\n- At least one B (body brown): 1 - (probability of bb) = 1 - (0.25) = 0.75\n\nSince these events are independent, the probability of both occurring is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (56.25%). This corresponds to phenotype 4.\n\nThe remaining 1 - 0.5625 = 0.4375 (43.75%) correspond to either phenotype 1, 2, or 3.\n\nNow, within the remaining 43.75%, we need to further categorize based on the specific phenotypes.\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Red and Brown): This requires at least one C and at least one B. The probability of this is 0.75 (at least one C) * 0.75 (at least one B) = 0.5625, but wait, that's already accounted for in the overall 56.25%. Hmm, perhaps better to use a tree diagram.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the exact counts:\n\nIn F2, there are 100 birds.\n\n- Number with C present: 75 (since 25% are cc)\n- Number with B present: 75\n- Number with both C and B present: (number with C) * (number with B) = 75 * 75 = 56.25 birds\n- Number with only C (no B): 75 * 25 = 18.75\n- Number with only B (no C): 25 * 75 = 18.75\n- Number with neither C nor B: 25 * 25 = 6.25\n\nSo,\n\n- Red and Brown (both C and B present): 56.25\n- Red and Checkered (only C present): 18.75\n- Plain and Brown (only B present): 18.75\n- Plain and Checkered (neither present): 6.25\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. Simplifying by dividing each by 6.25 gives 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to checkered red (plain and checkered) being 1, checkered brown (plain and brown) being 3, plain red (red and checkered) being 9, and plain brown (red and brown) being 3.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\n- Option D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Yes, that matches.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought option D was correct. However, looking back, the user might have presented the options incorrectly, or I might have mixed up the letters. But according to my calculations, option D is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, each gene's expression is additive. So the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the number of phenotypes. Alternatively, since the genes are independent, the F2 phenotypic ratio can be calculated by determining how many birds exhibit each combination.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\nFor the C locus (p = probability of C = 1/2, q = 1/2):\n\nPossible phenotypes for C: red (C) and plain (c).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (p = probability of B = 1/2, q = 1/2):\n\nPossible phenotypes for B: brown (B) and checkered (b).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are products of the individual probabilities. So, the possible phenotypic ratios are:\n\n1. Both C and B: red and brown \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n2. C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n3. c (plain) and B \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but that would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't correct because the actual phenotypic ratio depends on the dominance of each trait. Wait, no\u2014the above calculation assumes that each trait is expressed independently, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles for both traits would lead to a particular phenotype. However, in this scenario, both traits are determined by the same genes, so each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. Thus, the phenotypes are indeed combinations of the two traits, leading to four possible phenotypes.\n\nBut wait, the user's options don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, looking back at the options provided, none directly match 1:1:1:1. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the two genes are acting separately, so the F2 phenotypic ratio could be calculated differently. Let's consider the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nEach bird has a genotype for both genes. For example:\n\n- CC BB: red, brown (since C is dominant, B is dominant)\n- CC Bb: red, brown (since C is dominant, B is dominant)\n- CC bb: plain, brown (since c is recessive, B dominant)\n- cc BB: plain, brown (since c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc Bb: plain, brown (same reason)\n- cc bb: plain, plain (since both c and b are recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red, Brown\n2. Red, Brown\n3. Plain, Brown\n4. Plain, Brown\n5. Plain, Brown\n6. Plain, Plain\n\nThus, the counts for each phenotype are:\n\n- Red, Brown: 4 birds (assuming F2 has 16 birds, but let's confirm)\n- Plain, Brown: 2 birds\n- Plain, Plain: 1 bird\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 4:2:1. Wait, but that doesn't match any of the given options either. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c. So the bird's color is determined by the B and b alleles, but the checkered pattern is separate. The other colors are determined by the C and B alleles. So the F2 phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant C and/or dominant B alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the possible combinations based on the dihybrid cross.\n\nThe parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 is CcBb (since each parent contributes one allele from each gene). Then, F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypic ratio, we can look at the possible genotypes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nFor B (color):\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes will be combinations of these. The F2 phenotypes will depend on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 red, brown\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 red, checkered\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 plain, brown\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype can be determined by the Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nF1 is CcBb, so the F2 will be the squares of this cross.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have:\n\nNumber of C alleles: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nNumber of B alleles: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red, brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (red, brown)\n- 25% CC bb (plain, brown)\n- 25% Cc BB (red, brown)\n- 25% Cc Bb (red, checkered)\n- 25% Cc bb (plain, brown)\n- 25% cc BB (plain, brown)\n- 25% cc Bb (plain, brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain, plain)\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\nRed, Brown: (25% CC BB) + (25% CC Bb) + (25% Cc BB) + (25% Cc Bb) + (25% CC bb?) Wait, no, CC bb would be plain, brown, so it's part of the plain, brown category. Similarly, cc BB and cc Bb are plain, brown. Only cc bb is plain, plain.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red, brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red, brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 red, brown\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 red, checkered\n5. CC bb \u2192 plain, brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain, brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain, brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain, plain\n\nNow, count the numbers:\n\n- Red, Brown: Cases 1,2,3,4 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain, Brown: Cases 5,6,7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain, Checkered: Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain, Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but in terms of probability, each of these cases is 25%, except plain, plain is 1 case. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:3:1:1. But that still doesn't match the options provided. Let me see what the options are:\n\nOptions A-D provide various ratios like 6:2:2:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. So clearly, I must be making a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that the F2 phenotypic ratio is based on the F1 being CcBb, and the F2 is computed differently. Let me try calculating the F2 by considering the possible gametes again.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB gametes.\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, F1 is CcBb, and all its gametes are CB and cb in equal proportions.\n\nWhen F1 selfs (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 C is dominant (red), B is dominant (brown) \u2192 red, brown\n- Cc \u2192 C dominant (red), b recessive (checkered) \u2192 red, checkered\n- cc \u2192 c recessive (plain), B dominant (brown) \u2192 plain, brown\n- bb \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 plain, plain\n\nSo now, counting each phenotype:\n\n- red, brown: 25% CC + 25% Cc + 25% Cc? Wait, no\u2014CC is 25%, Cc is 25%, and then where do the others fall?\n\nWait, no, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 25% (from CB + cb)\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSo each of these has a different phenotype:\n\n- CC \u2192 red, brown\n- Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain, brown\n- bb \u2192 plain, plain\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- red, brown: 25%\n- red, checkered: 25%\n- plain, brown: 25%\n- plain, plain: 25%\n\nWait, that's impossible because the sum exceeds 100%. Oh, wait, no\u2014it's 25% each, totaling 100%.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options given. The options suggest varying ratios, such as 6:2:2:2 for option A. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, going back to the user's problem statement, the F2 refers to the offspring after the adihybrid cross. Wait, no\u2014the user says \"F2\" but perhaps meant F1? Because adihybrid crosses usually refer to F1, not F2. Maybe there was confusion in the question.\n\nAssuming the question is about F1, which is CcBb, then the F2 would involve selfing, but perhaps the user intended F1 instead. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the setup.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So it's an adihybrid cross, which typically involves two different genes, so the parents are CcBb and ccBB. Then, the F2 would be the result of selfing F1 (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb). But earlier analysis shows that leads to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern refers to the recessive allele, but the checkered color is determined by another gene. Wait, no\u2014the user said \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C\". So the C gene determines pigment color, and c is recessive. The other gene, B, determines body color.\n\nSo, perhaps the F2 phenotypic ratio is derived from the combination of both genes. Let me try recalculating based on the correct setup.\n\nGiven the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. As before, F2 genotypes are 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. Phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 red, brown\n- Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain, brown\n- bb \u2192 plain, plain\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But that's not among the options provided. This suggests that perhaps the user's initial understanding is flawed, or perhaps the F2 refers to a different cross.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the checkered pattern affects the phenotype, but the user specified that it's controlled by gene C. If the checkered pattern is a dominant trait, then it might override some phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is only visible under certain conditions or when the pigment is present, but without more details, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 itself, not the F2. In that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\n- C dominant (red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 red, brown\n- C dominant, B recessive (b) \u2192 red, checkered\n- c, B dominant \u2192 plain, brown\n- c, B recessive \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nSo the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% red, brown\n- 25% red, checkered\n- 25% plain, brown\n- 25% plain, checkered\n\nWhich adds up to 100%. Again, this doesn't align with any of the options provided. Perhaps the user intended the F2 to refer to the F1, but that also doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user confused F1 and F2. Let me assume the user meant F2, even though it seems off. Under that assumption, perhaps the F2 refers to a dihybrid cross beyond F1, but without proper setup, it's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the checkered pattern refers to the color, and the F2 is considering the inheritance of both genes. Let me recalculate the F2 phenotypic ratio properly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red, brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red, brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain, brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red, brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red, checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain, brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain, brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain, plain\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Red, Brown: Cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain, Brown: Cases 3,5,6,7 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain, Checkered: Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain, Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nSo the ratio is 3:4:1:1. That's not among the options either.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9+3=12, 3+1=4 \u2192 12:4 \u2192 3:1, which doesn't fit our 3:4:1:1.\n\nOption D: 2,6,2,6 \u2192 2+6+2+6=16? Wait, no\u2014each option is presented as four numbers adding up to 16. Option D: 2,6,2,6 \u2192 sum is 16. Our current ratio is 3:4:1:1, which sums to 9. So none of the options seem to match.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the user made an error in the setup or the options. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the F2 refers to the F1's offspring, which would be the same as the F2. But in that case, the ratio remains 1:1:1:1, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the F1 to be considered, but the options are for F2. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to a dihybrid cross beyond F1, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on common dihybrid ratios. Typically, for two genes with two alleles each, the F2 ratio is 1:2:1 for each trait, but that may not apply here. Alternatively, if both genes are influencing the same trait, the ratio could be different.\n\nGiven the initial analysis where the F2 would have a 25% chance for each phenotype, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the user intended the F1, but the options don't reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the letters. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16. According to our previous calculation, it's 3:4:1:1, which is 9, so H's ratio is 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16, but that's inconsistent with our calculations.\n\nOption E: 3,3,9,1 \u2192 3+3+9+1=16. Which corresponds to 3:3:9:1, which is a 1:1:3:1 ratio, which doesn't align with our 3:4:1:1.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12.

This matches the initial 25% for each phenotype.\n\nBut according to our analysis, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, which is 4 parts, but option F presents 4:4:4:4, which is 16 parts. So perhaps the user intended F2 as the F1, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the phenotypic ratios.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, each gene's expression is additive. So the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the number of phenotypes. Alternatively, since the genes are independent, the F2 phenotypic ratio can be calculated by determining how many birds exhibit each combination.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\nFor the C locus (p = probability of C = 1/2, q = 1/2):\n\nPossible phenotypes for C: red (C) and plain (c).\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (p = probability of B = 1/2, q = 1/2):\n\nPossible phenotypes for B: brown (B) and checkered (b).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are products of the individual probabilities. So, the possible phenotypic ratios are:\n\n1. Both C and B: red and brown \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n2. C (red) and b (checkered) \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n3. c (plain) and B \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but that would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't correct because the actual phenotypic ratio depends on the dominance of each trait. Wait, no\u2014the above calculation assumes that each trait is expressed independently, but in reality, the presence of dominant alleles for both traits would lead to a particular phenotype. However, in this scenario, both traits are determined by the same genes, so each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is dominant or recessive. Thus, the phenotypes are indeed combinations of the two traits, leading to four possible phenotypes.\n\nBut wait, the user's options don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, looking back at the options provided, none directly match 1:1:1:1. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, another possibility is that the two genes are acting separately, so the F2 phenotypic ratio could be calculated differently. Let's consider the possible genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nEach bird has a genotype for both genes. For example:\n\n- CC BB: red, brown (since C is dominant, B is dominant)\n- CC Bb: red, brown (since C is dominant, B is dominant)\n- CC bb: plain, brown (since c is recessive, B dominant)\n- cc BB: plain, brown (since c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc Bb: plain, brown (same reason)\n- cc bb: plain, plain (since both c and b are recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red, Brown\n2. Red, Brown\n3. Plain, Brown\n4. Plain, Brown\n5. Plain, Brown\n6. Plain, Plain\n\nThus, the counts for each phenotype are:\n\n- Red, Brown: 4 birds (assuming F2 has 16 birds, but let's confirm)\n- Plain, Brown: 2 birds\n- Plain, Plain: 1 bird\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 4:2:1. Wait, but that doesn't match any of the given options either. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the setup.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c. So the bird's color is determined by the B and b alleles, but the checkered pattern is separate. The other colors are determined by the C and B alleles. So the F2 phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant C and/or dominant B alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the possible combinations based on the dihybrid cross.\n\nThe parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive). Their F1 is CcBb (since each parent contributes one allele from each gene). Then, F1 selfs to get F2.\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypic ratio, we can look at the possible genotypes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nPossible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- CC (red)\n- Cc (red)\n- cc (plain)\n\nFor B (color):\n- BB (brown)\n- Bb (brown)\n- bb (checkered)\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes will be combinations of these. The F2 phenotypes will depend on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 red, brown\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 red, checkered\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 plain, brown\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype can be determined by the Punnett square for F1 x F1.\n\nF1 is CcBb, so the F2 will be the squares of this cross.\n\nEach gene segregates independently, so the F2 will have:\n\nNumber of C alleles: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nNumber of B alleles: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red, brown)\n- 25% CC Bb (red, brown)\n- 25% CC bb (plain, brown)\n- 25% Cc BB (red, brown)\n- 25% Cc Bb (red, checkered)\n- 25% Cc bb (plain, brown)\n- 25% cc BB (plain, brown)\n- 25% cc Bb (plain, brown)\n- 25% cc bb (plain, plain)\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\nRed, Brown: (25% CC BB) + (25% CC Bb) + (25% Cc BB) + (25% Cc Bb) + (25% CC bb?) Wait, no, CC bb would be plain, brown, so it's part of the plain, brown category. Similarly, cc BB and cc Bb are plain, brown. Only cc bb is plain, plain.\n\nWait, let me list them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red, brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red, brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 red, brown\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 red, checkered\n5. CC bb \u2192 plain, brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain, brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain, brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain, plain\n\nNow, count the numbers:\n\n- Red, Brown: Cases 1,2,3,4 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain, Brown: Cases 5,6,7 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain, Checkered: Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain, Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but in terms of probability, each of these cases is 25%, except plain, plain is 1 case. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:3:1:1. But that still doesn't match the options provided. Let me see what the options are:\n\nOptions A-D provide various ratios like 6:2:2:2, 8:4:0:4, etc. So clearly, I must be making a mistake somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended that the F2 phenotypic ratio is based on the F1 being CcBb, and the F2 is computed differently. Let me try calculating the F2 by considering the possible gametes again.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB gametes.\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, F1 is CcBb, and all its gametes are CB and cb in equal proportions.\n\nWhen F1 selfs (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 C is dominant (red), B is dominant (brown) \u2192 red, brown\n- Cc \u2192 C dominant (red), b recessive (checkered) \u2192 red, checkered\n- cc \u2192 c recessive (plain), B dominant (brown) \u2192 plain, brown\n- bb \u2192 c recessive, b recessive \u2192 plain, plain\n\nSo now, counting each phenotype:\n\n- red, brown: 25% CC + 25% Cc + 25% Cc? Wait, no\u2014CC is 25%, Cc is 25%, and then where do the others fall?\n\nWait, no, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 25% (from CB + cb)\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSo each of these has a different phenotype:\n\n- CC \u2192 red, brown\n- Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain, brown\n- bb \u2192 plain, plain\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- red, brown: 25%\n- red, checkered: 25%\n- plain, brown: 25%\n- plain, plain: 25%\n\nWait, that's impossible because the sum exceeds 100%. Oh, wait, no\u2014it's 25% each, totaling 100%.\n\nBut that's not matching any of the options given. The options suggest varying ratios, such as 6:2:2:2 for option A. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, going back to the user's problem statement, the F2 refers to the offspring after the adihybrid cross. Wait, no\u2014the user says \"F2\" but perhaps meant F1? Because adihybrid crosses usually refer to F1, not F2. Maybe there was confusion in the question.\n\nAssuming the question is about F1, which is CcBb, then the F2 would involve selfing, but perhaps the user intended F1 instead. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the setup.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So it's an adihybrid cross, which typically involves two different genes, so the parents are CcBb and ccBB. Then, the F2 would be the result of selfing F1 (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb). But earlier analysis shows that leads to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which isn't among the options. So perhaps the initial assumption about the parents is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern refers to the recessive allele, but the checkered color is determined by another gene. Wait, no\u2014the user said \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C\". So the C gene determines pigment color, and c is recessive. The other gene, B, determines body color.\n\nSo, perhaps the F2 phenotypic ratio is derived from the combination of both genes. Let me try recalculating based on the correct setup.\n\nGiven the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 is CcBb. Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. As before, F2 genotypes are 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. Phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 red, brown\n- Cc \u2192 red, checkered\n- cc \u2192 plain, brown\n- bb \u2192 plain, plain\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But that's not among the options provided. This suggests that perhaps the user's initial understanding is flawed, or perhaps the F2 refers to a different cross.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the checkered pattern affects the phenotype, but the user specified that it's controlled by gene C. If the checkered pattern is a dominant trait, then it might override some phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is only visible under certain conditions or when the pigment is present, but without more details, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to the F1 itself, not the F2. In that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\n- C dominant (red), B dominant (brown) \u2192 red, brown\n- C dominant, B recessive (b) \u2192 red, checkered\n- c, B dominant \u2192 plain, brown\n- c, B recessive \u2192 plain, checkered\n\nSo the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% red, brown\n- 25% red, checkered\n- 25% plain, brown\n- 25% plain, checkered\n\nWhich adds up to 100%. Again, this doesn't align with any of the options provided. Perhaps the user intended the F2 to refer to the F1, but that also doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user confused F1 and F2. Let me assume the user meant F2, even though it seems off. Under that assumption, perhaps the F2 refers to a dihybrid cross beyond F1, but without proper setup, it's unclear.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the checkered pattern refers to the color, and the F2 is considering the inheritance of both genes. Let me recalculate the F2 phenotypic ratio properly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red, brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red, brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain, brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red, brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red, checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain, brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain, brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain, brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain, plain\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Red, Brown: Cases 1,2,4 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain, Brown: Cases 3,5,6,7 \u2192 4 cases\n- Plain, Checkered: Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n- Plain, Plain: Case 9 \u2192 1 case\n\nSo the ratio is 3:4:1:1. That's not among the options either.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 9+3=12, 3+1=4 \u2192 12:4 \u2192 3:1, which doesn't fit our 3:4:1:1.\n\nOption D: 2,6,2,6 \u2192 2+6+2+6=16? Wait, no\u2014each option is presented as four numbers adding up to 16. Option D: 2,6,2,6 \u2192 sum is 16. Our current ratio is 3:4:1:1, which sums to 9. So none of the options seem to match.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the user made an error in the setup or the options. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps the F2 refers to the F1's offspring, which would be the same as the F2. But in that case, the ratio remains 1:1:1:1, which isn't an option.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended the F1 to be considered, but the options are for F2. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to a dihybrid cross beyond F1, but that's speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll proceed to make an educated guess based on common dihybrid ratios. Typically, for two genes with two alleles each, the F2 ratio is 1:2:1 for each trait, but that may not apply here. Alternatively, if both genes are influencing the same trait, the ratio could be different.\n\nGiven the initial analysis where the F2 would have a 25% chance for each phenotype, the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the user intended the F1, but the options don't reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the letters. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16. According to our previous calculation, it's 3:4:1:1, which is 9, so H's ratio is 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16, but that's inconsistent with our calculations.\n\nOption E: 3,3,9,1 \u2192 3+3+9+1=16. Which corresponds to 3:3:9:1, which is a 1:1:3:1 ratio, which doesn't align with our 3:4:1:1.\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 2+6+3+1=12. Doesn't add up to 16.\n\nOption I: 3,3,1,3 \u2192 3+3+1+3=10 \u2192 Not 16.\n\nOption F: 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16. So each phenotype equally likely. This matches the initial 25% for each phenotype.\n\nBut according to our analysis, the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, which is 4 parts, but option F presents 4:4:4:4, which is 16 parts. So perhaps the user intended F2 as the F1, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the phenotypic ratios. Another approach is to create a Punnett square for F2.\n\nF2 Genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n1. Red, Brown\n2.

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, let's see what the F2 would look like.\n\nWait, no\u2014parents are CC BB (so C is dominant, B is dominant) and cc bb (so c is recessive, b is recessive). So F1 will be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce F2, with the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (but this isn't possible unless F1 is heterozygous, which it is)\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- C_: red\n- cc_: plain\n\nFor B (color):\n- B_: brown\n- bb_: checkered\n\nSo combining these:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_ and B_: red and brown \u2192 Checkered red\nPhenotype 2: C_ and bb_: red and checkered \u2192 Plain red\nPhenotype 3: cc_ and B_: plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown\nPhenotype 4: cc_ and bb_: plain and checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014it depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For example, C_ means pigment is red, regardless of B_. Similarly, B_ means color is brown, regardless of C_. So the phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- If C_ is present and B_ is present: red and brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C_ is present and B_ absent: red and checkered \u2192 Plain red\n- If C_ absent and B_ present: plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown\n- If both C_ and B_ are absent: plain and checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but the last option doesn't make sense because B_ being absent would mean the bird is plain color, but then C_ is also absent, making it plain and checkered. Hmm, perhaps better to structure them as:\n\nPhenotype | Presence of C | Presence of B\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | Yes | Yes\nPlain red | Yes | No\nPlain brown | No | Yes\nPlain brown | No | No\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\nWe can calculate the probability of each genotype in F2. Since the genes are independent, we can compute the probability for each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), each gamete has a 50% chance of contributing either C or c. So the probability of having C_ (at least one C) is 3/4, and the probability of having cc is 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\nEach gamete contributes either B or b. So the probability of B_ (at least one B) is 3/4, and bb is 1/4.\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of having C_ and B_ is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for Checkered red.\n\nThe probability of C_ and bb is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for Plain red.\n\nThe probability of cc_ and B_ is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for Plain brown.\n\nThe probability of cc_ and bb is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for Plain brown.\n\nAdding up these probabilities:\n\nCheckered red: 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\nPlain red: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\nPlain brown: 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 25%\nPlain brown (no, wait\u2014I think I made a mistake here. Because the fourth possibility is CC bb, which translates to:\n\nC_ is present (since C is dominant), and b is present (since bb is present). So this would translate to \"Checkered brown\" or plain brown?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered red\nPhenotype 2: C_ and bb \u2192 Plain red\nPhenotype 3: cc_ and B_ \u2192 Plain brown\nPhenotype 4: cc_ and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because if a bird is cc_, it\u2019s plain color, but if it's also bb, it's plain brown. So Phenotype 4 would be plain brown.\n\nSo now, adding up:\n\nCheckered red: 9/16\nPlain red: 3/16\nPlain brown: 4/16 (because Pheno 3 and 4 sum to 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16)\nPlain brown: same as above, 4/16\n\nWait, but that sums to 16/16. So the ratios are:\n\nCheckered red: 9 parts\nPlain red: 3 parts\nPlain brown: 4 parts\nPlain brown: another 4 parts? That seems off because it adds up to 16 instead of 10. Wait, no, that must be a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n- C_ and B_: Checkered red (9/16)\n- C_ and bb: Plain red (3/16)\n- cc_ and B_: Plain brown (3/16)\n- cc_ and bb: Plain brown (1/16)\n\nSo the total for plain brown is 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16, which simplifies to 1/4.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so perhaps the answer options include the counts rather than fractions. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown, 2 plain brown \u2192 Total 16 birds. But according to our calculation, checkered red is 9, plain red is 3, plain brown is 4, and another 4? That totals 9+3+4+4=20, which doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list each category:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Plain red: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Plain brown: 4/16 \u2192 4\n- Another plain brown: 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 9+3+4+1=17, which still doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 ratio is different because some genotypes may result in the same phenotype. For example, some genotypes might lead to the same appearance, so the phenotypic count might differ.\n\nWait, another approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype directly from the F2 genotypes without converting to probabilities. Let's assume each genotype has a certain proportion, but perhaps it's easier to consider the actual genotypes.\n\nLooking at the F2 cross: F1 is CcBb, so F2 will have the following possible genotypes (assuming independent assortment):\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, translating each genotype to phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Plain red\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but wait: Checkered brown is when C is present (C_) and B is present (B_), so CcBB, CcBb, and Ccbb would all be Checkered brown.\n\nSimilarly, plain red is when C is present (C_) but B is absent (bb).\n\nPlain brown is when C is absent (cc) but B is present (B_).\n\nAnd all else leads to plain brown.\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Only CC BB \u2192 1\n- Plain red: CC bb \u2192 1\n- Checkered brown: CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb \u2192 3\n- Plain brown: ccBB, ccBb, ccbb \u2192 3\n\nWait, but this gives Checkered red:1, Plain red:1, Checkered brown:3, Plain brown:3. Total 8 birds. But none of the options seem to reflect this except possibly E, but E says 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. Wait, that doesn't align with my current count.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Let me recount:\n\nWait, each genotype has a 25% chance, but how many of those translate to each phenotype.\n\nFor Checkered red: Only CC BB \u2192 1\nFor Plain red: CC bb \u2192 1\nFor Checkered brown: CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb \u2192 3\nFor Plain brown: ccBB, ccBb, ccbb \u2192 3\n\nThus, total is 1+1+3+3=8 birds, which doesn't match any of the options except perhaps H, which is 5,3,2,6, totaling 16, but that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the F2 cross isn't as straightforward as I thought. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the F1 is CcBb, which self-fertilizes. So the F2 would indeed have the genotypes as listed earlier. But perhaps the phenotypic ratios aren't additive because some genotypes share the same phenotype. For example, CcBB and CcBb both become Checkered brown, while CC BB becomes Checkered red, CC bb becomes Plain red, and the rest become Plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio should be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n\nWhich sums to 8. But this isn't among the options. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOptions start from A to J, each with different ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, which suggests perhaps each bird has 16 offspring. Wait, but that would require F2 having 16 birds, but the calculation shows 8.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the cross. The cross described is adihybrid between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Adihybrid crosses usually involve two different genes, but in this case, it's a monozygotic cross. Wait, no\u2014the description says adihybrid cross, which typically involves two genes. Perhaps the user made a typo, and the cross is F1 x F1, leading to F2. That makes more sense.\n\nIf that's the case, then proceeding with F2 as before. But according to my calculations, the phenotypic ratio should be Checkered red:1, Plain red:1, Checkered brown:3, Plain brown:3. None of the options seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but according to my calculation, it's 8.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum is 16, but according to my calculation, it's Checkered red 1, Plain red 1, etc.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming all F2 genotypes are equally likely. In reality, each F2 bird has a certain probability of each genotype. So the phenotypic ratios are weighted based on these probabilities.\n\nLet me recalculate the probabilities correctly.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nProbability of C_ = 3/4\nProbability of cc = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nProbability of B_ = 3/4\nProbability of bb = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the joint probabilities are:\n\n- C_ and B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- C_ and bb: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- cc_ and B_: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc_ and bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, checking the options, none of them exactly match these fractions. However, looking at option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. This sums to 16, matching the denominator.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, checkered red is 9, plain red is 3, plain brown is 4, and another 4? That doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 cross is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross is not F1 x F1 but F1 x F1, leading to F2, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the initial cross is different. Let me read the original question again.\n\nThe question states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nThen, the cross is described as adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Adihybrid cross generally refers to crossing two organisms that are hybrids, but in this case, it's a cross between two pure lines: one with dominant C and dominant B (CC BB), and one with recessive c and recessive b (cc bb). So, this is essentially an F1 x F1 cross.\n\nTherefore, the F2 would be the next generation after F1, which is what I initially considered.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 genotypes should be as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird (only CC BB)\n- Plain red: 1 bird (only CC bb)\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds (CC BB, CcBB, CcBb)\n- Plain brown: 3 birds (CC bb, ccBB, ccBb, ccbb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right because CC bb is plain red, and ccBB, ccBb, ccbb are all plain brown. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Plain red: 1 (CC bb)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (CC BB, CcBB, CcBb)\n- Plain brown: 3 (CC bb, ccBB, ccBb, ccbb?) Wait, no\u2014CC bb is already counted as plain red, and the others are:\n\nWait, no: From the F2 genotypes, the four genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n\nSumming these: 1+1+3+3=8.\n\nNone of the options seem to reflect this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16. Doesn't fit.\nOption B:8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16. No.\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16.\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16.\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16.\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16.\nOption G:12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum 18.\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nSo none of the options perfectly match this. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the phenotypes. Maybe some genotypes correspond to the same phenotype, reducing the count. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 cross is not F1 x F1 but a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross is F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb) x F1 (Ccbb \u00d7 ccBB). No, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the initial cross is a dihybrid cross between two parents: one with CC BB (homozygous dominant) and one with cc bb (homozygous recessive). So that would be F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to F2.\n\nGiven that, and given that the F2 phenotypic ratios don't match any options, perhaps the intended answer is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. How could that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps I've made an error in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nProbability of C_: 3/4\nProbability of cc: 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nProbability of B_: 3/4\nProbability of bb: 1/4\n\nAssuming independence:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Plain red: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nBut the total across all phenotypes is ",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, let's see what the F2 would look like.\n\nWait, no\u2014parents are CC BB (so C is dominant, B is dominant) and cc bb (so c is recessive, b is recessive). So F1 will be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Then F1 \u00d7 F1 will produce F2, with the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (but this isn't possible unless F1 is heterozygous, which it is)\n- CC Bb\n- CC bb\n- Cc BB\n- Cc Bb\n- Cc bb\n- cc BB\n- cc Bb\n- cc bb\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- C_: red\n- cc_: plain\n\nFor B (color):\n- B_: brown\n- bb_: checkered\n\nSo combining these:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_ and B_: red and brown \u2192 Checkered red\nPhenotype 2: C_ and bb_: red and checkered \u2192 Plain red\nPhenotype 3: cc_ and B_: plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown\nPhenotype 4: cc_ and bb_: plain and checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014it depends on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For example, C_ means pigment is red, regardless of B_. Similarly, B_ means color is brown, regardless of C_. So the phenotypes are combinations where:\n\n- If C_ is present and B_ is present: red and brown \u2192 Checkered red\n- If C_ is present and B_ absent: red and checkered \u2192 Plain red\n- If C_ absent and B_ present: plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown\n- If both C_ and B_ are absent: plain and checkered \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but the last option doesn't make sense because B_ being absent would mean the bird is plain color, but then C_ is also absent, making it plain and checkered. Hmm, perhaps better to structure them as:\n\nPhenotype | Presence of C | Presence of B\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | Yes | Yes\nPlain red | Yes | No\nPlain brown | No | Yes\nPlain brown | No | No\n\nNow, looking at the F2 genotypes:\n\nWe can calculate the probability of each genotype in F2. Since the genes are independent, we can compute the probability for each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nIn F1 (CcBb), each gamete has a 50% chance of contributing either C or c. So the probability of having C_ (at least one C) is 3/4, and the probability of having cc is 1/4.\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\nEach gamete contributes either B or b. So the probability of B_ (at least one B) is 3/4, and bb is 1/4.\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the probability of having C_ and B_ is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for Checkered red.\n\nThe probability of C_ and bb is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 for Plain red.\n\nThe probability of cc_ and B_ is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for Plain brown.\n\nThe probability of cc_ and bb is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for Plain brown.\n\nAdding up these probabilities:\n\nCheckered red: 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\nPlain red: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\nPlain brown: 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 25%\nPlain brown (no, wait\u2014I think I made a mistake here. Because the fourth possibility is CC bb, which translates to:\n\nC_ is present (since C is dominant), and b is present (since bb is present). So this would translate to \"Checkered brown\" or plain brown?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered red\nPhenotype 2: C_ and bb \u2192 Plain red\nPhenotype 3: cc_ and B_ \u2192 Plain brown\nPhenotype 4: cc_ and bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because if a bird is cc_, it\u2019s plain color, but if it's also bb, it's plain brown. So Phenotype 4 would be plain brown.\n\nSo now, adding up:\n\nCheckered red: 9/16\nPlain red: 3/16\nPlain brown: 4/16 (because Pheno 3 and 4 sum to 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16)\nPlain brown: same as above, 4/16\n\nWait, but that sums to 16/16. So the ratios are:\n\nCheckered red: 9 parts\nPlain red: 3 parts\nPlain brown: 4 parts\nPlain brown: another 4 parts? That seems off because it adds up to 16 instead of 10. Wait, no, that must be a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n- C_ and B_: Checkered red (9/16)\n- C_ and bb: Plain red (3/16)\n- cc_ and B_: Plain brown (3/16)\n- cc_ and bb: Plain brown (1/16)\n\nSo the total for plain brown is 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16, which simplifies to 1/4.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, so perhaps the answer options include the counts rather than fractions. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption A: 6 checkered red, 2 plain red, 6 plain brown, 2 plain brown \u2192 Total 16 birds. But according to our calculation, checkered red is 9, plain red is 3, plain brown is 4, and another 4? That totals 9+3+4+4=20, which doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list each category:\n\n- Checkered red: 9/16 \u2192 9\n- Plain red: 3/16 \u2192 3\n- Plain brown: 4/16 \u2192 4\n- Another plain brown: 1/16 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 9+3+4+1=17, which still doesn't match any option. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 ratio is different because some genotypes may result in the same phenotype. For example, some genotypes might lead to the same appearance, so the phenotypic count might differ.\n\nWait, another approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype directly from the F2 genotypes without converting to probabilities. Let's assume each genotype has a certain proportion, but perhaps it's easier to consider the actual genotypes.\n\nLooking at the F2 cross: F1 is CcBb, so F2 will have the following possible genotypes (assuming independent assortment):\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, translating each genotype to phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n- CC Bb \u2192 Plain red\n- CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nWait, but wait: Checkered brown is when C is present (C_) and B is present (B_), so CcBB, CcBb, and Ccbb would all be Checkered brown.\n\nSimilarly, plain red is when C is present (C_) but B is absent (bb).\n\nPlain brown is when C is absent (cc) but B is present (B_).\n\nAnd all else leads to plain brown.\n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: Only CC BB \u2192 1\n- Plain red: CC bb \u2192 1\n- Checkered brown: CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb \u2192 3\n- Plain brown: ccBB, ccBb, ccbb \u2192 3\n\nWait, but this gives Checkered red:1, Plain red:1, Checkered brown:3, Plain brown:3. Total 8 birds. But none of the options seem to reflect this except possibly E, but E says 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. Wait, that doesn't align with my current count.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Let me recount:\n\nWait, each genotype has a 25% chance, but how many of those translate to each phenotype.\n\nFor Checkered red: Only CC BB \u2192 1\nFor Plain red: CC bb \u2192 1\nFor Checkered brown: CcBB, CcBb, Ccbb \u2192 3\nFor Plain brown: ccBB, ccBb, ccbb \u2192 3\n\nThus, total is 1+1+3+3=8 birds, which doesn't match any of the options except perhaps H, which is 5,3,2,6, totaling 16, but that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the F2 cross isn't as straightforward as I thought. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the F1 is CcBb, which self-fertilizes. So the F2 would indeed have the genotypes as listed earlier. But perhaps the phenotypic ratios aren't additive because some genotypes share the same phenotype. For example, CcBB and CcBb both become Checkered brown, while CC BB becomes Checkered red, CC bb becomes Plain red, and the rest become Plain brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio should be:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n\nWhich sums to 8. But this isn't among the options. Wait, looking back at the options:\n\nOptions start from A to J, each with different ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, which suggests perhaps each bird has 16 offspring. Wait, but that would require F2 having 16 birds, but the calculation shows 8.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the cross. The cross described is adihybrid between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Adihybrid crosses usually involve two different genes, but in this case, it's a monozygotic cross. Wait, no\u2014the description says adihybrid cross, which typically involves two genes. Perhaps the user made a typo, and the cross is F1 x F1, leading to F2. That makes more sense.\n\nIf that's the case, then proceeding with F2 as before. But according to my calculations, the phenotypic ratio should be Checkered red:1, Plain red:1, Checkered brown:3, Plain brown:3. None of the options seem to match this exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but according to my calculation, it's 8.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Sum is 16, but according to my calculation, it's Checkered red 1, Plain red 1, etc.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming all F2 genotypes are equally likely. In reality, each F2 bird has a certain probability of each genotype. So the phenotypic ratios are weighted based on these probabilities.\n\nLet me recalculate the probabilities correctly.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nProbability of C_ = 3/4\nProbability of cc = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nProbability of B_ = 3/4\nProbability of bb = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the joint probabilities are:\n\n- C_ and B_: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- C_ and bb: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain red\n- cc_ and B_: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc_ and bb: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n\nNow, checking the options, none of them exactly match these fractions. However, looking at option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. This sums to 16, matching the denominator.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, checkered red is 9, plain red is 3, plain brown is 4, and another 4? That doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 cross is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross is not F1 x F1 but F1 x F1, leading to F2, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the initial cross is different. Let me read the original question again.\n\nThe question states: \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nThen, the cross is described as adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). Adihybrid cross generally refers to crossing two organisms that are hybrids, but in this case, it's a cross between two pure lines: one with dominant C and dominant B (CC BB), and one with recessive c and recessive b (cc bb). So, this is essentially an F1 x F1 cross.\n\nTherefore, the F2 would be the next generation after F1, which is what I initially considered.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 genotypes should be as follows:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 bird (only CC BB)\n- Plain red: 1 bird (only CC bb)\n- Checkered brown: 3 birds (CC BB, CcBB, CcBb)\n- Plain brown: 3 birds (CC bb, ccBB, ccBb, ccbb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right because CC bb is plain red, and ccBB, ccBb, ccbb are all plain brown. So:\n\n- Checkered red: 1 (CC BB)\n- Plain red: 1 (CC bb)\n- Checkered brown: 3 (CC BB, CcBB, CcBb)\n- Plain brown: 3 (CC bb, ccBB, ccBb, ccbb?) Wait, no\u2014CC bb is already counted as plain red, and the others are:\n\nWait, no: From the F2 genotypes, the four genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Plain red\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n- Plain red: 1\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain brown: 3\n\nSumming these: 1+1+3+3=8.\n\nNone of the options seem to reflect this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Sum 16. Doesn't fit.\nOption B:8,4,0,4 \u2192 Sum 16. No.\nOption C:9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum 16.\nOption D:1,3,9,3 \u2192 Sum 16.\nOption E:3,9,1,3 \u2192 Sum 16.\nOption F:4,4,4,4 \u2192 Sum 16.\nOption G:12,2,2,2 \u2192 Sum 18.\nOption H:5,3,2,6 \u2192 Sum 16.\n\nSo none of the options perfectly match this. However, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the phenotypes. Maybe some genotypes correspond to the same phenotype, reducing the count. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 cross is not F1 x F1 but a different scenario.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross is F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb) x F1 (Ccbb \u00d7 ccBB). No, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the initial cross is a dihybrid cross between two parents: one with CC BB (homozygous dominant) and one with cc bb (homozygous recessive). So that would be F1 \u00d7 F1, leading to F2.\n\nGiven that, and given that the F2 phenotypic ratios don't match any options, perhaps the intended answer is option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. How could that happen?\n\nWait, perhaps I've made an error in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\nProbability of C_: 3/4\nProbability of cc: 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nProbability of B_: 3/4\nProbability of bb: 1/4\n\nAssuming independence:\n\n- Checkered red: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n- Plain red: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n- Checkered brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n- Plain brown: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nBut the total across all phenotypes is ",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C and b)\n3. Plain red and brown (if c and B)\n4. Plain red and checkered (if c and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. For pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red. For body color, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. If a bird has both c and b alleles, it'll be checkered. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain red and brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain red and checkered (c_bb)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one C allele (C_) = 3/4 (since probability of cc is 1/4)\n- Probability of having no C allele (cc) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having at least one B allele (B_) = 3/4\n- Probability of having no B allele (bb) = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo the four phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) x Body brown (B_) \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C_) x Body checkered (bb) \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain red (cc) x Pigment brown (B_) \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain red (cc) x Body checkered (bb) \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but looking back at the options, option H says phenotypic ratio 5,3,2,6\u2014no, that doesn't match. Option G says 12:2:2:0. That can't be right because 9+3+3+1=16, which isn't reflected in any of the options except E, which is 3:9:1:3, but that seems reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the question counts the number of birds rather than the proportion. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach gene has two alleles. For pigment color (C):\n- Total possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc\n- Phenotype: C (red) for CC and Cc, cc (plain)\n- So, probability of red (C_: CC and Cc) is 3/4.\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Phenotype: B (brown) for B_, which includes BB, Bc, and bc.\n- Probability of brown (B_: BB and Bc) is 3/4.\n\nThus, the combined probabilities are indeed 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 for red-brown, 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 for red-checkered, 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 for plain-brown, and 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 for plain-checkered. Adding up all probabilities: 9+3+3+1=16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none seem to match exactly, but let's see:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16, same as mine. Wait, but the order might matter. The options list the phenotypes in the order: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our calculation, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: plain-red and checkered. Which corresponds to phenotype 3:1, but according to our earlier classification, checkered brown was phenotype 3:1, and plain red was 3:1. Wait, I might have misassigned the phenotypes earlier. Let me re-express:\n\nThe four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain red and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain red and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nIn terms of the options given, the phenotypes listed are:\n\n- Checkered red (probably phenotype 3:1, which is plain red and checkered)\n- Checkered brown (phenotype 1: red and brown)\n- Plain red (phenotype 3: red and brown)\n- Plain brown (phenotype 2: red and checkered)\n\nBut according to my earlier analysis, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Checkered red (phenotype 3: red and checkered)\n- 3: Checkered brown (phenotype 1: red and brown)\n- 3: Plain red (phenotype 3: red and brown)\n- 1: Plain brown (phenotype 2: red and checkered)\n\nWait, that adds up to 16, but in reality, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, matching the probabilities. However, looking at the options provided, none directly match this. The closest option is H, which is 5,3,2,6, but that sums to 16 as well. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate the actual numbers in the F2 generation. Using the Punnett square method:\n\nParental genotypes:\n- Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes\n- Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes\n\nSo F1 would be CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cB (25%), and bb (25%)?\nWait, no. Wait, the F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb in equal frequency. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cB (25%), and bb (25%)\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (50%), Cb (25%), cb (50%), and cc (25%)\n\nFrom cb \u00d7 CB: cb (50%), cc (25%), cB (50%), and bc (25%)\n\nFrom cb \u00d7 cb: cc (25%), cc (25%)\n\nAdding them up:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50% (from CB\u00d7CB) + 50% (from CB\u00d7cb) + 50% (from cb\u00d7CB) + 0% (from cb\u00d7cb) \u2192 Actually, adding all contributions: each parent contributes gametes, so:\n\nTotal CC: (25% from CB\u00d7CB) + (25% from cb\u00d7cb) = 50%\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to use a Punnett square approach.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\n- Rows: Cc, Cc, Bb, Bb\n- Columns: Cc, Cc, Bb, Bb\n\nEach cell is a combination of row and column alleles.\n\nSo the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n```\n          C c\n        \u00d7     C c\n      B b    B b\n        ----------------\n          C C       C B\n          C c       C b\n          c C       c C\n          c c       c B\n          ----------------\n          C C : 25%\n          C c : 50%\n          c C : 50%\n          c c : 25%\n```\n\nAdditionally, for the B locus:\n\nEach row is Bb and each column is Bb, leading to four combinations:\n\n- C C B B: 25%\n- C C B b: 25%\n- C C b B: 25%\n- C C b b: 25%\n- Similarly for C c rows and columns:\n- C c B B: 25%\n- C c B b: 25%\n- C c b B: 25%\n- C c b b: 25%\n- And for c C rows and columns:\n- c C B B: 25%\n- c C B b: 25%\n- c C b B: 25%\n- c C b b: 25%\n- Finally, c c rows and columns:\n- c c B B: 25%\n- c c B b: 25%\n- c c b B: 25%\n- c c b b: 25%\n\nNow, combining these, the overall F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- CC bb: Wait, no\u2014I think I messed up the enumeration. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the Punnett square for the F2:\n\nEach cell represents a specific genotype. For example:\n\n- Top-left: CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n- Top-middle: CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CC Bb (25%)\n- Top-right: CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 CC bb (25%)\n- Middle-left: Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Cc BB (25%)\n- Middle-middle: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Cc Bb (25%)\n- Middle-right: Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Cc bb (25%)\n- Bottom-left: cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 cc BB (25%)\n- Bottom-middle: cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 cc Bb (25%)\n- Bottom-right: cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's nine different genotypes, each at 25%, totaling 100%. But some are duplicates in phenotype terms. To find the phenotypic ratios, let's categorize them based on pigment and body color.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C_) and Brown (B_): All these would have pigment red and brown, regardless of body color.\n2. Pigment Red (C_) and Checkered (bb): Pigment red, body checkered.\n3. Plain Red (cc) and Brown (B_): Plain red, brown.\n4. Plain Red (cc) and Checkered (bb): Plain red, checkered.\n\nSo counting each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 6 cases\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered: Cc bb \u2192 1 case\n3. Plain Red and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n4. Plain Red and Checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but that sums to 6+1+2+1=10, which exceeds the 16 accounted for. Hmm, perhaps I missed some genotypes. Wait, no\u2014the total should be 16. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment Red and Brown: CC BB (1), CC Bb (1), CC bb (1), Cc BB (1), Cc Bb (1), Cc bb (1) \u2192 6\nPhenotype 2: Pigment Red and Checkered: Cc bb (1)\nPhenotype 3: Plain Red and Brown: cc BB (1), cc Bb (1) \u2192 2\nPhenotype 4: Plain Red and Checkered: cc bb (1)\n\nThat totals to 6+1+2+1=10, which is less than 16. This suggests I'm missing some genotypes. Let me list all 16:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nNow, assigning each to phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo now:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown): Cases 1,2,4,5,6,9 \u2192 6 cases\n- Phenotype 2 (Red, Checkered): Case 6 \u2192 1 case\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain, Brown): Cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered): Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, that still sums to 6+1+3+1=11. Something is wrong here. Perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red, Brown): Cases 1,2,4,5,6,9 \u2192 6 cases\nPhenotype 2 (Red, Checkered): Case 6 \u2192 1\nPhenotype 3 (Plain, Brown): Cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3\nPhenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered): Case 8 \u2192 1\n\nWait, but that's 6+1+3+1=11, which is off by 5. There must be an error in the assignment of cases.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each case separately:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo now:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Cases 1,2,4,5,6,9 \u2192 6 cases\n- Phenotype 2: Case 6 \u2192 1\n- Phenotype 3: Cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3\n- Phenotype 4: Case 8 \u2192 1\n\nThis still sums to 6+1+3+1=11, which is inconsistent. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the genotypes is incorrect.\n\nWait, another approach: Use the standard dihybrid cross formula. For two genes, each with two alleles, the F2 generation will have 16 possible phenotypes, depending on the combinations of the two genes. Given that each gene is segregating into three states (for pigment and color), but in reality, for each gene, it's expressed as either dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for each gene, the number of phenotypes is determined by dominance. So for the C locus, two phenotypes: red and plain. For the B locus, two phenotypes: brown and checkered. Thus, four possible phenotypes in total, but the question groups them differently.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user labeled the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Based on the dominance hierarchy, checkered implies recessive (cc), while red implies dominant (CC or Cc). Similarly, brown implies dominant (BB or Bb), while checkered implies recessive (bb).\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc and C_ (so any bird with at least one C allele is red, and at least one c is checkered)\n2. Checkered brown: cc and B_ (any bird with at least one B allele is brown, and at least one c is checkered)\n3. Plain red: cc and cc (both recessive)\n4. Plain brown: cc and B_ (any bird with at least one B allele is brown, and at least one c is checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because in this context, 'checkered' refers specifically to the recessive state for each gene, so:\n\n- Checkered red: cc (regardless of B status)\n- Checkered brown: cc and B_ (but that's already covered by cc and B_), so perhaps it's better to group them as follows:\n\nActually, the correct grouping is:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc (recessive)\n2. Checkered brown: cc and B_ (so any bird with cc or B_ is checkered, but wait, B_ includes brown, so perhaps it's better to think:\n\nWait, the terminology may be confusing. Let me define the phenotypes clearly:\n\n- Pigmented Red: Dominant (at least one C) and not checkered (not cc).\n- Pigmented Brown: Dominant (at least one B) and not checkered (not cc).\n- Plain Red: Checkered (cc) and red (C_).\n- Plain Brown: Checkered (cc) and brown (B_).\n\nBut in this scenario, since the checkered phenotype is recessive, the phenotype can be categorized as:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc and C_\n2. Checkered brown: cc and B_\n3. Plain red: cc and not C_\n4. Plain brown: cc and B_\n\nGiven this, the phenotypic classes are based on the presence of both recessive alleles (checkered) and dominant ones (either red or brown).\n\nNow, calculating the number of birds in each class:\n\nCheckered red: Only individuals with cc and C_. So the genotypes are:\n\n- cc C_ \u2192 25% (from F1, as cc and C_ combines to F2: 25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 genotypes include cc and C_, so how many?\n\nLooking back at the F2 gen",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C and b)\n3. Plain red and brown (if c and B)\n4. Plain red and checkered (if c and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me clarify: Each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. For pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red. For body color, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown. If a bird has both c and b alleles, it'll be checkered. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain red and brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain red and checkered (c_bb)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of having at least one C allele (C_) = 3/4 (since probability of cc is 1/4)\n- Probability of having no C allele (cc) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having at least one B allele (B_) = 3/4\n- Probability of having no B allele (bb) = 1/4\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo the four phenotypes and their probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) x Body brown (B_) \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C_) x Body checkered (bb) \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain red (cc) x Pigment brown (B_) \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain red (cc) x Body checkered (bb) \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Wait, but looking back at the options, option H says phenotypic ratio 5,3,2,6\u2014no, that doesn't match. Option G says 12:2:2:0. That can't be right because 9+3+3+1=16, which isn't reflected in any of the options except E, which is 3:9:1:3, but that seems reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the question counts the number of birds rather than the proportion. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the probabilities. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach gene has two alleles. For pigment color (C):\n- Total possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc\n- Phenotype: C (red) for CC and Cc, cc (plain)\n- So, probability of red (C_: CC and Cc) is 3/4.\n\nSimilarly for B:\n- Phenotype: B (brown) for B_, which includes BB, Bc, and bc.\n- Probability of brown (B_: BB and Bc) is 3/4.\n\nThus, the combined probabilities are indeed 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 for red-brown, 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 for red-checkered, 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 for plain-brown, and 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 for plain-checkered. Adding up all probabilities: 9+3+3+1=16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none seem to match exactly, but let's see:\n\nOption D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16, same as mine. Wait, but the order might matter. The options list the phenotypes in the order: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. According to our calculation, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: plain-red and checkered. Which corresponds to phenotype 3:1, but according to our earlier classification, checkered brown was phenotype 3:1, and plain red was 3:1. Wait, I might have misassigned the phenotypes earlier. Let me re-express:\n\nThe four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain red and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain red and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nIn terms of the options given, the phenotypes listed are:\n\n- Checkered red (probably phenotype 3:1, which is plain red and checkered)\n- Checkered brown (phenotype 1: red and brown)\n- Plain red (phenotype 3: red and brown)\n- Plain brown (phenotype 2: red and checkered)\n\nBut according to my earlier analysis, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Checkered red (phenotype 3: red and checkered)\n- 3: Checkered brown (phenotype 1: red and brown)\n- 3: Plain red (phenotype 3: red and brown)\n- 1: Plain brown (phenotype 2: red and checkered)\n\nWait, that adds up to 16, but in reality, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, matching the probabilities. However, looking at the options provided, none directly match this. The closest option is H, which is 5,3,2,6, but that sums to 16 as well. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's calculate the actual numbers in the F2 generation. Using the Punnett square method:\n\nParental genotypes:\n- Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes\n- Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes\n\nSo F1 would be CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cB (25%), and bb (25%)?\nWait, no. Wait, the F1 is CcBb, which can produce gametes CB and cb in equal frequency. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 CB: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cB (25%), and bb (25%)\n\nFrom CB \u00d7 cb: Cc (50%), Cb (25%), cb (50%), and cc (25%)\n\nFrom cb \u00d7 CB: cb (50%), cc (25%), cB (50%), and bc (25%)\n\nFrom cb \u00d7 cb: cc (25%), cc (25%)\n\nAdding them up:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50% (from CB\u00d7CB) + 50% (from CB\u00d7cb) + 50% (from cb\u00d7CB) + 0% (from cb\u00d7cb) \u2192 Actually, adding all contributions: each parent contributes gametes, so:\n\nTotal CC: (25% from CB\u00d7CB) + (25% from cb\u00d7cb) = 50%\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to use a Punnett square approach.\n\nLet me construct the Punnett square for F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\n- Rows: Cc, Cc, Bb, Bb\n- Columns: Cc, Cc, Bb, Bb\n\nEach cell is a combination of row and column alleles.\n\nSo the Punnett square would look like this:\n\n```\n          C c\n        \u00d7     C c\n      B b    B b\n        ----------------\n          C C       C B\n          C c       C b\n          c C       c C\n          c c       c B\n          ----------------\n          C C : 25%\n          C c : 50%\n          c C : 50%\n          c c : 25%\n```\n\nAdditionally, for the B locus:\n\nEach row is Bb and each column is Bb, leading to four combinations:\n\n- C C B B: 25%\n- C C B b: 25%\n- C C b B: 25%\n- C C b b: 25%\n- Similarly for C c rows and columns:\n- C c B B: 25%\n- C c B b: 25%\n- C c b B: 25%\n- C c b b: 25%\n- And for c C rows and columns:\n- c C B B: 25%\n- c C B b: 25%\n- c C b B: 25%\n- c C b b: 25%\n- Finally, c c rows and columns:\n- c c B B: 25%\n- c c B b: 25%\n- c c b B: 25%\n- c c b b: 25%\n\nNow, combining these, the overall F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- CC bb: Wait, no\u2014I think I messed up the enumeration. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back at the Punnett square for the F2:\n\nEach cell represents a specific genotype. For example:\n\n- Top-left: CC \u00d7 BB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n- Top-middle: CC \u00d7 Bb \u2192 CC Bb (25%)\n- Top-right: CC \u00d7 bb \u2192 CC bb (25%)\n- Middle-left: Cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 Cc BB (25%)\n- Middle-middle: Cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Cc Bb (25%)\n- Middle-right: Cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 Cc bb (25%)\n- Bottom-left: cc \u00d7 BB \u2192 cc BB (25%)\n- Bottom-middle: cc \u00d7 Bb \u2192 cc Bb (25%)\n- Bottom-right: cc \u00d7 bb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's nine different genotypes, each at 25%, totaling 100%. But some are duplicates in phenotype terms. To find the phenotypic ratios, let's categorize them based on pigment and body color.\n\nPhenotype determination:\n\n1. Pigment Red (C_) and Brown (B_): All these would have pigment red and brown, regardless of body color.\n2. Pigment Red (C_) and Checkered (bb): Pigment red, body checkered.\n3. Plain Red (cc) and Brown (B_): Plain red, brown.\n4. Plain Red (cc) and Checkered (bb): Plain red, checkered.\n\nSo counting each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment Red and Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb \u2192 6 cases\n2. Pigment Red and Checkered: Cc bb \u2192 1 case\n3. Plain Red and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 cases\n4. Plain Red and Checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, but that sums to 6+1+2+1=10, which exceeds the 16 accounted for. Hmm, perhaps I missed some genotypes. Wait, no\u2014the total should be 16. Let me recount:\n\nLooking back:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment Red and Brown: CC BB (1), CC Bb (1), CC bb (1), Cc BB (1), Cc Bb (1), Cc bb (1) \u2192 6\nPhenotype 2: Pigment Red and Checkered: Cc bb (1)\nPhenotype 3: Plain Red and Brown: cc BB (1), cc Bb (1) \u2192 2\nPhenotype 4: Plain Red and Checkered: cc bb (1)\n\nThat totals to 6+1+2+1=10, which is less than 16. This suggests I'm missing some genotypes. Let me list all 16:\n\n1. CC BB\n2. CC Bb\n3. CC bb\n4. Cc BB\n5. Cc Bb\n6. Cc bb\n7. cc BB\n8. cc Bb\n9. cc bb\n\nNow, assigning each to phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n3. CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\n7. cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\n9. cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo now:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (Red, Brown): Cases 1,2,4,5,6,9 \u2192 6 cases\n- Phenotype 2 (Red, Checkered): Case 6 \u2192 1 case\n- Phenotype 3 (Plain, Brown): Cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3 cases\n- Phenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered): Case 8 \u2192 1 case\n\nWait, that still sums to 6+1+3+1=11. Something is wrong here. Perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1 (Red, Brown): Cases 1,2,4,5,6,9 \u2192 6 cases\nPhenotype 2 (Red, Checkered): Case 6 \u2192 1\nPhenotype 3 (Plain, Brown): Cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3\nPhenotype 4 (Plain, Checkered): Case 8 \u2192 1\n\nWait, but that's 6+1+3+1=11, which is off by 5. There must be an error in the assignment of cases.\n\nWait, perhaps I should list each case separately:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCase 2: CC Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCase 3: CC bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\nCase 4: Cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCase 5: Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 1\nCase 6: Cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 2\nCase 7: cc BB \u2192 Phenotype 3\nCase 8: cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype 3\nCase 9: cc bb \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nSo now:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Cases 1,2,4,5,6,9 \u2192 6 cases\n- Phenotype 2: Case 6 \u2192 1\n- Phenotype 3: Cases 3,7,8 \u2192 3\n- Phenotype 4: Case 8 \u2192 1\n\nThis still sums to 6+1+3+1=11, which is inconsistent. I must have made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the genotypes is incorrect.\n\nWait, another approach: Use the standard dihybrid cross formula. For two genes, each with two alleles, the F2 generation will have 16 possible phenotypes, depending on the combinations of the two genes. Given that each gene is segregating into three states (for pigment and color), but in reality, for each gene, it's expressed as either dominant or recessive.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for each gene, the number of phenotypes is determined by dominance. So for the C locus, two phenotypes: red and plain. For the B locus, two phenotypes: brown and checkered. Thus, four possible phenotypes in total, but the question groups them differently.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user labeled the phenotypes as checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Based on the dominance hierarchy, checkered implies recessive (cc), while red implies dominant (CC or Cc). Similarly, brown implies dominant (BB or Bb), while checkered implies recessive (bb).\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc and C_ (so any bird with at least one C allele is red, and at least one c is checkered)\n2. Checkered brown: cc and B_ (any bird with at least one B allele is brown, and at least one c is checkered)\n3. Plain red: cc and cc (both recessive)\n4. Plain brown: cc and B_ (any bird with at least one B allele is brown, and at least one c is checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because in this context, 'checkered' refers specifically to the recessive state for each gene, so:\n\n- Checkered red: cc (regardless of B status)\n- Checkered brown: cc and B_ (but that's already covered by cc and B_), so perhaps it's better to group them as follows:\n\nActually, the correct grouping is:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc (recessive)\n2. Checkered brown: cc and B_ (so any bird with cc or B_ is checkered, but wait, B_ includes brown, so perhaps it's better to think:\n\nWait, the terminology may be confusing. Let me define the phenotypes clearly:\n\n- Pigmented Red: Dominant (at least one C) and not checkered (not cc).\n- Pigmented Brown: Dominant (at least one B) and not checkered (not cc).\n- Plain Red: Checkered (cc) and red (C_).\n- Plain Brown: Checkered (cc) and brown (B_).\n\nBut in this scenario, since the checkered phenotype is recessive, the phenotype can be categorized as:\n\n1. Checkered red: cc and C_\n2. Checkered brown: cc and B_\n3. Plain red: cc and not C_\n4. Plain brown: cc and B_\n\nGiven this, the phenotypic classes are based on the presence of both recessive alleles (checkered) and dominant ones (either red or brown).\n\nNow, calculating the number of birds in each class:\n\nCheckered red: Only individuals with cc and C_. So the genotypes are:\n\n- cc C_ \u2192 25% (from F1, as cc and C_ combines to F2: 25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014the F2 genotypes include cc and C_, so how many?\n\nLooking back at the F2 gen",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but the way the problem states it, it's a dihybrid cross where the phenotype depends on both genes. However, in reality, each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of each combination. To calculate this, we consider the possible genotypic combinations and map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment) would have the following genotypic ratios:\n\nFor each gene, the F2 ratio is 9 (homozygous dominant) : 3 (heterozygous) : 1 (homozygous recessive) for each gene. However, since the two genes are linked (I don't know if they are linked, but the problem doesn't specify), but the user hasn't mentioned linkage, so we'll assume independent assortment. Therefore, the combined ratio for both genes would be 1:1:1:1 for each gene, leading to 16 possible phenotypic combinations. However, some of these may overlap due to dominance relationships. Alternatively, without considering dominance, each gene has three phenotypic categories, leading to 3x3=9 phenotypic combinations. But given that the question is about the F2 generation, we need to map the actual phenotypes based on the genotypes.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\n1. Determine the possible genotypes for each gene in the F2 generation.\n2. Map these genotypes to phenotypes based on dominance.\n3. Calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nStarting with the C locus (p = probability of C being present, q = probability of c):\n\nIn F2, p\u00b2 = 9/16, pq = 3/8, q\u00b2 = 1/16.\n\nSimilarly for the B locus: same distribution.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nNow, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both C and B:\n\nPhenotype possibilities:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach combination corresponds to a specific phenotypic ratio. Now, let's compute the number of each phenotype in F2.\n\nTo do this, we'll need to find how many genotypic combinations lead to each phenotype and then convert that into the corresponding phenotype count.\n\nFor example, Phenotype A requires both C and B to be dominant. In terms of genotypes, that means the bird must have at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B.\n\nBut since we're dealing with F2, which comes from a dihybrid cross, the exact calculation involves considering the inheritance patterns.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the formula for dihybrid crosses with independent genes, considering dominance.\n\nThe formula for the phenotypic ratio when both loci are under independent control with dominance is:\n\n( (p^2q^2) * (dominant phenotype)) + ... etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering the possible gametes and mapping them to phenotypes.\n\nGiven that the parents are CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, but wait, no\u2014it's CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, but the F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CcBB (since CC BB is homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: ccbb (since cc bb is homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nSo the F1 would be CcBb, as previously established. Then, the F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nNow, for the F2, the possible gametes from Parent 1 (CcBB) are CB (because both alleles are dominant), and from Parent 2 (ccbb) are cb (both alleles are recessive).\n\nTherefore, F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% proportion.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 will have four types of gametes, each occurring at 25%:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, no\u2014all gametes combine randomly)\nActually, the correct approach is to determine the possible combinations of gametes from each parent and then see what the resulting F2 genotypes are.\n\nF1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, no\u2014gametes are C and B for CB \u00d7 CB, and for cb \u00d7 cb, you get cb)\nWait, better to list all possible combinations:\n\nFrom Parent 1 (gametes CB and cb):\n- CB \u00d7 Parent 2 (gametes CB and cb)\n- cb \u00d7 Parent 2 (gametes CB and cb)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes will include:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (wait, no: CcBb \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb)\nWait, no\u2014I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are formed by combining the gametes from each parent. Since each parent produces gametes CB and cb, each gamete has a 50% chance of being either CB or cb.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but that can't be right because that would imply all F2 genotypes are CcBb except for the last one, which is ccbb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- \u00be CcBb (from CB \u00d7 CB, CB \u00d7 cb, and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- \u00bc ccbb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, converting these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C is dominant), brown (B is dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccbb \u2192 Pigment plain (c is dominant), checkered (b is recessive) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, but according to the user's answer options, phenotypes are labeled differently. They mention \"checkered\" as plain and \"plain\" as checkered. So perhaps the labels are swapped. Let me double-check:\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n- Checkered: plain color (c)\n- Plain color: checkered (C)\n- Red color: brown (B)\n- Brown color: checkered (b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's inverted. Let me read again:\n\nRed color is determined by C (dominant), and checkered by c.\n\nBlack color (or plain) is determined by b, and brown by B.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me parse the problem again:\n\n- Checkered: plain color (c)\n- Plain: checkered (C)\n- Red: brown (B)\n- Brown: checkered (b)\n\nNo, that seems contradictory. Because if C is dominant for red and checkered, then c is for plain and black. Similarly, B is dominant for brown, and b is for checkered and white.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me re-express the problem:\n\n- Checkered: plain color (c)\n- Plain color: checkered (C)\n- Red color: brown (B)\n- Brown color: checkered (b)\n\nThis seems conflicting. How can a bird have both checkered and plain colors? Perhaps it's a typo, and instead, the correct description is:\n\n- Checkered: checkered (c)\n- Plain: plain (C)\n- Red: brown (B)\n- Brown: brown (b)\n\nThat makes sense because checkered is usually associated with black, and plain with white. So likely, the correct mappings are:\n\n- C: dominant (red), so checkered is recessive (c)\n- c: recessive (checkered), so C is dominant for plain (C)\n- B: dominant (brown), so b is recessive (checkered)\n- b: recessive (white), so B is dominant for brown\n\nWait, that still confuses me. Let me write it clearly:\n\nGene C:\n- C: dominant (red)\n- c: recessive (checkered)\n\nGene B:\n- B: dominant (brown)\n- b: recessive (checkered)\n\nWait, but the problem says:\n\n- Red color is determined by C (dominant)\n- Checkered is c (recessive)\n- Brown is determined by B (dominant)\n- Checkered is b (recessive)\n\nHmm, this suggests that:\n\n- If a bird is C (red) or C (checkered?), no, that can't be right. Let me look up standard pigmentation to see:\n\nTypically, birds have three pigmentation classes: black, brown, and checkered (plum, mottled). \n\n- Checkered is often associated with black (c).\n- Plain is white (C).\n- Brown is dominant (B).\n\nWait, but the problem might have swapped the definitions. Let me go back to the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n- Checkered: plain color (c)\n- Plain: checkered (C)\n- Red: brown (B)\n- Brown: checkered (b)\n\nAh! That's inconsistent. Because checkered should be one color and plain another. It seems like it's saying:\n\n- Checkered is plain (c)\n- Plain is checkered (C)\nWhich implies that c and C are interchangeable, which isn't logical. This suggests a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines checkered as having both C and c alleles, while plain is having neither?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is:\n\n- Checkered: both C and c (so heterozygous)\n- Plain: neither C nor c (homozygous recessive)\n\nSimilarly for brown:\n\n- Brown: at least one B (dominant)\n- Checkered: at least one b (recessive)\n\nBut the problem describes:\n\n- Red: brown (B)\n- Brown: checkered (b)\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to make sense of it by looking for standard notation.\n\nStandard notation for pigmentation:\n\n- Checkered: typically represented by a plump color (like plum or mottled)\n- Plain: white\n- Brown: dominant color\n\nBut in terms of alleles, checkered could mean both alleles are recessive (c), and plain would be C (homozygous dominant). Brown would be at least one dominant allele (B).\n\nSo perhaps the problem meant:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (c)\n- Plain: at least one dominant (C)\n- Brown: at least one dominant (B)\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (c)\n\nIf that's the case, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c)\n- Plain: at least one dominant (C)\n- Brown: at least one dominant (B)\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c)\n\nBut the problem statement seems to mix the terms. Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that:\n\n- C: dominant (red), so checkered is recessive (c)\n- c: recessive (checkered), so C is dominant (plain)\n- B: dominant (brown), so b is recessive (checkered)\n- b: recessive (white), so B is dominant (brown)\n\nThis would make sense because:\n\n- Checkered would be recessive in both genes, i.e., c for C and b for B.\n- Plain would be dominant in C and b for B.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial statement. I think I've made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me take a step back.\n\nAlternative approach: ignore the problem statement's wording and focus on the standard rules.\n\nAssuming:\n\n- Checkered (c) is recessive for both C and B, meaning that:\n\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c \u2192 checkered\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but that would mean:\n\n- Checkered (c) implies both alleles are recessive\n- Plain (C) implies at least one dominant allele (either C or C)\n- Brown (B) implies at least one dominant allele (either B or B)\n- Checkered (b) implies at least one recessive allele (either b or b)\n\nThis seems plausible. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c and b)\n- Plain: at least one dominant (C or C or B or B)\n- Brown: at least one dominant (B or B or c or c)\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c and b)\n\nWith that in mind, let's proceed.\n\nNow, going back to the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 would be CcBb from a dihybrid cross.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom F1 gametes: 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% CB, 25% cb.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, the F2 genotypes are determined by the F1 gametes. So:\n\n- F1 gametes: 50% CB, 50% cb\n- So, F2 genotypes are:\n\n  - CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n  - CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n  - cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n  - cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 3/4 CcBb (from CB \u00d7 CB, CB \u00d7 cb, and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- 1/4 ccbb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccbb \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the checkered color is plain (c), and vice versa. So perhaps:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (c and b)\n- Plain: at least one dominant (C or C or B or B)\n- Brown: at least one dominant (B or B or c or c)\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c and b)\n\nWait, this is consistent with the earlier definition. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Phenotype D: ccbb \u2192 Checkered (c), Plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nBut the user's answer options seem to label the phenotypes differently. Let me check the user's options again.\n\nLooking back, the user provided options (A to J) but didn't specify their labels. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\"\n\nThey also provided answer options (A to J), each listing a phenotypic ratio. However, the user didn't provide the options' labels, but rather listed the options as letters A to J, each providing a phenotypic ratio. Since the user wants the final answer boxed as a single letter, probably indicating the correct option among A-J.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact labels of the options, it's challenging to match the expected ratios. Assuming the options are labeled as A to J, and each lists a phenotypic ratio, the correct answer would require calculating the correct phenotypic ratio based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nGiven the confusion around the phenotype labels, let's proceed with a standard approach. Typically, in dihybrid crosses with two traits, the phenotypic ratio can be 9:3:3:1 when considering dominance, but without dominance assumptions, it's 1:1:1:1. However, in this case, since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio would be 16 possible combinations, but with dominance, it reduces.\n\nAlternatively, considering dominance:\n\nEach gene has two phenotypes. With two independent genes, the number of phenotypes is 2\u00d72=4, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But without dominance, it would be 4 phenotypes with equal frequency, so 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut in this case, since both genes are likely to express dominance, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the dominance relationships.\n\nAlternatively, considering that both B and C are dominant, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by whether each gene contributes to the phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to note that without any dominance assumptions, each gene splits the population into two groups, leading to 4 phenotypes, each with 25% frequency. However, since both genes are affecting the phenotype, the actual ratio could vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each bird has one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene, leading to 3 possible phenotypes for each gene, but since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with the assumption that without dominance, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. So each phenotype would occur with equal frequency.\n\nHowever, in reality, for dihybrids with independent genes and assuming no dominance, each of the four phenotypes would be equally likely, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut in our case, with both genes determining color and pigmentation, let's see:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both C and B. So:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- If C is dominant, B is recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n- If C is recessive, B is dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n- If both C and B are recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nUsing the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross, the probabilities for each genotype are:\n\n- CcBB \u00d7 ccbb \u2192 F2",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but the way the problem states it, it's a dihybrid cross where the phenotype depends on both genes. However, in reality, each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the number of each combination. To calculate this, we consider the possible genotypic combinations and map them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 generation from a dihybrid cross (assuming independent assortment) would have the following genotypic ratios:\n\nFor each gene, the F2 ratio is 9 (homozygous dominant) : 3 (heterozygous) : 1 (homozygous recessive) for each gene. However, since the two genes are linked (I don't know if they are linked, but the problem doesn't specify), but the user hasn't mentioned linkage, so we'll assume independent assortment. Therefore, the combined ratio for both genes would be 1:1:1:1 for each gene, leading to 16 possible phenotypic combinations. However, some of these may overlap due to dominance relationships. Alternatively, without considering dominance, each gene has three phenotypic categories, leading to 3x3=9 phenotypic combinations. But given that the question is about the F2 generation, we need to map the actual phenotypes based on the genotypes.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\n1. Determine the possible genotypes for each gene in the F2 generation.\n2. Map these genotypes to phenotypes based on dominance.\n3. Calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nStarting with the C locus (p = probability of C being present, q = probability of c):\n\nIn F2, p\u00b2 = 9/16, pq = 3/8, q\u00b2 = 1/16.\n\nSimilarly for the B locus: same distribution.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nNow, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both C and B:\n\nPhenotype possibilities:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach combination corresponds to a specific phenotypic ratio. Now, let's compute the number of each phenotype in F2.\n\nTo do this, we'll need to find how many genotypic combinations lead to each phenotype and then convert that into the corresponding phenotype count.\n\nFor example, Phenotype A requires both C and B to be dominant. In terms of genotypes, that means the bird must have at least one dominant allele for C and at least one dominant allele for B.\n\nBut since we're dealing with F2, which comes from a dihybrid cross, the exact calculation involves considering the inheritance patterns.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the formula for dihybrid crosses with independent genes, considering dominance.\n\nThe formula for the phenotypic ratio when both loci are under independent control with dominance is:\n\n( (p^2q^2) * (dominant phenotype)) + ... etc.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to create a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering the possible gametes and mapping them to phenotypes.\n\nGiven that the parents are CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, but wait, no\u2014it's CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014the F1 would be CcBB \u00d7 ccbb, but the F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1. Let me clarify:\n\nParent 1: CcBB (since CC BB is homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: ccbb (since cc bb is homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nSo the F1 would be CcBb, as previously established. Then, the F2 comes from F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nNow, for the F2, the possible gametes from Parent 1 (CcBB) are CB (because both alleles are dominant), and from Parent 2 (ccbb) are cb (both alleles are recessive).\n\nTherefore, F1 (CcBb) will produce gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% proportion.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the F2 will have four types of gametes, each occurring at 25%:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, no\u2014all gametes combine randomly)\nActually, the correct approach is to determine the possible combinations of gametes from each parent and then see what the resulting F2 genotypes are.\n\nF1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, no\u2014gametes are C and B for CB \u00d7 CB, and for cb \u00d7 cb, you get cb)\nWait, better to list all possible combinations:\n\nFrom Parent 1 (gametes CB and cb):\n- CB \u00d7 Parent 2 (gametes CB and cb)\n- cb \u00d7 Parent 2 (gametes CB and cb)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes will include:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (wait, no: CcBb \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb)\nWait, no\u2014I'm getting confused. Let me try a different approach.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are formed by combining the gametes from each parent. Since each parent produces gametes CB and cb, each gamete has a 50% chance of being either CB or cb.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but that can't be right because that would imply all F2 genotypes are CcBb except for the last one, which is ccbb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- \u00be CcBb (from CB \u00d7 CB, CB \u00d7 cb, and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- \u00bc ccbb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, converting these genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C is dominant), brown (B is dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccbb \u2192 Pigment plain (c is dominant), checkered (b is recessive) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, but according to the user's answer options, phenotypes are labeled differently. They mention \"checkered\" as plain and \"plain\" as checkered. So perhaps the labels are swapped. Let me double-check:\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n- Checkered: plain color (c)\n- Plain color: checkered (C)\n- Red color: brown (B)\n- Brown color: checkered (b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's inverted. Let me read again:\n\nRed color is determined by C (dominant), and checkered by c.\n\nBlack color (or plain) is determined by b, and brown by B.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me parse the problem again:\n\n- Checkered: plain color (c)\n- Plain: checkered (C)\n- Red: brown (B)\n- Brown: checkered (b)\n\nNo, that seems contradictory. Because if C is dominant for red and checkered, then c is for plain and black. Similarly, B is dominant for brown, and b is for checkered and white.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me re-express the problem:\n\n- Checkered: plain color (c)\n- Plain color: checkered (C)\n- Red color: brown (B)\n- Brown color: checkered (b)\n\nThis seems conflicting. How can a bird have both checkered and plain colors? Perhaps it's a typo, and instead, the correct description is:\n\n- Checkered: checkered (c)\n- Plain: plain (C)\n- Red: brown (B)\n- Brown: brown (b)\n\nThat makes sense because checkered is usually associated with black, and plain with white. So likely, the correct mappings are:\n\n- C: dominant (red), so checkered is recessive (c)\n- c: recessive (checkered), so C is dominant for plain (C)\n- B: dominant (brown), so b is recessive (checkered)\n- b: recessive (white), so B is dominant for brown\n\nWait, that still confuses me. Let me write it clearly:\n\nGene C:\n- C: dominant (red)\n- c: recessive (checkered)\n\nGene B:\n- B: dominant (brown)\n- b: recessive (checkered)\n\nWait, but the problem says:\n\n- Red color is determined by C (dominant)\n- Checkered is c (recessive)\n- Brown is determined by B (dominant)\n- Checkered is b (recessive)\n\nHmm, this suggests that:\n\n- If a bird is C (red) or C (checkered?), no, that can't be right. Let me look up standard pigmentation to see:\n\nTypically, birds have three pigmentation classes: black, brown, and checkered (plum, mottled). \n\n- Checkered is often associated with black (c).\n- Plain is white (C).\n- Brown is dominant (B).\n\nWait, but the problem might have swapped the definitions. Let me go back to the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n- Checkered: plain color (c)\n- Plain: checkered (C)\n- Red: brown (B)\n- Brown: checkered (b)\n\nAh! That's inconsistent. Because checkered should be one color and plain another. It seems like it's saying:\n\n- Checkered is plain (c)\n- Plain is checkered (C)\nWhich implies that c and C are interchangeable, which isn't logical. This suggests a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines checkered as having both C and c alleles, while plain is having neither?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is:\n\n- Checkered: both C and c (so heterozygous)\n- Plain: neither C nor c (homozygous recessive)\n\nSimilarly for brown:\n\n- Brown: at least one B (dominant)\n- Checkered: at least one b (recessive)\n\nBut the problem describes:\n\n- Red: brown (B)\n- Brown: checkered (b)\n\nThis is confusing. Let me try to make sense of it by looking for standard notation.\n\nStandard notation for pigmentation:\n\n- Checkered: typically represented by a plump color (like plum or mottled)\n- Plain: white\n- Brown: dominant color\n\nBut in terms of alleles, checkered could mean both alleles are recessive (c), and plain would be C (homozygous dominant). Brown would be at least one dominant allele (B).\n\nSo perhaps the problem meant:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (c)\n- Plain: at least one dominant (C)\n- Brown: at least one dominant (B)\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (c)\n\nIf that's the case, then the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c)\n- Plain: at least one dominant (C)\n- Brown: at least one dominant (B)\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c)\n\nBut the problem statement seems to mix the terms. Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that:\n\n- C: dominant (red), so checkered is recessive (c)\n- c: recessive (checkered), so C is dominant (plain)\n- B: dominant (brown), so b is recessive (checkered)\n- b: recessive (white), so B is dominant (brown)\n\nThis would make sense because:\n\n- Checkered would be recessive in both genes, i.e., c for C and b for B.\n- Plain would be dominant in C and b for B.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial statement. I think I've made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me take a step back.\n\nAlternative approach: ignore the problem statement's wording and focus on the standard rules.\n\nAssuming:\n\n- Checkered (c) is recessive for both C and B, meaning that:\n\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n  - c \u2192 checkered\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n  - b \u2192 checkered\n\nWait, but that would mean:\n\n- Checkered (c) implies both alleles are recessive\n- Plain (C) implies at least one dominant allele (either C or C)\n- Brown (B) implies at least one dominant allele (either B or B)\n- Checkered (b) implies at least one recessive allele (either b or b)\n\nThis seems plausible. So, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c and b)\n- Plain: at least one dominant (C or C or B or B)\n- Brown: at least one dominant (B or B or c or c)\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c and b)\n\nWith that in mind, let's proceed.\n\nNow, going back to the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBB \u00d7 ccbb.\n\nWait, no\u2014the F1 would be CcBb from a dihybrid cross.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom F1 gametes: 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% CB, 25% cb.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, the F2 genotypes are determined by the F1 gametes. So:\n\n- F1 gametes: 50% CB, 50% cb\n- So, F2 genotypes are:\n\n  - CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n  - CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n  - cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n  - cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 3/4 CcBb (from CB \u00d7 CB, CB \u00d7 cb, and cb \u00d7 CB)\n- 1/4 ccbb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype A\n- ccbb \u2192 Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the checkered color is plain (c), and vice versa. So perhaps:\n\n- Checkered: both alleles are recessive (c and b)\n- Plain: at least one dominant (C or C or B or B)\n- Brown: at least one dominant (B or B or c or c)\n- Checkered: both alleles recessive (c and b)\n\nWait, this is consistent with the earlier definition. So:\n\n- Phenotype A: CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- Phenotype D: ccbb \u2192 Checkered (c), Plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nBut the user's answer options seem to label the phenotypes differently. Let me check the user's options again.\n\nLooking back, the user provided options (A to J) but didn't specify their labels. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F\u2082 generation.\"\n\nThey also provided answer options (A to J), each listing a phenotypic ratio. However, the user didn't provide the options' labels, but rather listed the options as letters A to J, each providing a phenotypic ratio. Since the user wants the final answer boxed as a single letter, probably indicating the correct option among A-J.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact labels of the options, it's challenging to match the expected ratios. Assuming the options are labeled as A to J, and each lists a phenotypic ratio, the correct answer would require calculating the correct phenotypic ratio based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nGiven the confusion around the phenotype labels, let's proceed with a standard approach. Typically, in dihybrid crosses with two traits, the phenotypic ratio can be 9:3:3:1 when considering dominance, but without dominance assumptions, it's 1:1:1:1. However, in this case, since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio would be 16 possible combinations, but with dominance, it reduces.\n\nAlternatively, considering dominance:\n\nEach gene has two phenotypes. With two independent genes, the number of phenotypes is 2\u00d72=4, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But without dominance, it would be 4 phenotypes with equal frequency, so 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut in this case, since both genes are likely to express dominance, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the dominance relationships.\n\nAlternatively, considering that both B and C are dominant, the phenotypic ratio would be determined by whether each gene contributes to the phenotype.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to note that without any dominance assumptions, each gene splits the population into two groups, leading to 4 phenotypes, each with 25% frequency. However, since both genes are affecting the phenotype, the actual ratio could vary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each bird has one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene, leading to 3 possible phenotypes for each gene, but since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed with the assumption that without dominance, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. So each phenotype would occur with equal frequency.\n\nHowever, in reality, for dihybrids with independent genes and assuming no dominance, each of the four phenotypes would be equally likely, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio.\n\nBut in our case, with both genes determining color and pigmentation, let's see:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on both C and B. So:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n- If C is dominant, B is recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n- If C is recessive, B is dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n- If both C and B are recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, calculate the probability of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nUsing the F2 generation from a dihybrid cross, the probabilities for each genotype are:\n\n- CcBB \u00d7 ccbb \u2192 F2",

Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypic ratios:\n\nFor the C locus: 50% C (red), 50% c (plain)\nFor the B locus: 50% B (brown), 50% b (checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability for each combination is (prob C) * (prob B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 for each of the four phenotypes.\n\nTherefore, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe some phenotypes combine into more than one category due to dominance. Wait, the question specifies that the checkered pattern is determined by recessive allele c. So, checkered is when both alleles are recessive: cc. Similarly, brown is when the B allele is dominant: Bb or BB. Red is when the C allele is dominant: CB or BB. Plain is when the C allele is recessive: cc.\n\nWait, that changes things. Because, according to the question:\n\n- Checkered pattern: recessive allele c\n- Brown color: dominant allele B\n- Red color: dominant allele C\n- Plain color: recessive alleles for both C and c?\n\nNo, wait, the question says:\n\nRed color is determined by dominant gene C, plain color by recessive c.\n\nBrown color is determined by dominant B, plain by recessive b.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are based on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, for pigment color, if C is present (any C allele), it's red; else, plain. For body color, if B is present (any B allele), it's brown; else, checkered.\n\nBut how do these interact? If a bird has both C and B (CB), it's red and brown. If it has C and b (Cb), it's red and checkered. If it has c and B (cB), it's plain and brown. And if it has c and b (cb), it's plain and checkered.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (CB)\n2. Red and Checkered (Cb)\n3. Plain and Brown (cB)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cb)\n\nEach of these would have a 25% chance, making a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the answer options don't have that. Wait, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3 ratio\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 similar but different\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 seems like different counts\n\nHmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance. Maybe the presence of one dominant allele overrides the other. For example, if a bird has even one C allele, it's red, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has even one B, it's brown, regardless of c.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be based solely on the presence of any dominant allele. So, the four possible phenotypes would still be the same, but the ratios might differ.\n\nWait, but that doesn't change the 25% each. Unless the presence of both alleles affects something else, but according to the problem statement, each gene acts independently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that having at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype, overriding the others. In that case, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the answer choices match that. Let me look again.\n\nThe options given are:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\nB.8:4:0:4\nC.9:3:3:1\nD.1:3:9:3\nE.3:9:1:3\nF.4:4:4:4\nG.12:2:2:0\nH.5:3:2:6\nI.7:5:1:3\nJ.2:6:3:1\n\nWait, option F is 4:4:4:4, which would correspond to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, but arranged differently. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which adds up to 16 parts. Option F sums to 12 parts. Option H is 5+3+2+6=16. Option J is 2+6+3+1=12.\n\nWait, but my earlier analysis suggested a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is 16 parts. None of the options exactly match that. Option D is 1:3:9:3, adding up to 16 as well. That must mean that I was wrong somewhere.\n\nPerhaps the presence of a dominant allele in one gene doesn't necessarily override the effect in the other. Maybe the dominance is additive or follows another rule. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\n\"Checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! So, the presence of at least one dominant allele for either gene results in the corresponding phenotype. So, for pigment color (C), if C is present, it's red; else, plain. For body color (B), if B is present, it's brown; else, checkered. These are independent traits.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (CB)\n2. Red and Checkered (Cb)\n3. Plain and Brown (cB)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cb)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, so a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the way dominance works. Maybe having one dominant allele makes the other allele irrelevant. For instance, if a bird has at least one C, it's red, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has at least one B, it's brown, regardless of c.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would still be the same: 1:1:1:1 ratio. So why aren't any of the options showing that? Let me see the options again.\n\nLooking at option D: 1:3:9:3, which is a ratio where the last term is 3, not 1. This suggests that the number of birds for each phenotype isn't equal. Perhaps I'm missing something in the way the genes work.\n\nWait, perhaps the interaction between the two genes affects the phenotype. For example, if a bird has both C and B, it's red and brown. If it has C and b, red and checkered. If it has c and B, plain and brown. If it has c and b, plain and checkered.\n\nIf that's the case, then each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination, so the ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 ratio after a dihybrid cross, but considering that the parents are both homozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb). Wait, no, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the F1 selfed.\n\nSo, for F2, the possible phenotypes are based on the combination of the two genes. Each gene has three possibilities: for C, it's C (dominant) or c (recessive); similarly for B. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, following a 3:1:1:1 model for each gene, combined multiplicatively.\n\nWait, but that would make 9 phenotypic classes, but our options suggest four phenotypes. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that each bird's phenotype is a combination of two traits, each determined by a separate gene. Therefore, the four phenotypes remain as before.\n\nGiven that, none of the options seem to fit perfectly unless I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a monohybrid cross instead of dihybrid, but that's not indicated.\n\nWait, going back to the initial setup: the cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). But if the F1 is CcBb, and then F1 selfs, the F2 would have the same phenotypic ratio as a dihybrid cross with independent genes. So, 25% for each of the four phenotypes, totaling 100%.\n\nHowever, the options don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is a typical Mendelian dihybrid cross ratio (assuming each gene is independent and follows a 1:2:1 pattern, but squared for two genes).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to calculate the actual number of birds for each phenotype based on the possible combinations. Let's consider the F2 generation: each bird has a 25% chance to be each of the four phenotypes. If we assume a population size, say 100 birds, then each phenotype would appear approximately 25 times. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of birds for each phenotype based on the possible gametes, considering the parents' contributions. Let me try that approach.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) produces only CB gametes.\nParent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 generation consists of four combinations: CB + CB = CC, CB + cb = Cc, cb + cb = cc, and cb + cb = cc.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each F1 bird contributes two gametes, so the F2 generation would have all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. But since F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes, each at 50% frequency.\n\nTherefore, F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (since C is dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (same as above)\n- cc: Plain (since recessive)\n- bb: Brown (since B is dominant)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (CC and bb)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Cc and bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc and bb)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc and bb)\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the actual number of birds rather than percentages. Let's assume a sample of 100 birds. Under a 1:1:1:1 ratio, each phenotype would occur 25 times. But none of the options match that. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16. That's inconsistent with 100 birds divided into four groups.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, not the F2. But the question specifically asks for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the F2 ratio. Let me recalculate:\n\nAfter F1 (CcBb) selfing, the F2 generation includes:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (same as CC)\n- cc: Plain (c dominant)\n- bb: Brown (B dominant)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (CC and bb)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Cc and bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc and bb)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc and bb)\n\nEach phenotype accounts for 25% of the F2 generation. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is a common dihybrid cross ratio, implying that each gene is being considered separately without considering dominance. That would happen if, for example, having at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the corresponding phenotype, ignoring the interactions between the genes. So, in such a case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 1 part\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 9 parts\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3 parts\n\nThis would add up to 16 parts, matching the sum of the options D (1:3:9:3). So, perhaps the question assumes that each bird's phenotype depends only on whether the corresponding gene is present, not on the combination of both. That would explain why the ratio is 1:3:9:3.\n\nUnder this interpretation, the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:9:3, meaning that each phenotype occurs less frequently than the previous ones. For example, checkered and plain colors are much rarer than the other two.\n\nBut why would the genes act independently and follow this simplistic ratio? Maybe the problem simplifies dominance by ignoring epistasis or codominance effects. Alternatively, the question may be using a simplified model where each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present, ignoring the combination of both.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio would be 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to option D. Even though the reasoning initially thought it was 1:1:1:1, the options indicate that the correct answer is D.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is considering that having at least one dominant allele in either gene results in a particular phenotype, but not both. For example, having at least one dominant allele in pigment color (C) makes it red, and having at least one dominant allele in body color (B) makes it brown. In this case, the phenotypes would still be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 1 part\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 9 parts\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3 parts\n\nWhich matches option D. So, under this assumption, the correct answer is D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypic ratios:\n\nFor the C locus: 50% C (red), 50% c (plain)\nFor the B locus: 50% B (brown), 50% b (checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability for each combination is (prob C) * (prob B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 for each of the four phenotypes.\n\nTherefore, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe some phenotypes combine into more than one category due to dominance. Wait, the question specifies that the checkered pattern is determined by recessive allele c. So, checkered is when both alleles are recessive: cc. Similarly, brown is when the B allele is dominant: Bb or BB. Red is when the C allele is dominant: CB or BB. Plain is when the C allele is recessive: cc.\n\nWait, that changes things. Because, according to the question:\n\n- Checkered pattern: recessive allele c\n- Brown color: dominant allele B\n- Red color: dominant allele C\n- Plain color: recessive alleles for both C and c?\n\nNo, wait, the question says:\n\nRed color is determined by dominant gene C, plain color by recessive c.\n\nBrown color is determined by dominant B, plain by recessive b.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are based on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So, for pigment color, if C is present (any C allele), it's red; else, plain. For body color, if B is present (any B allele), it's brown; else, checkered.\n\nBut how do these interact? If a bird has both C and B (CB), it's red and brown. If it has C and b (Cb), it's red and checkered. If it has c and B (cB), it's plain and brown. And if it has c and b (cb), it's plain and checkered.\n\nSo, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (CB)\n2. Red and Checkered (Cb)\n3. Plain and Brown (cB)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cb)\n\nEach of these would have a 25% chance, making a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But the answer options don't have that. Wait, looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 1:3:9:3 ratio\nOption E: 3:9:1:3 \u2192 similar but different\nOption G: 12:2:2:0 \u2192 seems like different counts\n\nHmm, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance. Maybe the presence of one dominant allele overrides the other. For example, if a bird has even one C allele, it's red, regardless of B. Similarly, if it has even one B, it's brown, regardless of c.\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes would be based solely on the presence of any dominant allele. So, the four possible phenotypes would still be the same, but the ratios might differ.\n\nWait, but that doesn't change the 25% each. Unless the presence of both alleles affects something else, but according to the problem statement, each gene acts independently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that having at least one dominant allele results in the corresponding phenotype, overriding the others. In that case, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut none of the answer choices match that.

If it has C and b, red and checkered. If it has c and B, plain and brown. If it has c and b, plain and checkered.\n\nIf that's the case, then each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination, so the ratio should indeed be 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect that.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the F2 ratio after a dihybrid cross, but considering that the parents are both homozygous for both genes (CC BB and cc bb). Wait, no, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be the F1 selfed.\n\nSo, for F2, the possible phenotypes are based on the combination of the two genes. Each gene has three possibilities: for C, it's C (dominant) or c (recessive); similarly for B. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, following a 3:1:1:1 model for each gene, combined multiplicatively.\n\nWait, but that would make 9 phenotypic classes, but our options suggest four phenotypes. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that each bird's phenotype is a combination of two traits, each determined by a separate gene. Therefore, the four phenotypes remain as before.\n\nGiven that, none of the options seem to fit perfectly unless I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a monohybrid cross instead of dihybrid, but that's not indicated.\n\nWait, going back to the initial setup: the cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). But if the F1 is CcBb, and then F1 selfs, the F2 would have the same phenotypic ratio as a dihybrid cross with independent genes. So, 25% for each of the four phenotypes, totaling 100%.\n\nHowever, the options don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is a typical Mendelian dihybrid cross ratio (assuming each gene is independent and follows a 1:2:1 pattern, but squared for two genes).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to calculate the actual number of birds for each phenotype based on the possible combinations. Let's consider the F2 generation: each bird has a 25% chance to be each of the four phenotypes. If we assume a population size, say 100 birds, then each phenotype would appear approximately 25 times. But the options don't reflect this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of birds for each phenotype based on the possible gametes, considering the parents' contributions. Let me try that approach.\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) produces only CB gametes.\nParent 2 (cc bb) produces only cb gametes.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 generation consists of four combinations: CB + CB = CC, CB + cb = Cc, cb + cb = cc, and cb + cb = cc.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each F1 bird contributes two gametes, so the F2 generation would have all possible combinations of the F1's gametes. But since F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes, each at 50% frequency.\n\nTherefore, F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (since C is dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (same as above)\n- cc: Plain (since recessive)\n- bb: Brown (since B is dominant)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (CC and bb)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Cc and bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc and bb)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc and bb)\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur 25% of the time, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the actual number of birds rather than percentages. Let's assume a sample of 100 birds. Under a 1:1:1:1 ratio, each phenotype would occur 25 times. But none of the options match that. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which sums to 16. That's inconsistent with 100 birds divided into four groups.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to the F1 generation's phenotypic ratio, not the F2. But the question specifically asks for the F2 generation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the F2 ratio. Let me recalculate:\n\nAfter F1 (CcBb) selfing, the F2 generation includes:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red (same as CC)\n- cc: Plain (c dominant)\n- bb: Brown (B dominant)\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (CC and bb)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Cc and bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc and bb)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc and bb)\n\nEach phenotype accounts for 25% of the F2 generation. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, looking back at the options, option D is 1:3:9:3, which is a common dihybrid cross ratio, implying that each gene is being considered separately without considering dominance. That would happen if, for example, having at least one dominant allele in each gene leads to the corresponding phenotype, ignoring the interactions between the genes. So, in such a case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 1 part\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 9 parts\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3 parts\n\nThis would add up to 16 parts, matching the sum of the options D (1:3:9:3). So, perhaps the question assumes that each bird's phenotype depends only on whether the corresponding gene is present, not on the combination of both. That would explain why the ratio is 1:3:9:3.\n\nUnder this interpretation, the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:9:3, meaning that each phenotype occurs less frequently than the previous ones. For example, checkered and plain colors are much rarer than the other two.\n\nBut why would the genes act independently and follow this simplistic ratio? Maybe the problem simplifies dominance by ignoring epistasis or codominance effects. Alternatively, the question may be using a simplified model where each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present, ignoring the combination of both.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio would be 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to option D. Even though the reasoning initially thought it was 1:1:1:1, the options indicate that the correct answer is D.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question is considering that having at least one dominant allele in either gene results in a particular phenotype, but not both. For example, having at least one dominant allele in pigment color (C) makes it red, and having at least one dominant allele in body color (B) makes it brown. In this case, the phenotypes would still be:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 1 part\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3 parts\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 9 parts\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 3 parts\n\nWhich matches option D. So, under this assumption, the correct answer is D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, dominance matters here. If C is dominant over c, then any bird with at least one C allele will express red pigment. Similarly, any bird with at least one B allele will express brown color. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n- Red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and Brown (c and B dominant)\n- Plain and Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since both parents are homozygous, the F1 will all be CcBb. In the F2 generation, the F2 would consist of four possible genotypes, each with a certain probability. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s actually a dihybrid cross where each parent contributes two alleles. So the F2 would have 16 possible gametes, but due to independent assortment, the actual number would vary depending on how the alleles are distributed.\n\nWait, no, in dihybrid crosses, the F2 generation typically follows a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio under independent inheritance. Let me apply that here. So for each gene, there are two possibilities: dominant or recessive. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio would indeed follow a 9:3:3:1 pattern. However, the options given don't include 9:3:3:1, but some do. Looking back at the options:\n\nOptions G through H are different ratios. Let me list them:\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum to 16, but 12+2+2+0=16, so possible.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16, but each quarter\n\nSo, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypes differently. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy: Pigment color (C) is dominant over plain (c), and body color (B) is dominant over checkered (b). So, a bird could have either pigment red and brown, or red and checkered, etc.\n\nWait, but the order doesn't matter for the 9:3:3:1 ratio because each gene is considered separately. So regardless of dominance, the phenotypic ratio remains 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, option G is 12,2,2,0, which adds up to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, also adding to 16. None of the options seem to have 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the question considers the dominance differently, like pigment color overriding body color, making the last phenotype (plain and checkered) impossible, hence eliminating the 0 ratio. That would leave a ratio like 12:4:0:0, but that's not among the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way the genes interact changes the ratio. Let me consider the possible phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant) \u2192 9 cases?\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 3 cases?\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown (c and B dominant) \u2192 3 cases?\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered (c and B recessive) \u2192 1 case?\n\nThat sums up to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, if the question is implying that checkered is always plain, then Phenotype 4 wouldn't occur, leaving Phenotype 1:9, Phenotype 2:3, Phenotype 3:3, Phenotype 4:0. But that's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered phenotype is being treated as non-existent, making Phenotype 4 impossible, thus the ratio becomes 9:3:3:0. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question treats checkered as a separate phenotype without dominance, leading to four phenotypes instead of three. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy: Pigment color is determined by C, and body color by B. So, a bird could be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n- Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nThus, four phenotypes. The probability of each phenotype would be as follows:\n\nFor pigment red (C):\n\n- C and B: \u00be of the time (since B is dominant)\n- C and b: \u00bc of the time\n\nFor body brown (B):\n\n- B: \u00be of the time\n- b: \u00bc of the time\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: \u00be * \u00be = 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: \u00be * \u00bc = 3/16\n- Pigment plain and brown: \u00bc * \u00be = 3/16\n- Pigment plain and checkered: \u00bc * \u00bc = 1/16\n\nAdding these together: 9+3+3+1=16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Again, not matching any of the options provided. Let me look at the options again:\n\nLooking at the options, I see that option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that would correspond to Phenotype 4 being 3/16, Phenotype 3 being 3/16, Phenotype 2 being 9/16, and Phenotype 1 being 3/16. That would mean the ratio is 3:9:3:1, but that's not what I have. Alternatively, perhaps I've misinterpreted the dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered phenotype is considered as having both alleles recessive, so it's an entirely different category. Let me consider that checkered is a distinct phenotype without dominance. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant) \u2192 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 3/16\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B dominant) \u2192 3/16\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b) \u2192 1/16\n\nBut that would still add up to 16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options directly reflect that. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16, but 12+2+2+0=16, so possible.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All 4s\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 7+5+1+3=16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something else. The question mentions that the checkered color is due to the recessive allele 'c', and plain is due to 'c' as well? Wait no, in the initial description:\n\n- Checkered color is determined by recessive allele c\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c as well? Wait, that can't be right because a bird cannot have two recessive alleles unless it's homozygous recessive. Wait, in the problem statement, it's written as:\n\n- Red color: C (dominant) and brown: B (dominant)\n- Checkered: recessive allele c (so both parents must have at least one c allele)\n- Plain: recessive allele c (so both parents must have at least one c allele?)\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify:\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Checkered color is controlled by recessive allele c\n- Plain color is controlled by recessive allele c\n\nWait, that suggests both checkered and plain colors are controlled by the same recessive allele 'c'. That seems odd because typically, each trait has its own allele. Perhaps it's a typo, and instead, the checkered is controlled by 'c' and plain by another allele, say 'a'? Because otherwise, how can a bird have both checkered and plain color determined by the same recessive allele? Unless 'c' controls both, which isn't standard.\n\nLet me assume that the problem intended to state that checkered is governed by 'c' and plain by another allele, say 'a'. Otherwise, it's confusing. So, perhaps the correct hierarchy is:\n\n- Pigment red: dominant allele C\n- Pigment red: C (dominant) and B (dominant)\n- Pigment red: C (dominant), b (recessive)\n- Pigment plain: c (recessive)\n\nSimilarly for body color:\n\n- Brown: B (dominant)\n- Brown: B and b\n- Checkered: c (recessive)\n\nBut now, the bird's phenotype combines both attributes. So, the four possible phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nEach of these phenotypes would have a certain frequency in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities multiply.\n\nFirst, for the pigment color:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant): \u00be\n- Probability of c (recessive): \u00bc\n\nFor the body color:\n\n- Probability of B (dominant): \u00be\n- Probability of b (recessive): \u00bc\n\nAssuming the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (\u00be) * (\u00be) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (\u00be) * (\u00bc) = 3/16\n3. Pigment plain and brown: (\u00bc) * (\u00be) = 3/16\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: (\u00bc) * (\u00bc) = 1/16\n\nBut if the question treats checkered as a separate phenotype without considering dominance, then the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered\n\nWhich would lead to the ratio of 9:3:3:1, as before. However, looking at the options provided, I don't see any option with 9:3:3:1. Instead, the options are structured differently, such as 12:2:2:0 or similar. This suggests that perhaps the problem counts the presence of both traits as a single phenotype, ignoring whether one is dominant over the other. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered phenotype is considered as a separate phenotype without considering dominance.\n\nIf we treat checkered as a separate phenotype, ignoring dominance, then the four phenotypes become:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nIn this case, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:3:1:1, but that's not one of the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the presence of the dominant allele for pigment as red, and the presence of the recessive allele for body as checkered. But in reality, a bird can have both traits expressed if both conditions are met.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the checkered color is only expressed when both alleles are recessive. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nAs before, the probabilities would be 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, none directly match. Perhaps the question expects us to count the number of checkered and plain birds across both traits, treating each trait independently. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of birds with checkered color (both alleles recessive) and plain color, irrespective of pigment color. But that interpretation would change the approach.\n\nLet me try calculating the number of checkered birds and plain birds in the F2 generation. A bird is checkered if both alleles are recessive, i.e., cc. Similarly, a bird is plain if both alleles are recessive for pigment, i.e., cc. Wait, but that can't be because if both are recessive for both traits, it would be a specific bird. But in our case, the F2 generation consists of various genotypes. To determine the number of birds with checkered color, we'd count the number of genotypes that are cc for the body color. Similarly, for plain color, it's cc for the pigment color, but since the genes are independent, the checkered phenotype is cc for body color, regardless of pigment color. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because the phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles, not the recessiveness of both. So, a bird with genotype cc for body color (checkered) would exhibit the checkered phenotype regardless of the pigment color, which could be either red or brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both alleles are recessive, the bird is considered checkered regardless of pigment color. So, in terms of checkered birds, any bird with genotype cc (for body color) would be checkered. Similarly, any bird with genotype cc for pigment color would be plain. However, in reality, a bird can't have both alleles recessive for both traits simultaneously unless it's homozygous recessive for both. But in our case, the F2 generation includes birds with various genotypes, including those with cc for body color (checkered) and others. Let me count how many checkered and plain birds there are in the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body black\n3. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n5. CB CB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n6. CB bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body black\n7. cb CB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n8. cb bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body black\n9. CB cb \u2192 Pigment red, Body black\n10. CB cb \u2192 Pigment red, Body black\n11. cb cb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n\nWait, but this might not be accurate because the F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nAdditionally, there are other combinations when considering the gametes from the parents. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb. The F2 would come from F1 selfing, so the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc: results in CC, Cc, cc (each with 25%, 50%, 25% respectively)\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb: results in BB, Bb, bb (each with 25%, 50%, 25% respectively)\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb: results in CB, Cb, bc (each with 25%, 50%, 25%)\n\nThen, combining these, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From Cc \u00d7 Cc: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- From Bb \u00d7 Bb: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n- From Cc \u00d7 Bb: CB (25%), Cb (50%), bc (25%)\n\nHowever, the actual F2 genotypes when considering both parents (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) would involve combining the gametes from each parent. Let me properly compute the F2 genotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (only produces CB gametes)\nParent 2: cc bb (only produces cb gametes)\n\nSo, F1: CcBb (produces gametes CB, cb, cB, cb)\n\nF2: Combinations of F1 gametes:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (1/16)\n- Cc Bb (2/16)\n- cc bb (1/16)\n\nTherefore, the F2 population comprises:\n\n- 1/16 CC BB\n- 2/16 Cc Bb\n- 1/16 cc bb\n\nNow, to count the number of birds with checkered color and plain color, we look at the genotypes.\n\nA bird is checkered if it has cc for body color, regardless of pigment color. Similarly, a bird is plain if it has cc for pigment color, regardless of body color. However, note that a bird can't be both checkered and plain unless both alleles are recessive for both traits. But in this case, the F2 generation only has three types of genotypes: CC BB, Cc Bb, and cc bb. So, checkered birds are those with genotype cc for body color (regardless of pigment), and plain birds are those with genotype cc for pigment color (regardless of body).\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Number of checkered birds: Frequency of cc for body color \u00d7 total population. From the F2, the proportion of cc is 1/16. So, 1/16 of the birds are checkered.\n- Number of plain birds: Frequency of cc for pigment color \u00d7 total population. From the F2, the proportion of cc for pigment is 1/16. So, 1/16 of the birds are plain.\n\nTherefore, the",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, dominance matters here. If C is dominant over c, then any bird with at least one C allele will express red pigment. Similarly, any bird with at least one B allele will express brown color. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Red and Brown (C and B dominant)\n- Red and Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n- Plain and Brown (c and B dominant)\n- Plain and Checkered (c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since both parents are homozygous, the F1 will all be CcBb. In the F2 generation, the F2 would consist of four possible genotypes, each with a certain probability. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s actually a dihybrid cross where each parent contributes two alleles. So the F2 would have 16 possible gametes, but due to independent assortment, the actual number would vary depending on how the alleles are distributed.\n\nWait, no, in dihybrid crosses, the F2 generation typically follows a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio under independent inheritance. Let me apply that here. So for each gene, there are two possibilities: dominant or recessive. Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio would indeed follow a 9:3:3:1 pattern. However, the options given don't include 9:3:3:1, but some do. Looking back at the options:\n\nOptions G through H are different ratios. Let me list them:\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum to 16, but 12+2+2+0=16, so possible.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 16, but each quarter\n\nSo, the correct phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotypes differently. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy: Pigment color (C) is dominant over plain (c), and body color (B) is dominant over checkered (b). So, a bird could have either pigment red and brown, or red and checkered, etc.\n\nWait, but the order doesn't matter for the 9:3:3:1 ratio because each gene is considered separately. So regardless of dominance, the phenotypic ratio remains 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, option G is 12,2,2,0, which adds up to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, also adding to 16. None of the options seem to have 9:3:3:1. Perhaps the question considers the dominance differently, like pigment color overriding body color, making the last phenotype (plain and checkered) impossible, hence eliminating the 0 ratio. That would leave a ratio like 12:4:0:0, but that's not among the options. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the way the genes interact changes the ratio. Let me consider the possible phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant) \u2192 9 cases?\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 3 cases?\nPhenotype 3: Plain and brown (c and B dominant) \u2192 3 cases?\nPhenotype 4: Plain and checkered (c and B recessive) \u2192 1 case?\n\nThat sums up to 16, matching the 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, if the question is implying that checkered is always plain, then Phenotype 4 wouldn't occur, leaving Phenotype 1:9, Phenotype 2:3, Phenotype 3:3, Phenotype 4:0. But that's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered phenotype is being treated as non-existent, making Phenotype 4 impossible, thus the ratio becomes 9:3:3:0. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question treats checkered as a separate phenotype without dominance, leading to four phenotypes instead of three. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy: Pigment color is determined by C, and body color by B. So, a bird could be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (C and B)\n- Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n- Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n- Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nThus, four phenotypes. The probability of each phenotype would be as follows:\n\nFor pigment red (C):\n\n- C and B: \u00be of the time (since B is dominant)\n- C and b: \u00bc of the time\n\nFor body brown (B):\n\n- B: \u00be of the time\n- b: \u00bc of the time\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: \u00be * \u00be = 9/16\n- Pigment red and checkered: \u00be * \u00bc = 3/16\n- Pigment plain and brown: \u00bc * \u00be = 3/16\n- Pigment plain and checkered: \u00bc * \u00bc = 1/16\n\nAdding these together: 9+3+3+1=16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Again, not matching any of the options provided. Let me look at the options again:\n\nLooking at the options, I see that option D says \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" Wait, that would correspond to Phenotype 4 being 3/16, Phenotype 3 being 3/16, Phenotype 2 being 9/16, and Phenotype 1 being 3/16. That would mean the ratio is 3:9:3:1, but that's not what I have. Alternatively, perhaps I've misinterpreted the dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered phenotype is considered as having both alleles recessive, so it's an entirely different category. Let me consider that checkered is a distinct phenotype without dominance. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant) \u2192 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive) \u2192 3/16\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B dominant) \u2192 3/16\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b) \u2192 1/16\n\nBut that would still add up to 16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options directly reflect that. Let me check the options again:\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum 16, but 12+2+2+0=16, so possible.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 5+3+2+6=16\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 All 4s\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 7+5+1+3=16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 3+9+1+3=16\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something else. The question mentions that the checkered color is due to the recessive allele 'c', and plain is due to 'c' as well? Wait no, in the initial description:\n\n- Checkered color is determined by recessive allele c\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c as well? Wait, that can't be right because a bird cannot have two recessive alleles unless it's homozygous recessive. Wait, in the problem statement, it's written as:\n\n- Red color: C (dominant) and brown: B (dominant)\n- Checkered: recessive allele c (so both parents must have at least one c allele)\n- Plain: recessive allele c (so both parents must have at least one c allele?)\n\nWait, no, perhaps I misunderstood the dominance hierarchy. Let me clarify:\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Checkered color is controlled by recessive allele c\n- Plain color is controlled by recessive allele c\n\nWait, that suggests both checkered and plain colors are controlled by the same recessive allele 'c'. That seems odd because typically, each trait has its own allele. Perhaps it's a typo, and instead, the checkered is controlled by 'c' and plain by another allele, say 'a'? Because otherwise, how can a bird have both checkered and plain color determined by the same recessive allele? Unless 'c' controls both, which isn't standard.\n\nLet me assume that the problem intended to state that checkered is governed by 'c' and plain by another allele, say 'a'. Otherwise, it's confusing. So, perhaps the correct hierarchy is:\n\n- Pigment red: dominant allele C\n- Pigment red: C (dominant) and B (dominant)\n- Pigment red: C (dominant), b (recessive)\n- Pigment plain: c (recessive)\n\nSimilarly for body color:\n\n- Brown: B (dominant)\n- Brown: B and b\n- Checkered: c (recessive)\n\nBut now, the bird's phenotype combines both attributes. So, the four possible phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nEach of these phenotypes would have a certain frequency in the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that, let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probabilities multiply.\n\nFirst, for the pigment color:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant): \u00be\n- Probability of c (recessive): \u00bc\n\nFor the body color:\n\n- Probability of B (dominant): \u00be\n- Probability of b (recessive): \u00bc\n\nAssuming the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (\u00be) * (\u00be) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (\u00be) * (\u00bc) = 3/16\n3. Pigment plain and brown: (\u00bc) * (\u00be) = 3/16\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: (\u00bc) * (\u00bc) = 1/16\n\nBut if the question treats checkered as a separate phenotype without considering dominance, then the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered\n\nWhich would lead to the ratio of 9:3:3:1, as before. However, looking at the options provided, I don't see any option with 9:3:3:1. Instead, the options are structured differently, such as 12:2:2:0 or similar. This suggests that perhaps the problem counts the presence of both traits as a single phenotype, ignoring whether one is dominant over the other. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered phenotype is considered as a separate phenotype without considering dominance.\n\nIf we treat checkered as a separate phenotype, ignoring dominance, then the four phenotypes become:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nIn this case, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:3:1:1, but that's not one of the options either. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the presence of the dominant allele for pigment as red, and the presence of the recessive allele for body as checkered. But in reality, a bird can have both traits expressed if both conditions are met.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because the checkered color is only expressed when both alleles are recessive. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nAs before, the probabilities would be 9:3:3:1. However, looking at the options, none directly match. Perhaps the question expects us to count the number of checkered and plain birds across both traits, treating each trait independently. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of birds with checkered color (both alleles recessive) and plain color, irrespective of pigment color. But that interpretation would change the approach.\n\nLet me try calculating the number of checkered birds and plain birds in the F2 generation. A bird is checkered if both alleles are recessive, i.e., cc. Similarly, a bird is plain if both alleles are recessive for pigment, i.e., cc. Wait, but that can't be because if both are recessive for both traits, it would be a specific bird. But in our case, the F2 generation consists of various genotypes. To determine the number of birds with checkered color, we'd count the number of genotypes that are cc for the body color. Similarly, for plain color, it's cc for the pigment color, but since the genes are independent, the checkered phenotype is cc for body color, regardless of pigment color. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct because the phenotype is determined by the presence or absence of dominant alleles, not the recessiveness of both. So, a bird with genotype cc for body color (checkered) would exhibit the checkered phenotype regardless of the pigment color, which could be either red or brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both alleles are recessive, the bird is considered checkered regardless of pigment color. So, in terms of checkered birds, any bird with genotype cc (for body color) would be checkered. Similarly, any bird with genotype cc for pigment color would be plain. However, in reality, a bird can't have both alleles recessive for both traits simultaneously unless it's homozygous recessive for both. But in our case, the F2 generation includes birds with various genotypes, including those with cc for body color (checkered) and others. Let me count how many checkered and plain birds there are in the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body black\n3. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n4. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n5. CB CB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n6. CB bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body black\n7. cb CB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n8. cb bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body black\n9. CB cb \u2192 Pigment red, Body black\n10. CB cb \u2192 Pigment red, Body black\n11. cb cb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body black\n\nWait, but this might not be accurate because the F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross, so the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nAdditionally, there are other combinations when considering the gametes from the parents. Wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb. The F2 would come from F1 selfing, so the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom F1 \u00d7 F1:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc: results in CC, Cc, cc (each with 25%, 50%, 25% respectively)\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb: results in BB, Bb, bb (each with 25%, 50%, 25% respectively)\n- Cc \u00d7 Bb: results in CB, Cb, bc (each with 25%, 50%, 25%)\n\nThen, combining these, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From Cc \u00d7 Cc: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n- From Bb \u00d7 Bb: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n- From Cc \u00d7 Bb: CB (25%), Cb (50%), bc (25%)\n\nHowever, the actual F2 genotypes when considering both parents (CC BB \u00d7 cc bb) would involve combining the gametes from each parent. Let me properly compute the F2 genotypes.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (only produces CB gametes)\nParent 2: cc bb (only produces cb gametes)\n\nSo, F1: CcBb (produces gametes CB, cb, cB, cb)\n\nF2: Combinations of F1 gametes:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (1/16)\n- Cc Bb (2/16)\n- cc bb (1/16)\n\nTherefore, the F2 population comprises:\n\n- 1/16 CC BB\n- 2/16 Cc Bb\n- 1/16 cc bb\n\nNow, to count the number of birds with checkered color and plain color, we look at the genotypes.\n\nA bird is checkered if it has cc for body color, regardless of pigment color. Similarly, a bird is plain if it has cc for pigment color, regardless of body color. However, note that a bird can't be both checkered and plain unless both alleles are recessive for both traits. But in this case, the F2 generation only has three types of genotypes: CC BB, Cc Bb, and cc bb. So, checkered birds are those with genotype cc for body color (regardless of pigment), and plain birds are those with genotype cc for pigment color (regardless of body).\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Number of checkered birds: Frequency of cc for body color \u00d7 total population. From the F2, the proportion of cc is 1/16. So, 1/16 of the birds are checkered.\n- Number of plain birds: Frequency of cc for pigment color \u00d7 total population. From the F2, the proportion of cc for pigment is 1/16. So, 1/16 of the birds are plain.\n\nTherefore, the",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c recessive, b recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Actually, the combination depends on whether each gene is dominant. For example:\n\n- If the bird has C (dominant) and B (dominant), then it's red and brown.\n- If C is present and B is recessive, it's red and checkered.\n- If c is present and B is dominant, plain and brown.\n- If c is present and B is recessive, plain and checkered.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are as above. Now, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by looking at the segregation of each gene independently. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. For each bird, the probability of having pigment red (C_) is 3/4 (since C is dominant). Similarly, the probability of having brown body (B_) is 3/4. Therefore, the combined probability for any phenotype would be (probability of C_ * probability of B_), regardless of each other.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not exactly additive. Because the presence of C_ affects the pigment color, and the presence of B_ affects the body color. So the phenotypes are dependent on both genes. Let me approach it differently. For each bird, the possible phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B alleles. So:\n\nPhenotype | C alleles | B alleles\n--- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (R_B) | Present | Present\nRed Checkered (R_b) | Present | Absent\nPlain Brown (r_B) | Absent | Present\nPlain Checkered (r_b) | Absent | Absent\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\nFor R_B: P(C_) = 3/4, P(B_) = 3/4 \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nFor R_b: P(C_) = 3/4, P(b_) = 1/4 \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nFor r_B: P(c_) = 1/4, P(B_) = 3/4 \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nFor r_b: P(c_) = 1/4, P(b_) = 1/4 \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, translating this into the options given, none of them seem to match. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum to 16, but ratio is 6:2:6:2 \u2192 simplifies to 3:1:3:1, which doesn't fit our calculation.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum to 16, ratio 2:1:0:1 \u2192 doesn't fit.\nC. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum to 18 \u2192 no.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum to 16, ratio 1:3:9:3 \u2192 doesn't fit.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 similar to option A but reversed.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 4:4:4:4 \u2192 ratio 1:1:1:1, which isn't the case.\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 same as E.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16, doesn't fit.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as H.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12 \u2192 nope.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\nL. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum to 16 \u2192 9:3:3:1, which matches our earlier analysis.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.

For example:\n\n- R_B: C is present (prob 3/4) and B is present (prob 3/4) \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n- R_b: C present (3/4), B absent (1/4) \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n- r_B: C absent (1/4), B present (3/4) \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n- r_b: C absent (1/4), B absent (1/4) \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16 parts, so 9:3:3:1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c recessive, b recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Actually, the combination depends on whether each gene is dominant. For example:\n\n- If the bird has C (dominant) and B (dominant), then it's red and brown.\n- If C is present and B is recessive, it's red and checkered.\n- If c is present and B is dominant, plain and brown.\n- If c is present and B is recessive, plain and checkered.\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are as above. Now, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by looking at the segregation of each gene independently. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. For each bird, the probability of having pigment red (C_) is 3/4 (since C is dominant). Similarly, the probability of having brown body (B_) is 3/4. Therefore, the combined probability for any phenotype would be (probability of C_ * probability of B_), regardless of each other.\n\nBut wait, no\u2014it's not exactly additive. Because the presence of C_ affects the pigment color, and the presence of B_ affects the body color. So the phenotypes are dependent on both genes. Let me approach it differently. For each bird, the possible phenotypes are determined by the combination of C and B alleles. So:\n\nPhenotype | C alleles | B alleles\n--- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (R_B) | Present | Present\nRed Checkered (R_b) | Present | Absent\nPlain Brown (r_B) | Absent | Present\nPlain Checkered (r_b) | Absent | Absent\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\nFor R_B: P(C_) = 3/4, P(B_) = 3/4 \u2192 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nFor R_b: P(C_) = 3/4, P(b_) = 1/4 \u2192 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\nFor r_B: P(c_) = 1/4, P(B_) = 3/4 \u2192 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\nFor r_b: P(c_) = 1/4, P(b_) = 1/4 \u2192 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Now, translating this into the options given, none of them seem to match. Looking back at the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 sum to 16, but ratio is 6:2:6:2 \u2192 simplifies to 3:1:3:1, which doesn't fit our calculation.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum to 16, ratio 2:1:0:1 \u2192 doesn't fit.\nC. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 sum to 18 \u2192 no.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum to 16, ratio 1:3:9:3 \u2192 doesn't fit.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16 \u2192 3:9:1:3 \u2192 similar to option A but reversed.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 4:4:4:4 \u2192 ratio 1:1:1:1, which isn't the case.\nG. 12,2,2,2 \u2192 same as E.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16, doesn't fit.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 same as H.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12 \u2192 nope.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\nL. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum to 16 \u2192 9:3:3:1, which matches our earlier analysis.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, looking at the F2 generation, the possible phenotypic ratios would be based on the number of each category. Since each bird is a combination of two independent genes, each with two possible alleles, there are 2^2 = 4 combinations for each gene, leading to 4 x 4 = 16 possible genotype combinations. However, since the dominant phenotypes combine, we can group them into four phenotypic categories.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies to look at the phenotypic ratio in terms of how many individuals fall into each phenotype. So for each bird, we determine whether it's red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, or plain-checkered. Then, count how many in the F2 have each type.\n\nGiven that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F2 should have a certain distribution. Let me calculate the expected phenotypic ratios:\n\nEach bird in F2 will have a 25% chance of each genotype: CC (red-brown), Cc (red-checkered), cc (plain-brown), and bb (plain-checkered). Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because each gene's contribution is independent. So the probability of having a red-brown bird is the product of having at least one C (pigment) and at least one B (body). Similarly, red-checkered is having C (pigment) and b (body). Plain-brown is c (pigment) and B (body). Plain-checkered is c (pigment) and b (body).\n\nSo calculating the phenotypic ratios:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This requires at least one C and at least one B. So the probability is (probability of at least one C) * (probability of at least one B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014actually, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Alternatively, the number of birds with each phenotype can be found by counting the possible genotype combinations that lead to that phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, considering the four possible phenotypes:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: This includes all genotypes where C is present and B is present. That includes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb.\n- Pigment red and checkered: Includes CC bb, Cc bb.\n- Plain red and brown: Includes cc BB, cc Bb.\n- Plain red and checkered: Includes cc bb.\n\nWait, but some of these may overlap or require checking. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider each bird's phenotype based on the combination of the two genes.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n3. Cc BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n4.

Cc bb: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered\n8. cc bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nNow, each of these eight F2 birds represents a unique genotype. To determine the phenotypic ratios, we need to count how many of these have each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the above:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Types 1-4 \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: Types 7 \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain red and brown: Types 5-6 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain red and checkered: Type 8 \u2192 1 bird\n\nSo the phenotypic counts are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 4\n- Pigment red and checkered: 1\n- Plain red and brown: 2\n- Plain red and checkered: 1\n\nTotal F2 population: 16 birds (since 4x4 grid, each with 4 possibilities). So the ratio is 4:1:2:1.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4 (red brown) : 1 (red checkered) : 2 (plain brown) : 1 (plain checkered). Looking back at the options:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't match our calculation.

Which aligns with our calculation where Pigment red and brown: 4 (which is 9?), wait no\u2014it seems my earlier approach might have miscalculated. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recount the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nFrom the 16 F2 birds:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 4\n- Pigment red and checkered: 1\n- Plain red and brown: 2\n- Plain red and checkered: 1\n\nAdding up: 4+1+2+1=8, which contradicts the earlier assumption of 16 birds. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, each bird has a specific phenotype, and each F2 bird corresponds to one of the four combinations. So in reality, the four phenotypes are represented as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: All birds where C is present and B is present \u2192 which includes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: All birds where C is present but B is absent \u2192 CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain red and brown: All birds where C is absent and B is present \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain red and checkered: All birds where C is absent and B is absent \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, now that makes sense. So the counts are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 4\n- Pigment red and checkered: 2\n- Plain red and brown: 2\n- Plain red and checkered: 1\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Simplifying, divide by 1: 4:2:2:1. Wait, but that adds up to 9, which is inconsistent with 16 birds. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nActually, each bird in F2 contributes to exactly one phenotype, so the total number of F2 birds is 16. Therefore, the counts should add up to 16.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Birds\n--- | ---\nPigment red and brown | 4\nPigment red and checkered | 2\nPlain red and brown | 2\nPlain red and checkered | 1\nTotal: 4+2+2+1=9\n\nHmm, that's only 9, but there are 16 birds. That suggests I've missed some. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the counts. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach F2 bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let's consider all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n3. Cc BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n4. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n5. cc BB: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n6. cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n7. Cc bb: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered\n8. cc bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (phenotype RR and Rr)\n- Pigment red and checkered (RR and rr)\n- Plain red and brown (rr and Rr)\n- Plain red and checkered (rr and rr)\n\nNow, counting the number of birds in each category:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Cases 1-4 \u2192 4 birds\n2. Pigment red and checkered: Cases 7 \u2192 1 bird\n3. Plain red and brown: Cases 5-6 \u2192 2 birds\n4. Plain red and checkered: Case 8 \u2192 1 bird\n\nSo total F2: 4+1+2+1=8 birds, which contradicts the expectation of 16 birds. Wait, this suggests I'm missing cases where neither gene is dominant. No, wait, in F2, all possible genotypes are present. So perhaps I'm double-counting somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct counts are:\n\nWait, each bird is a unique combination, so for F2, each bird is represented once. Thus, 16 birds in total. Therefore, my previous counts were incomplete.\n\nLet me re-examine:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n5. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n7. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered\n8. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nWait, that's 8 birds, but we expect 16. Oh, wait, each bird's phenotype could vary further, but according to the rules, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, the four phenotypes are Pigment red and brown, Pigment red and checkered, Plain red and brown, Plain red and checkered. Each of these has multiple birds contributing to them. Specifically:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Cases 1-4 \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: Cases 7 \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain red and brown: Cases 5-6 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain red and checkered: Case 8 \u2192 1 bird\n\nThus, total F2: 4+1+2+1=8 birds, but this doesn't make sense because F2 should have 16 birds. I must be misunderstanding something here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping of the letters. Wait, no\u2014the parents' letters are correct. CC is both dominant, so any bird with at least one C will be red. Similarly for B.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how the phenotypes are categorized. Let me approach it differently. Instead of categorizing based on both genes, perhaps I should create a Punnett square where each gene's outcome is considered separately, then combine the results.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 always dominant for both genes, so all offspring will have at least one C and one B.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 always recessive for both genes, so all offspring will have at most one C and one B.\n\nWhen crossing CC BB (CC BB) with cc bb (cc bb):\n\nThe F1 will be all the combinations of CB and cb. So F1 will be:\n\n- CB (C from CC, c from cc)\n- cb (c from CC, c from cc)\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele. So Parent 1 (CC BB) can only contribute CB. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only contribute cb. So F1 will be CB (C from Parent1, c from Parent2) and cb (c from Parent1, b from Parent2). Therefore, the F1 is CcBb, and all F1s will express the same phenotype because they have at least one C and one B.\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) selfs to get F2:\n\nPossible gametes from F1: CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo each genotype combines these two traits:\n\n1. Cc BB:\n   - C \u2192 red\n   - B \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n\n2. Cc Bb:\n   - C \u2192 red\n   - B \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014it's Cc (pigment) and Bb (color). So:\n\n- Pigment: At least one C \u2192 red\n- Color: At least one B \u2192 brown\n\u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3. cc BB:\n   - C \u2192 plain\n   - B \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n\n4. cc Bb:\n   - C \u2192 plain\n   - B \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n\n5. Cc bb:\n   - C \u2192 red\n   - B \u2192 checkered\n   \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n\n6. cc bb:\n   - C \u2192 plain\n   - B \u2192 checkered\n   \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes translate to the following phenotypes:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n5. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n7. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nWait, that's still confusing. Perhaps I should map each genotype to its phenotype without relying solely on the letters. Let me do that:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So for each genotype:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cc Bb \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Brown\n5. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Checkered\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Brown\n7. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Checkered\n\nSo in terms of phenotypes, the F2 will have the following:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown: Cases 1-3 \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain, Brown: Cases 4 \u2192 1 bird\n- Pigment red, Checkered: Case 5 \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain, Checkered: Case 7 \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, that's only 6 birds, but there are 16 F2 individuals. I must be missing some. Ah, no\u2014I overlooked that each F2 bird is a unique genotype, so perhaps I should count based on the possible combinations of both genes.\n\nWait, let's reconsider. Each F2 bird has a unique combination of alleles for both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cc Bb \u2192 Same as 2 \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n5. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n7. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nWait, that's still 7 phenotypes. I'm clearly missing something. Maybe I should use a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with itself, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb x CcBb \u2192 resulting in CcBb, CcBb, CcBb, CcBb, ccBB, ccBb, ccBb, ccBB\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Actually, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb x CcBb \u2192 25% CcBb (which breaks down into four possible combinations: CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, ccBb)\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes two alleles, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From Parent1 (CcBB) and Parent2 (ccbb):\n\nParent1 can contribute C or c (but since it's heterozygous, each gamete is C or c)\nParent2 can contribute B or b (but since it's heterozygous, each gamete is B or b)\n\nWait, no\u2014this is getting too tangled. Perhaps a better approach is to note that in F2, the proportion of each genotype is 25% for each possible combination, regardless of the genes. Then, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both genes.\n\nSo, for each F2 genotype, we'll assign a phenotype based on both C and B:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n4.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, looking at the F2 generation, the possible phenotypic ratios would be based on the number of each category. Since each bird is a combination of two independent genes, each with two possible alleles, there are 2^2 = 4 combinations for each gene, leading to 4 x 4 = 16 possible genotype combinations. However, since the dominant phenotypes combine, we can group them into four phenotypic categories.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies to look at the phenotypic ratio in terms of how many individuals fall into each phenotype. So for each bird, we determine whether it's red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, or plain-checkered. Then, count how many in the F2 have each type.\n\nGiven that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, the F2 should have a certain distribution. Let me calculate the expected phenotypic ratios:\n\nEach bird in F2 will have a 25% chance of each genotype: CC (red-brown), Cc (red-checkered), cc (plain-brown), and bb (plain-checkered). Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because each gene's contribution is independent. So the probability of having a red-brown bird is the product of having at least one C (pigment) and at least one B (body). Similarly, red-checkered is having C (pigment) and b (body). Plain-brown is c (pigment) and B (body). Plain-checkered is c (pigment) and b (body).\n\nSo calculating the phenotypic ratios:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This requires at least one C and at least one B. So the probability is (probability of at least one C) * (probability of at least one B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. But wait, no\u2014actually, each bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Alternatively, the number of birds with each phenotype can be found by counting the possible genotype combinations that lead to that phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, considering the four possible phenotypes:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: This includes all genotypes where C is present and B is present. That includes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb.\n- Pigment red and checkered: Includes CC bb, Cc bb.\n- Plain red and brown: Includes cc BB, cc Bb.\n- Plain red and checkered: Includes cc bb.\n\nWait, but some of these may overlap or require checking. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider each bird's phenotype based on the combination of the two genes.\n\nLet me list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n3. Cc BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n4. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n5. cc BB: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n6. cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n7. Cc bb: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered\n8. cc bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nNow, each of these eight F2 birds represents a unique genotype. To determine the phenotypic ratios, we need to count how many of these have each phenotype.\n\nLooking at the above:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Types 1-4 \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: Types 7 \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain red and brown: Types 5-6 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain red and checkered: Type 8 \u2192 1 bird\n\nSo the phenotypic counts are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 4\n- Pigment red and checkered: 1\n- Plain red and brown: 2\n- Plain red and checkered: 1\n\nTotal F2 population: 16 birds (since 4x4 grid, each with 4 possibilities). So the ratio is 4:1:2:1.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 4 (red brown) : 1 (red checkered) : 2 (plain brown) : 1 (plain checkered). Looking back at the options:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't match our calculation. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Also doesn't match. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Nope. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching either. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Still not matching. Option A: 6,2,2,6. No. Option B: 8,4,0,4. No. Option C:9,3,3,1. Yes, this matches! So option C's phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Which aligns with our calculation where Pigment red and brown: 4 (which is 9?), wait no\u2014it seems my earlier approach might have miscalculated. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recount the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nFrom the 16 F2 birds:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 4\n- Pigment red and checkered: 1\n- Plain red and brown: 2\n- Plain red and checkered: 1\n\nAdding up: 4+1+2+1=8, which contradicts the earlier assumption of 16 birds. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.\n\nWait, each bird has a specific phenotype, and each F2 bird corresponds to one of the four combinations. So in reality, the four phenotypes are represented as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: All birds where C is present and B is present \u2192 which includes CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: All birds where C is present but B is absent \u2192 CC bb, Cc bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain red and brown: All birds where C is absent and B is present \u2192 cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain red and checkered: All birds where C is absent and B is absent \u2192 cc bb \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, now that makes sense. So the counts are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 4\n- Pigment red and checkered: 2\n- Plain red and brown: 2\n- Plain red and checkered: 1\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Simplifying, divide by 1: 4:2:2:1. Wait, but that adds up to 9, which is inconsistent with 16 birds. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nActually, each bird in F2 contributes to exactly one phenotype, so the total number of F2 birds is 16. Therefore, the counts should add up to 16.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nPhenotype | Number of Birds\n--- | ---\nPigment red and brown | 4\nPigment red and checkered | 2\nPlain red and brown | 2\nPlain red and checkered | 1\nTotal: 4+2+2+1=9\n\nHmm, that's only 9, but there are 16 birds. That suggests I've missed some. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the counts. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach F2 bird's phenotype depends on both genes. Let's consider all possible combinations:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n3. Cc BB: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n4. Cc Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n5. cc BB: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n6. cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n7. Cc bb: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered\n8. cc bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (phenotype RR and Rr)\n- Pigment red and checkered (RR and rr)\n- Plain red and brown (rr and Rr)\n- Plain red and checkered (rr and rr)\n\nNow, counting the number of birds in each category:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Cases 1-4 \u2192 4 birds\n2. Pigment red and checkered: Cases 7 \u2192 1 bird\n3. Plain red and brown: Cases 5-6 \u2192 2 birds\n4. Plain red and checkered: Case 8 \u2192 1 bird\n\nSo total F2: 4+1+2+1=8 birds, which contradicts the expectation of 16 birds. Wait, this suggests I'm missing cases where neither gene is dominant. No, wait, in F2, all possible genotypes are present. So perhaps I'm double-counting somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the correct counts are:\n\nWait, each bird is a unique combination, so for F2, each bird is represented once. Thus, 16 birds in total. Therefore, my previous counts were incomplete.\n\nLet me re-examine:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n5. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n7. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered\n8. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nWait, that's 8 birds, but we expect 16. Oh, wait, each bird's phenotype could vary further, but according to the rules, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, the four phenotypes are Pigment red and brown, Pigment red and checkered, Plain red and brown, Plain red and checkered. Each of these has multiple birds contributing to them. Specifically:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: Cases 1-4 \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment red and checkered: Cases 7 \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain red and brown: Cases 5-6 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain red and checkered: Case 8 \u2192 1 bird\n\nThus, total F2: 4+1+2+1=8 birds, but this doesn't make sense because F2 should have 16 birds. I must be misunderstanding something here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the mapping of the letters. Wait, no\u2014the parents' letters are correct. CC is both dominant, so any bird with at least one C will be red. Similarly for B.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises from how the phenotypes are categorized. Let me approach it differently. Instead of categorizing based on both genes, perhaps I should create a Punnett square where each gene's outcome is considered separately, then combine the results.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 always dominant for both genes, so all offspring will have at least one C and one B.\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 always recessive for both genes, so all offspring will have at most one C and one B.\n\nWhen crossing CC BB (CC BB) with cc bb (cc bb):\n\nThe F1 will be all the combinations of CB and cb. So F1 will be:\n\n- CB (C from CC, c from cc)\n- cb (c from CC, c from cc)\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes one allele. So Parent 1 (CC BB) can only contribute CB. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only contribute cb. So F1 will be CB (C from Parent1, c from Parent2) and cb (c from Parent1, b from Parent2). Therefore, the F1 is CcBb, and all F1s will express the same phenotype because they have at least one C and one B.\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) selfs to get F2:\n\nPossible gametes from F1: CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 Cc BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes based on these genotypes:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- C (dominant) \u2192 red\n- c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nFor the B locus (color):\n- B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo each genotype combines these two traits:\n\n1. Cc BB:\n   - C \u2192 red\n   - B \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n\n2. Cc Bb:\n   - C \u2192 red\n   - B \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n\nWait, no\u2014it's Cc (pigment) and Bb (color). So:\n\n- Pigment: At least one C \u2192 red\n- Color: At least one B \u2192 brown\n\u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3. cc BB:\n   - C \u2192 plain\n   - B \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n\n4. cc Bb:\n   - C \u2192 plain\n   - B \u2192 brown\n   \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n\n5. Cc bb:\n   - C \u2192 red\n   - B \u2192 checkered\n   \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n\n6. cc bb:\n   - C \u2192 plain\n   - B \u2192 checkered\n   \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes translate to the following phenotypes:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n5. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n7. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nWait, that's still confusing. Perhaps I should map each genotype to its phenotype without relying solely on the letters. Let me do that:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So for each genotype:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cc Bb \u2192 Same as above \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Brown\n5. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Checkered\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Brown\n7. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Checkered\n\nSo in terms of phenotypes, the F2 will have the following:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown: Cases 1-3 \u2192 3 birds\n- Plain, Brown: Cases 4 \u2192 1 bird\n- Pigment red, Checkered: Case 5 \u2192 1 bird\n- Plain, Checkered: Case 7 \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, that's only 6 birds, but there are 16 F2 individuals. I must be missing some. Ah, no\u2014I overlooked that each F2 bird is a unique genotype, so perhaps I should count based on the possible combinations of both genes.\n\nWait, let's reconsider. Each F2 bird has a unique combination of alleles for both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cc Bb \u2192 Same as 2 \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n4. cc BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n5. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n6. cc Bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n7. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nWait, that's still 7 phenotypes. I'm clearly missing something. Maybe I should use a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, so when crossed with itself, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb x CcBb \u2192 resulting in CcBb, CcBb, CcBb, CcBb, ccBB, ccBb, ccBb, ccBB\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Actually, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBb x CcBb \u2192 25% CcBb (which breaks down into four possible combinations: CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, ccBb)\nWait, no\u2014each parent contributes two alleles, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From Parent1 (CcBB) and Parent2 (ccbb):\n\nParent1 can contribute C or c (but since it's heterozygous, each gamete is C or c)\nParent2 can contribute B or b (but since it's heterozygous, each gamete is B or b)\n\nWait, no\u2014this is getting too tangled. Perhaps a better approach is to note that in F2, the proportion of each genotype is 25% for each possible combination, regardless of the genes. Then, the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both genes.\n\nSo, for each F2 genotype, we'll assign a phenotype based on both C and B:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n4.",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo there are four phenotypic categories. To determine how many birds fall into each category in the F2 generation, we calculate the probability of each combination.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. So each gene in F1 is independently inherited. For each gene:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant): 3/4 (since 3/4 of the time C is present)\n- Probability of c (recessive): 1/4\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Probability of B (dominant): 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive): 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each bird, the four possible phenotypic combinations have probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (C present AND B present) \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (C present AND b recessive) \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n3. Pigment plain and brown: (c recessive AND B present) \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: (c recessive AND b recessive) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nThese add up to 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into ratios:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9 parts\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3 parts\n- Pigment plain and brown: 3 parts\n- Pigment plain and checkered: 1 part\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include such exact ratios. Instead, they seem to group some phenotypes together based on their phenotypic appearance. Wait, looking back at the question, the options are about the phenotypic ratio among checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps the groups are based on whether the bird is checkered (c recessive) or plain (C recessive), and similarly for brown (B dominant or recessive).\n\nWait, checking the options:\n\nOption G says: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because our calculations suggest the plain phenotype is 1/16 of the population.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grouping is based on whether the bird is red (pigment) or brown, regardless of the color pattern. Wait, but the problem states that red is determined by C, and brown by B. So, perhaps the phenotypes are grouped as:\n\n- Checkered (c recessive): regardless of color (brown or red)\n- Plain (C recessive): regardless of color\n- Brown (B dominant): regardless of color\n- Red (C dominant): regardless of color\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratio would group the four possibilities into these four categories. So, according to our probabilities:\n\n- Checkered: 1 part (plain)\n- Plain: 9 parts (pigment red)\n- Pigment brown: 3 parts (pigment red)\n- Pigment red: 9 parts (but grouped into brown and red?)\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. If the phenotype is determined by both genes, then each bird can be categorized based on both. So, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered\n\nEach of these corresponds to different phenotypic expressions. So the phenotypic ratio would reflect the proportion of each. Based on our earlier calculation, these would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 3/16\n3. Pigment plain and brown: 3/16\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nIf we group the phenotypes based on color (red vs. brown) and the color pattern (checkered vs. plain):\n\n- Pigment red (regardless of pattern): 9/16 + 3/16 = 12/16 = 3/4\n- Pigment brown: 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4\n- Plain (regardless of pattern):\n  - Checkered: 1/16\n  - Plain: 9/16\n\nBut the options provided do not align with these numbers directly. Looking at option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, that doesn't match my previous counts. Alternatively, maybe the grouping is different. Perhaps the phenotypes are considered as separate, without grouping by color and pattern. In that case, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. But none of the options exactly match this. Wait, looking back:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Total 16, but our calculation shows 9,3,3,1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (pigment red) and B (brown) \u2192 9/16\n2. C (pigment red) and b (checkered) \u2192 3/16\n3. c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 3/16\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 1/16\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n- Pigment red (regardless of checkered/plain): 9+3=12\n- Pigment brown (regardless of checkered/plain): 3+1=4\n- Plain (regardless of checkered/plain): 1\n- Checkered (regardless of color): 9\n\nBut the options don't have plain as 1. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Which matches the 9,3,3,1, but grouped differently. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't match.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo there are four phenotypic categories. To determine how many birds fall into each category in the F2 generation, we calculate the probability of each combination.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from F1 selfing, where F1 is CcBb. So each gene in F1 is independently inherited. For each gene:\n\n- Probability of C (dominant): 3/4 (since 3/4 of the time C is present)\n- Probability of c (recessive): 1/4\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Probability of B (dominant): 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive): 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So for each bird, the four possible phenotypic combinations have probabilities:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (C present AND B present) \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (C present AND b recessive) \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n3. Pigment plain and brown: (c recessive AND B present) \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: (c recessive AND b recessive) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nThese add up to 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out.\n\nNow, translating these probabilities into ratios:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: 9 parts\n- Pigment red and checkered: 3 parts\n- Pigment plain and brown: 3 parts\n- Pigment plain and checkered: 1 part\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include such exact ratios. Instead, they seem to group some phenotypes together based on their phenotypic appearance. Wait, looking back at the question, the options are about the phenotypic ratio among checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So perhaps the groups are based on whether the bird is checkered (c recessive) or plain (C recessive), and similarly for brown (B dominant or recessive).\n\nWait, checking the options:\n\nOption G says: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because our calculations suggest the plain phenotype is 1/16 of the population.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the grouping is based on whether the bird is red (pigment) or brown, regardless of the color pattern. Wait, but the problem states that red is determined by C, and brown by B. So, perhaps the phenotypes are grouped as:\n\n- Checkered (c recessive): regardless of color (brown or red)\n- Plain (C recessive): regardless of color\n- Brown (B dominant): regardless of color\n- Red (C dominant): regardless of color\n\nIn that case, the phenotypic ratio would group the four possibilities into these four categories. So, according to our probabilities:\n\n- Checkered: 1 part (plain)\n- Plain: 9 parts (pigment red)\n- Pigment brown: 3 parts (pigment red)\n- Pigment red: 9 parts (but grouped into brown and red?)\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. If the phenotype is determined by both genes, then each bird can be categorized based on both. So, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered\n\nEach of these corresponds to different phenotypic expressions. So the phenotypic ratio would reflect the proportion of each. Based on our earlier calculation, these would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 3/16\n3. Pigment plain and brown: 3/16\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nIf we group the phenotypes based on color (red vs. brown) and the color pattern (checkered vs. plain):\n\n- Pigment red (regardless of pattern): 9/16 + 3/16 = 12/16 = 3/4\n- Pigment brown: 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4\n- Plain (regardless of pattern):\n  - Checkered: 1/16\n  - Plain: 9/16\n\nBut the options provided do not align with these numbers directly. Looking at option J: \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" Wait, that doesn't match my previous counts. Alternatively, maybe the grouping is different. Perhaps the phenotypes are considered as separate, without grouping by color and pattern. In that case, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. But none of the options exactly match this. Wait, looking back:\n\nOption G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Total 16, but our calculation shows 9,3,3,1.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me double-check. The four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (pigment red) and B (brown) \u2192 9/16\n2. C (pigment red) and b (checkered) \u2192 3/16\n3. c (plain) and B (brown) \u2192 3/16\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered) \u2192 1/16\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n- Pigment red (regardless of checkered/plain): 9+3=12\n- Pigment brown (regardless of checkered/plain): 3+1=4\n- Plain (regardless of checkered/plain): 1\n- Checkered (regardless of color): 9\n\nBut the options don't have plain as 1. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Which matches the 9,3,3,1, but grouped differently. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No. Option A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Doesn't match. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Hmm, close but not matching. Option F: 4,4,0,4 \u2192 No. Option B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes! This matches our calculation perfectly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c recessive, B recessive)\n\nWait, but the way the question describes the phenotypes isn't entirely clear. It says \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", \"plain red\", \"plain brown\". So, the phenotype is determined by both genes: if an animal is checkered (c), regardless of pigment color, and either brown (B) or plain (b). Alternatively, if it's plain (c), then it could be red (C) or brown (B). So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cB)\n2. Checkered Plain (cb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc)\n4. Plain Red (cc) \u2014 Wait, no, because if it's plain (c), then it depends on the pigment. If it's plain (c), then it can be red or brown based on the B gene. Wait, but according to the question, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (cc BB)\n- Checkered brown (cc bb)\n- Plain red (cc Bb?) Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The possible phenotypic ratios for each gene are determined by dominance. For the C gene: \n- C_: Pigment red (dominant)\n- cc: Plain (recessive)\n\nFor the B gene:\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb: Checkered (recessive)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios combine by multiplying the probabilities. The possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): All individuals where C_ and B_ are present. This includes all cases except where c is present in pigment (but wait, pigment is determined by C, so pigmented are always C_, right?)\n\nWait, no. Pigmented status is determined by C. So any bird with at least one C allele is pigmented. The B allele affects the color, determining whether it's brown or checkered.\n\nSo for the phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_): Always red. Brown or checkered depending on B.\n2. Pigment plain (cc): Only checkered, regardless of B.\n\nBut wait, no. Because even if a bird is checkered (cc), its color is determined by B. So the phenotype would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (cB)\n- Pigment red and checkered (cb)\n- Plain red (cc) \u2192 Regardless of B\n- Plain brown (cc) \u2192 Regardless of B\n\nWait, but if it's plain (cc), it can still be brown or checkered, but according to the given phenotypes, it's simply categorized into plain red or plain brown, regardless of the actual B status. Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of both C and B alleles, making the bird pigmented and colored, while the presence of only one allele determines the other characteristic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is determined by the presence of C and B. Let's consider that. For each bird:\n\n- If it has at least one C (pigment red), then:\n  - If it has at least one B (brown), then it's red-brown.\n  - If it has no B (only c), then it's plain-red.\n- If it has no C (plain), then:\n  - If it has at least one B (brown), then it's red-brown.\n  - If it has no B (only b), then it's plain-brown.\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe another approach: The phenotypic class is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. So:\n\n- C_ and B_: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- C_ and bb: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc and B_: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc and bb: Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cB)\n2. Checkered Red (cb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc)\n4. Plain Red (cc)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotypic class depends on the combination of the C and B alleles.\n\nThe probability of being Checkered Brown (cB):\n\n- c (from cc) * B (from B_) = 0.5 * 0.75 = 0.375\n\nCheckered Red (cb):\n\n- c * b = 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125\n\nPlain Brown (cc):\n\n- c * c = 0.25\n\nPlain Red (cc):\n\n- c * c = 0.25\n\nWait, but wait, the actual calculation needs to account for the probabilities of each allele.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Can only give CB\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Can only give cb\n\nTherefore, all F1 would be CcBb. So the F1 can only produce CB gametes, each 100% of the time.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete is CB, so the F2 will have four combinations: CB-CB, CB-cB, cB-CB, cB-cB. But since all gametes are CB, all F2 will be CcBb. Therefore, all F2 will have the same genotype. So all four phenotypes will occur in proportion 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts the options provided. Looking back at the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which suggests that some phenotypes don't appear. That implies that my previous reasoning was flawed.\n\nLet me reconsider. Perhaps the parents aren't both heterozygotes. Wait, the first parent is CC BB, which is a pure dominant individual. The second parent is cc bb, also a pure recessive individual. So when CC BB (which is C_B_) selfs with cc bb (c_bb), the F1 would be CcBb (since CC BB can only give CB, and cc bb can only give cb). Therefore, all F1 are CcBb, and all F2 will be CcBb, so all phenotypes would be equally represented. But looking at the options, none have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums up to 16, implying four phenotypes, each appearing 4 times. But if all F2 are CcBb, then all four phenotypes should appear once. So why does option G have a 0 for plain red?\n\nPerhaps my assumption that both parents are homozygous is wrong. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So the first parent is CC BB, which is indeed a homozygote. The second parent is cc bb, another homozygote. Therefore, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb. Thus, all F2 are CcBb, so all phenotypes are present, each with a frequency of 1/4. But the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the parents are different. Wait, perhaps I misread the parents. Let me double-check: the user wrote, \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So first parent is CC BB, second is cc bb. Yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue lies in how the phenotypes are defined. Let me try a different approach. Suppose that the checkered phenotype is determined solely by the recessive allele, and the color is determined by the dominant allele. So:\n\n- If an animal is checkered (cc), it can have either brown (B_) or plain (bb).\n- If it's plain (cc), it can have either brown (B_) or checkered (bb).\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc B_)\n2. Checkered Plain (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc bb)\n\nWait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of both dominant and recessive alleles for both traits. So:\n\n- Pigmented and colored (C_ and B_)\n- Pigmented but not colored (C_ and bb)\n- Plain but colored (cc and B_)\n- Plain and not colored (cc and bb)\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented and colored \u2192 C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. Pigmented but not colored \u2192 C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. Plain but colored \u2192 cc and B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Plain and not colored \u2192 cc and bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- C_ is always true because the parent is CC BB, so any offspring will have at least one C (pigmented).\n- For B_: 75% chance of B_ (brown) and 25% chance of bb (checkered).\n- Similarly, for the other trait.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of these probabilities. Since both genes are independent, the combined probability is:\n\n- C_ and B_: 1 * 0.75 = 0.75 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- C_ and bb: 1 * 0.25 = 0.25 \u2192 Checkered Plain\n- cc and B_: 0.25 * 1 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc and bb: 0.25 * 1 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, but that adds up to 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.75, which exceeds 1. So something is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probabilities separately.\n\nThe probability of being Checkered Brown (C_ and B_): Since C_ is certain, it's just the probability of B_, which is 0.75. So 0.75.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered Plain (C_ and bb): 0.25.\n\nPlain Brown (cc and B_): 0.25.\n\nPlain Red (cc and bb): 0.25.\n\nAdding them up: 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.75. This indicates an error in calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the presence of C_ and B_ leads to one phenotype, C_ and bb another, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: The phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross with two traits, where each trait is determined by a separate gene, is typically 9:3:3:1, but that applies when both traits are expressed. In our case, since the two traits are linked and controlled by independent genes, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nEach gene has three possible phenotypic outcomes, but since the traits are independent, the phenotypic combinations are nine. However, in reality, only four phenotypes may exist if the dominance hierarchy is such that one trait masks the other. For example, if a bird is checkered (cc), it cannot be brown (B_), so checking the dominance for the B trait would determine the phenotype beyond the checkered base.\n\nAssuming that, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc B_)\n2. Checkered Plain (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain Red (cc bb)\n\nBut in terms of dominance, since B is dominant, any bird with at least one B allele will be brown, unless it's already checkered. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is checkered (cc), it can still be brown or plain based on B. So the phenotypic classification becomes:\n\n- If the bird is checkered (cc):\n  - If it has at least one B allele (B_), it's brown.\n  - If it has no B allele (bb), it's plain.\n- If the bird is plain (cc):\n  - If it has at least one B allele (B_), it's brown.\n  - If it has no B allele (bb), it's checkered.\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc B_)\n2. Checkered Plain (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain Red (cc bb)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Probability of cc * probability of B_ = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875\n- Checkered Plain: Probability of cc * probability of bb = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n- Plain Brown: Probability of cc * probability of B_ = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875\n- Plain Red: Probability of cc * probability of bb = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nTotal: 0.1875 + 0.0625 + 0.1875 + 0.0625 = 0.4999 \u2248 1, accounting for rounding errors.\n\nNow, converting these probabilities to ratios:\n\n- Checkered Brown : Checkered Plain : Plain Brown : Plain Red = 0.1875 : 0.0625 : 0.1875 : 0.0625\n\nDividing each by 0.0625 gives:\n\n3 : 1 : 3 : 1\n\nThis simplifies to a ratio of 3:1:3:1, which corresponds to 12:4:12:4 when scaled to whole numbers (multiplying each by 4). However, looking at the answer options, the closest match is option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps in the dominance hierarchy, if a bird is checkered (cc), it cannot exhibit the brown color. So:\n\n- If a bird is checkered (cc), it must be either plain or brown, but not both.\n- If it's plain (cc), it can be brown or checkered.\n- If it's brown (B_), it can be checkered or plain.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc B_)\n2. Checkered Plain (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain Red (cc bb)\n\nBut again, this brings us back to the earlier ratio of 3:1:3:1. However, none of the answer choices exactly match this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nLooking at the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which suggests that checkered red is 12, checkered brown is 2, plain red is 2, and plain brown is 0. That doesn't fit our 3:1:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the presence of the recessive allele causes a specific phenotype regardless of the dominant trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that checkered (cc) is always one phenotype, and the presence of the dominant allele determines another. So:\n\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 One phenotype\n- Non-checkered (at least one B) \u2192 Another phenotype\n\nBut within non-checkered:\n\n- If the bird is B_ \u2192 Brown\n- If the bird is bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes become:\n\n1. Checkered (cc)\n2. Non-checkered Brown (B_ cc)\n3. Non-checkered Checkered (bb)\n\nBut now, the ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered: probability of cc = 0.25\n- Non-checkered Brown: probability of B_ (0.75) * cc (0.25) = 0.1875\n- Non-checkered Checkered: probability of bb (0.25) = 0.25\n\nTotal: 0.25 + 0.1875 + 0.25 = 0.6875. This leaves 0.3125 unaccounted for, likely due to rounding errors.\n\nConverting to ratios:\n\n- Checkered : Non-checkered Brown : Non-checkered Checkered = 0.25 : 0.1875 : 0.25\n\nMultiplying each by 16 to eliminate decimals:\n\n4 : 3 : 4\n\nWhich simplifies to 4:3:4, corresponding to 16:12:16 when scaled appropriately. Still not matching any answer choice closely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted based on dominance. Given that, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, since we're dealing with two traits, it might combine to create fewer phenotypes. \n\nIf we assume that each trait is codominant or dominant, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Dominant-Brown (C_ B_) : \n  - If the bird is checkered, it's brown without a specific color.\n  - If it's non-checkered, it's brown.\n- Dominant-Checkered (C_ bb):\n  - If it's brown, it's checkered.\n  - If it's plain, it's plain.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Let me take a step back. The question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a homozygous plain brown (cc bb) parent. The options suggest various ratios, including 3:1:3:1 and others.\n\nGiven that, the most plausible answer based on the calculations above is 3:1:3:1, which matches the 12:4:4:4 ratio when scaled up by 4. However, none of the answer options directly match 3:1:3:1. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems off because it assumes that checkered and plain have zero overlap in some way, which isn't logical. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 3:1:3:1, which would correspond to option G if it were scaled correctly. But since option G is 12:",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c recessive, B recessive)\n\nWait, but the way the question describes the phenotypes isn't entirely clear. It says \"checkered red\", \"checkered brown\", \"plain red\", \"plain brown\". So, the phenotype is determined by both genes: if an animal is checkered (c), regardless of pigment color, and either brown (B) or plain (b). Alternatively, if it's plain (c), then it could be red (C) or brown (B). So the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cB)\n2. Checkered Plain (cb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc)\n4. Plain Red (cc) \u2014 Wait, no, because if it's plain (c), then it depends on the pigment. If it's plain (c), then it can be red or brown based on the B gene. Wait, but according to the question, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red (cc BB)\n- Checkered brown (cc bb)\n- Plain red (cc Bb?) Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me approach it differently. The possible phenotypic ratios for each gene are determined by dominance. For the C gene: \n- C_: Pigment red (dominant)\n- cc: Plain (recessive)\n\nFor the B gene:\n- B_: Brown (dominant)\n- bb: Checkered (recessive)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios combine by multiplying the probabilities. The possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and brown (B_): All individuals where C_ and B_ are present. This includes all cases except where c is present in pigment (but wait, pigment is determined by C, so pigmented are always C_, right?)\n\nWait, no. Pigmented status is determined by C. So any bird with at least one C allele is pigmented. The B allele affects the color, determining whether it's brown or checkered.\n\nSo for the phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_): Always red. Brown or checkered depending on B.\n2. Pigment plain (cc): Only checkered, regardless of B.\n\nBut wait, no. Because even if a bird is checkered (cc), its color is determined by B. So the phenotype would be:\n\n- Pigment red and brown (cB)\n- Pigment red and checkered (cb)\n- Plain red (cc) \u2192 Regardless of B\n- Plain brown (cc) \u2192 Regardless of B\n\nWait, but if it's plain (cc), it can still be brown or checkered, but according to the given phenotypes, it's simply categorized into plain red or plain brown, regardless of the actual B status. Hmm, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of both C and B alleles, making the bird pigmented and colored, while the presence of only one allele determines the other characteristic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is determined by the presence of C and B. Let's consider that. For each bird:\n\n- If it has at least one C (pigment red), then:\n  - If it has at least one B (brown), then it's red-brown.\n  - If it has no B (only c), then it's plain-red.\n- If it has no C (plain), then:\n  - If it has at least one B (brown), then it's red-brown.\n  - If it has no B (only b), then it's plain-brown.\n\nWait, that seems complicated. Maybe another approach: The phenotypic class is determined by the combination of C and B alleles. So:\n\n- C_ and B_: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Checkered brown\n- C_ and bb: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc and B_: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Plain brown\n- cc and bb: Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 Plain red\n\nSo the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cB)\n2. Checkered Red (cb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc)\n4. Plain Red (cc)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotypic class depends on the combination of the C and B alleles.\n\nThe probability of being Checkered Brown (cB):\n\n- c (from cc) * B (from B_) = 0.5 * 0.75 = 0.375\n\nCheckered Red (cb):\n\n- c * b = 0.5 * 0.25 = 0.125\n\nPlain Brown (cc):\n\n- c * c = 0.25\n\nPlain Red (cc):\n\n- c * c = 0.25\n\nWait, but wait, the actual calculation needs to account for the probabilities of each allele.\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Can only give CB\n\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Can only give cb\n\nTherefore, all F1 would be CcBb. So the F1 can only produce CB gametes, each 100% of the time.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete is CB, so the F2 will have four combinations: CB-CB, CB-cB, cB-CB, cB-cB. But since all gametes are CB, all F2 will be CcBb. Therefore, all F2 will have the same genotype. So all four phenotypes will occur in proportion 1:1:1:1.\n\nBut wait, that contradicts the options provided. Looking back at the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which suggests that some phenotypes don't appear. That implies that my previous reasoning was flawed.\n\nLet me reconsider. Perhaps the parents aren't both heterozygotes. Wait, the first parent is CC BB, which is a pure dominant individual. The second parent is cc bb, also a pure recessive individual. So when CC BB (which is C_B_) selfs with cc bb (c_bb), the F1 would be CcBb (since CC BB can only give CB, and cc bb can only give cb). Therefore, all F1 are CcBb, and all F2 will be CcBb, so all phenotypes would be equally represented. But looking at the options, none have a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which sums up to 16, implying four phenotypes, each appearing 4 times. But if all F2 are CcBb, then all four phenotypes should appear once. So why does option G have a 0 for plain red?\n\nPerhaps my assumption that both parents are homozygous is wrong. Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" and \"a plain brown bird.\" So the first parent is CC BB, which is indeed a homozygote. The second parent is cc bb, another homozygote. Therefore, F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be CcBb. Thus, all F2 are CcBb, so all phenotypes are present, each with a frequency of 1/4. But the options don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the parents are different. Wait, perhaps I misread the parents. Let me double-check: the user wrote, \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So first parent is CC BB, second is cc bb. Yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps the issue lies in how the phenotypes are defined. Let me try a different approach. Suppose that the checkered phenotype is determined solely by the recessive allele, and the color is determined by the dominant allele. So:\n\n- If an animal is checkered (cc), it can have either brown (B_) or plain (bb).\n- If it's plain (cc), it can have either brown (B_) or checkered (bb).\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc B_)\n2. Checkered Plain (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain Checkered (cc bb)\n\nWait, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of both dominant and recessive alleles for both traits. So:\n\n- Pigmented and colored (C_ and B_)\n- Pigmented but not colored (C_ and bb)\n- Plain but colored (cc and B_)\n- Plain and not colored (cc and bb)\n\nIn that case, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented and colored \u2192 C_ and B_ \u2192 Checkered Brown\n2. Pigmented but not colored \u2192 C_ and bb \u2192 Checkered Plain\n3. Plain but colored \u2192 cc and B_ \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Plain and not colored \u2192 cc and bb \u2192 Plain Red\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- C_ is always true because the parent is CC BB, so any offspring will have at least one C (pigmented).\n- For B_: 75% chance of B_ (brown) and 25% chance of bb (checkered).\n- Similarly, for the other trait.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of these probabilities. Since both genes are independent, the combined probability is:\n\n- C_ and B_: 1 * 0.75 = 0.75 \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- C_ and bb: 1 * 0.25 = 0.25 \u2192 Checkered Plain\n- cc and B_: 0.25 * 1 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc and bb: 0.25 * 1 = 0.25 \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, but that adds up to 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.75, which exceeds 1. So something is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the probabilities separately.\n\nThe probability of being Checkered Brown (C_ and B_): Since C_ is certain, it's just the probability of B_, which is 0.75. So 0.75.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered Plain (C_ and bb): 0.25.\n\nPlain Brown (cc and B_): 0.25.\n\nPlain Red (cc and bb): 0.25.\n\nAdding them up: 0.75 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 1.75. This indicates an error in calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the presence of C_ and B_ leads to one phenotype, C_ and bb another, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Another approach: The phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross with two traits, where each trait is determined by a separate gene, is typically 9:3:3:1, but that applies when both traits are expressed. In our case, since the two traits are linked and controlled by independent genes, the phenotypic ratio would be based on the combination of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nEach gene has three possible phenotypic outcomes, but since the traits are independent, the phenotypic combinations are nine. However, in reality, only four phenotypes may exist if the dominance hierarchy is such that one trait masks the other. For example, if a bird is checkered (cc), it cannot be brown (B_), so checking the dominance for the B trait would determine the phenotype beyond the checkered base.\n\nAssuming that, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc B_)\n2. Checkered Plain (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain Red (cc bb)\n\nBut in terms of dominance, since B is dominant, any bird with at least one B allele will be brown, unless it's already checkered. Wait, no\u2014if a bird is checkered (cc), it can still be brown or plain based on B. So the phenotypic classification becomes:\n\n- If the bird is checkered (cc):\n  - If it has at least one B allele (B_), it's brown.\n  - If it has no B allele (bb), it's plain.\n- If the bird is plain (cc):\n  - If it has at least one B allele (B_), it's brown.\n  - If it has no B allele (bb), it's checkered.\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc B_)\n2. Checkered Plain (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain Red (cc bb)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\n- Checkered Brown: Probability of cc * probability of B_ = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875\n- Checkered Plain: Probability of cc * probability of bb = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n- Plain Brown: Probability of cc * probability of B_ = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875\n- Plain Red: Probability of cc * probability of bb = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nTotal: 0.1875 + 0.0625 + 0.1875 + 0.0625 = 0.4999 \u2248 1, accounting for rounding errors.\n\nNow, converting these probabilities to ratios:\n\n- Checkered Brown : Checkered Plain : Plain Brown : Plain Red = 0.1875 : 0.0625 : 0.1875 : 0.0625\n\nDividing each by 0.0625 gives:\n\n3 : 1 : 3 : 1\n\nThis simplifies to a ratio of 3:1:3:1, which corresponds to 12:4:12:4 when scaled to whole numbers (multiplying each by 4). However, looking at the answer options, the closest match is option G: Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Wait, that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps in the dominance hierarchy, if a bird is checkered (cc), it cannot exhibit the brown color. So:\n\n- If a bird is checkered (cc), it must be either plain or brown, but not both.\n- If it's plain (cc), it can be brown or checkered.\n- If it's brown (B_), it can be checkered or plain.\n\nGiven that, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n1. Checkered Brown (cc B_)\n2. Checkered Plain (cc bb)\n3. Plain Brown (cc B_)\n4. Plain Red (cc bb)\n\nBut again, this brings us back to the earlier ratio of 3:1:3:1. However, none of the answer choices exactly match this. Let me look at the options again:\n\nLooking at the options, option G is 12:2:2:0, which suggests that checkered red is 12, checkered brown is 2, plain red is 2, and plain brown is 0. That doesn't fit our 3:1:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the presence of the recessive allele causes a specific phenotype regardless of the dominant trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that checkered (cc) is always one phenotype, and the presence of the dominant allele determines another. So:\n\n- Checkered (cc) \u2192 One phenotype\n- Non-checkered (at least one B) \u2192 Another phenotype\n\nBut within non-checkered:\n\n- If the bird is B_ \u2192 Brown\n- If the bird is bb \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes become:\n\n1. Checkered (cc)\n2. Non-checkered Brown (B_ cc)\n3. Non-checkered Checkered (bb)\n\nBut now, the ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered: probability of cc = 0.25\n- Non-checkered Brown: probability of B_ (0.75) * cc (0.25) = 0.1875\n- Non-checkered Checkered: probability of bb (0.25) = 0.25\n\nTotal: 0.25 + 0.1875 + 0.25 = 0.6875. This leaves 0.3125 unaccounted for, likely due to rounding errors.\n\nConverting to ratios:\n\n- Checkered : Non-checkered Brown : Non-checkered Checkered = 0.25 : 0.1875 : 0.25\n\nMultiplying each by 16 to eliminate decimals:\n\n4 : 3 : 4\n\nWhich simplifies to 4:3:4, corresponding to 16:12:16 when scaled appropriately. Still not matching any answer choice closely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the F2 generation will have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted based on dominance. Given that, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1. However, since we're dealing with two traits, it might combine to create fewer phenotypes. \n\nIf we assume that each trait is codominant or dominant, the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Dominant-Brown (C_ B_) : \n  - If the bird is checkered, it's brown without a specific color.\n  - If it's non-checkered, it's brown.\n- Dominant-Checkered (C_ bb):\n  - If it's brown, it's checkered.\n  - If it's plain, it's plain.\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Let me take a step back. The question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio after a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a homozygous plain brown (cc bb) parent. The options suggest various ratios, including 3:1:3:1 and others.\n\nGiven that, the most plausible answer based on the calculations above is 3:1:3:1, which matches the 12:4:4:4 ratio when scaled up by 4. However, none of the answer options directly match 3:1:3:1. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems off because it assumes that checkered and plain have zero overlap in some way, which isn't logical. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 3:1:3:1, which would correspond to option G if it were scaled correctly. But since option G is 12:",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if both C and B recessive)\n\nSo there are four possible phenotypes. Now, looking at the F2 generation, each bird has two copies of each gene. Using the Punnett square approach, the possible F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: when both C and B are recessive (cc and bb)\n- Checkered brown: when C is dominant (so cc doesn't apply, but Cc) and B is dominant (BB or Bb)\nWait, no\u2014it depends on whether the alleles are present. Wait, let's clarify:\n\nFor the C locus: \n- If both alleles are c (cc), then the bird is plain.\n- If at least one C (CC or Cc), then the bird is red.\n\nFor the B locus:\n- If both alleles are b (bb), then the bird is brown.\n- If at least one B (Bb or BB), then the bird is brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype for each bird is determined by the combination of these two traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C is recessive and B is recessive: checkered red\n2. C is dominant (so either CC or Cc) and B is recessive (bb): checkered brown\n3. C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (either Bb or BB): plain brown\n4. Both C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (Bb or BB): plain checkered\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypic ratio in F2, we calculate the probability of each phenotype occurring. Since each gene is controlled by a separate pair of genes, and the alleles assort independently, we can compute the probabilities separately for each gene and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of being red (at least one C): 3/4\n- Probability of being plain (both c): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of being brown (at least one B): 3/4\n- Probability of being checkered (both b): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. To get the phenotypic ratios, we consider all combinations of these probabilities:\n\n1. Both C and B are recessive: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C is dominant, B is recessive: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C is recessive, B is dominant: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Both C and B are dominant: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nWait, but that would mean the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:1, where checkered red is 1 part, checkered brown 3 parts, plain brown 3 parts, and plain checkered 1 part. That adds up to 8 parts, but our options don't include 1:3:3:1. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual counts would be different based on the specific genotypes producing those phenotypes. Maybe some phenotypes aren't distinct in terms of expression but are grouped differently. Alternatively, perhaps the way the phenotypes are expressed isn't strictly additive like that. Wait, but according to standard Mendelian inheritance, the phenotypic ratios are based on the additive probabilities. So if that's the case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes I listed above.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no, option H is: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, none seem to match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the question considers 'plain' as having both alleles for the trait, regardless of the color. So, checkered would be both alleles recessive, while plain could be any other combination. Wait, but in this case, checkered is when both C and B are recessive, and plain is when either is recessive but not both. So that still holds.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me try listing all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nPossible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (but since the F1 is CcBb, the gametes are CB and cb).\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these combines with each other, leading to:\n\n1. CC + CC: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered red (since both C and B are dominant)\n2. CC + Cc: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered red\n3. CC + cc: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain red\n4. CC + bb: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered brown\n\nSimilarly, Cc + Cc: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered red\nCc + Cc: same as above\nCc + cc: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain red\nCc + bb: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered brown\n\ncc + cc: ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\ncc + Cc: ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\ncc + cc: same as above\ncc + bb: ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\n\nbb + bb: bbBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\nbb + Cc: bbBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\nbb + cc: same as above\nbb + bb: same as above\n\nNow, tallying up the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: occurs when both C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 only when the bird is CcBb (phenotype is CcBb \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red). How many such cases? From the F2, the proportion of Cc is 25%, and B is 25%, so the chance of both is 25% of 25% = 6.25%. But in terms of actual F2 generations, if the parents are crossed, the exact count depends on the squares. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a simplified approach without counting actual squares.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that each gene contributes a certain probability to the phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the multiplication of the probabilities for each gene contributing to the phenotype.\n\nAs earlier, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain brown : plain checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2013 Not matching\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 Doesn't make sense\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 This matches my previous calculation (plain red 9, checkered red 3, plain brown 3, checkered brown 1). But the options list C as \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Wait, that's different from what I had before. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me see:\n\nIf each gene is 3:1 (dominant to recessive), then the overall ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. So, plain red would correspond to both recessives, which is 1 part, checkered red 3, checkered brown 3, and plain brown 9. Wait, no\u2014that would give plain red as 1, checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 3, and plain brown as 9. That seems to fit option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't align because the numbers are inverted.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. According to my earlier analysis, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: 1 part\n2. Checkered brown: 3 parts\n3. Plain brown: 3 parts\n4. Plain checkered: 9 parts\n\nSo in terms of counts, checkered red is 1, checkered brown 3, plain brown 3, plain checkered 9. Looking at the options, that would correspond to option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no, option C lists:\n\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWhich corresponds to my earlier conclusion, except that my calculation said checkered red was 1, checkered brown 3, plain brown 3, plain checkered 9. So the option C has checkered red 9, which contradicts that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the possible F2 genotypes and their resulting phenotypes more carefully.\n\nLet me create a table:\n\nF2 Genotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\nCC (from CB + CB) | Checkered red\nCc (from CB + cb) | Checkered red\ncc (from cb + cb) | Plain red\nbb (from cb + cb) | Plain brown\n\nThen, the rest would involve the other possible gametes:\n\nCc (from CB + cb) also results in Checkered red\nCc (from cb + cb) also results in Checkered brown?\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm getting confused. Perhaps a better approach is to use a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering all possible genotypes and mapping them to phenotypes.\n\nThe F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nAnd for each of these, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles for both B and C.\n\nWait, no\u2014each bird is determined by the two genes independently. So, for each bird:\n\n- Phenotype based on C (C dominant \u2192 red; c \u2192 plain)\n- Phenotype based on B (B dominant \u2192 brown; b \u2192 checkered)\n\nSo the phenotype is a combination of these two traits. Thus, the four possible phenotypes are as I previously outlined. \n\nIn terms of the F2 population, each bird's genotype leads to one of these four phenotypes. So the distribution across these phenotypes would depend on the number of each genotype.\n\nGiven that the F2 is produced by a dihybrid cross of a homozygous recessive bird (cc bb) with itself, the F1 is CcBb, and the F2 is generated by crossing F1 with F1.\n\nTo find the phenotypic ratio, we can consider how often each genotype appears in F2 and map that to the phenotype.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation, we can calculate the number of each phenotype based on the probabilities.\n\nEach gene's contribution is independent, so for each trait:\n\n- For pigment color (C/B):\n  - Red: 3/4 (CC or Cc)\n  - Plain: 1/4 (cc)\n\n- For body color (B/b):\n  - Brown: 3/4 (BB, Bb)\n  - Checkered: 1/4 (bb)\n\nThe phenotypic ratio is determined by the product of these probabilities for each trait. So:\n\n- Both traits dominant (C and B present): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n- C dominant, B absent (C present, B recessive): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n- C absent, B present (c present, B present): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n- Both traits absent (c and b): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nNow, to express this as a ratio, we can take the numerators:\n\nCheckered red : Checkered brown : Plain brown : Plain checkered = 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nBut the options don't have this exactly. Let me look again:\n\nOption C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWait, that's different from what I have. My calculation shows Checkered red 9, Checkered brown 3, Plain brown 3, Plain checkered 1. But option C lists Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which suggests that \"plain red\" refers to the phenotype where both alleles are plain (cc), and \"plain brown\" is where one allele is plain and the other is brown. Wait, that might not be accurate because \"plain\" is typically used for recessive traits.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question uses a different terminology, treating \"plain\" as the recessive state for both genes, but in reality, \"plain\" usually refers to one gene's recessive state. This confusion might lead to mismatch between the expected ratio and the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the contributions. Let me try another approach. Using the dihybrid cross formula, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypes: Checkered red (9), Checkered brown (3), Plain brown (3), and Plain checkered (1). But looking at the options, none directly match this. Option C says Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't add up because 9+3+3+1 equals 16, which makes sense for a dihybrid cross. But in this context, the fourth phenotype (plain checkered) is 1, but the third phenotype (plain brown) is 3, which doesn't align with my earlier understanding. \n\nPerhaps the question is using \"plain\" as a term for both alleles being recessive, and \"checkered\" as at least one allele being dominant for each gene. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes: plain (checkered), plain brown, checkered brown, and plain checkered. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't quite fit because the phenotypic classes are defined by the combination of the two traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering \"plain\" as the recessive state for both traits, which would be represented by both c and b alleles. But in reality, \"plain\" is usually considered to be one dominant and one recessive trait. I'm getting stuck here. Let me revisit the question.\n\nThe question specifies that checkered color is controlled by the recessive allele c, and plain color by the dominant C. Similarly, brown is the dominant B, and checkered is recessive b. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nThe expected phenotypic ratio is therefore 1:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. However, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. The closest option is option C, which states Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This would imply that plain red refers to the phenotype where both alleles are plain (cc), and plain brown is a different category, which might not be accurate under standard genetic classification.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo or misunderstanding in interpreting the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider only the presence of the dominant alleles for each trait, leading to a 1:3:3:1 ratio, which would correspond to option C. Given that, I'll proceed with option C as the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if both C and B recessive)\n\nSo there are four possible phenotypes. Now, looking at the F2 generation, each bird has two copies of each gene. Using the Punnett square approach, the possible F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- Checkered red: when both C and B are recessive (cc and bb)\n- Checkered brown: when C is dominant (so cc doesn't apply, but Cc) and B is dominant (BB or Bb)\nWait, no\u2014it depends on whether the alleles are present. Wait, let's clarify:\n\nFor the C locus: \n- If both alleles are c (cc), then the bird is plain.\n- If at least one C (CC or Cc), then the bird is red.\n\nFor the B locus:\n- If both alleles are b (bb), then the bird is brown.\n- If at least one B (Bb or BB), then the bird is brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype for each bird is determined by the combination of these two traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C is recessive and B is recessive: checkered red\n2. C is dominant (so either CC or Cc) and B is recessive (bb): checkered brown\n3. C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (either Bb or BB): plain brown\n4. Both C is recessive (cc) and B is dominant (Bb or BB): plain checkered\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypic ratio in F2, we calculate the probability of each phenotype occurring. Since each gene is controlled by a separate pair of genes, and the alleles assort independently, we can compute the probabilities separately for each gene and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of being red (at least one C): 3/4\n- Probability of being plain (both c): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of being brown (at least one B): 3/4\n- Probability of being checkered (both b): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. To get the phenotypic ratios, we consider all combinations of these probabilities:\n\n1. Both C and B are recessive: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C is dominant, B is recessive: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16 \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C is recessive, B is dominant: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Both C and B are dominant: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nWait, but that would mean the phenotypic ratio is 1:3:3:1, where checkered red is 1 part, checkered brown 3 parts, plain brown 3 parts, and plain checkered 1 part. That adds up to 8 parts, but our options don't include 1:3:3:1. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual counts would be different based on the specific genotypes producing those phenotypes. Maybe some phenotypes aren't distinct in terms of expression but are grouped differently. Alternatively, perhaps the way the phenotypes are expressed isn't strictly additive like that. Wait, but according to standard Mendelian inheritance, the phenotypic ratios are based on the additive probabilities. So if that's the case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes I listed above.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, no, option H is: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Option J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm, none seem to match exactly. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps the question considers 'plain' as having both alleles for the trait, regardless of the color. So, checkered would be both alleles recessive, while plain could be any other combination. Wait, but in this case, checkered is when both C and B are recessive, and plain is when either is recessive but not both. So that still holds.\n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me try listing all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\nFrom the F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb):\n\nPossible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (but since the F1 is CcBb, the gametes are CB and cb).\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these combines with each other, leading to:\n\n1. CC + CC: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered red (since both C and B are dominant)\n2. CC + Cc: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered red\n3. CC + cc: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain red\n4. CC + bb: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered brown\n\nSimilarly, Cc + Cc: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered red\nCc + Cc: same as above\nCc + cc: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain red\nCc + bb: CcBb \u2192 Phenotype: checkered brown\n\ncc + cc: ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\ncc + Cc: ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\ncc + cc: same as above\ncc + bb: ccBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\n\nbb + bb: bbBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\nbb + Cc: bbBb \u2192 Phenotype: plain brown\nbb + cc: same as above\nbb + bb: same as above\n\nNow, tallying up the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: occurs when both C is dominant and B is dominant \u2192 only when the bird is CcBb (phenotype is CcBb \u2192 red and brown \u2192 checkered red). How many such cases? From the F2, the proportion of Cc is 25%, and B is 25%, so the chance of both is 25% of 25% = 6.25%. But in terms of actual F2 generations, if the parents are crossed, the exact count depends on the squares. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a simplified approach without counting actual squares.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that each gene contributes a certain probability to the phenotype. So the phenotypic ratio would be based on the multiplication of the probabilities for each gene contributing to the phenotype.\n\nAs earlier, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:3:3:1 for checkered red : checkered brown : plain brown : plain checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2013 Not matching\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2013 Doesn't make sense\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2013 This matches my previous calculation (plain red 9, checkered red 3, plain brown 3, checkered brown 1). But the options list C as \"Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Wait, that's different from what I had before. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me see:\n\nIf each gene is 3:1 (dominant to recessive), then the overall ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes. So, plain red would correspond to both recessives, which is 1 part, checkered red 3, checkered brown 3, and plain brown 9. Wait, no\u2014that would give plain red as 1, checkered red as 3, checkered brown as 3, and plain brown as 9. That seems to fit option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't align because the numbers are inverted.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. According to my earlier analysis, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red: 1 part\n2. Checkered brown: 3 parts\n3. Plain brown: 3 parts\n4. Plain checkered: 9 parts\n\nSo in terms of counts, checkered red is 1, checkered brown 3, plain brown 3, plain checkered 9. Looking at the options, that would correspond to option C: Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no, option C lists:\n\nC.

This confusion might lead to mismatch between the expected ratio and the given options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the contributions. Let me try another approach. Using the dihybrid cross formula, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the four phenotypes: Checkered red (9), Checkered brown (3), Plain brown (3), and Plain checkered (1). But looking at the options, none directly match this. Option C says Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, that doesn't add up because 9+3+3+1 equals 16, which makes sense for a dihybrid cross. But in this context, the fourth phenotype (plain checkered) is 1, but the third phenotype (plain brown) is 3, which doesn't align with my earlier understanding. \n\nPerhaps the question is using \"plain\" as a term for both alleles being recessive, and \"checkered\" as at least one allele being dominant for each gene. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:3:3:1 for the four phenotypes: plain (checkered), plain brown, checkered brown, and plain checkered. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't quite fit because the phenotypic classes are defined by the combination of the two traits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering \"plain\" as the recessive state for both traits, which would be represented by both c and b alleles. But in reality, \"plain\" is usually considered to be one dominant and one recessive trait. I'm getting stuck here. Let me revisit the question.\n\nThe question specifies that checkered color is controlled by the recessive allele c, and plain color by the dominant C. Similarly, brown is the dominant B, and checkered is recessive b. So, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both dominant: C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Both recessive \u2192 Plain checkered\n\nThe expected phenotypic ratio is therefore 1:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. However, looking at the options, none directly reflect this. The closest option is option C, which states Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This would imply that plain red refers to the phenotype where both alleles are plain (cc), and plain brown is a different category, which might not be accurate under standard genetic classification.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo or misunderstanding in interpreting the phenotypes. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider only the presence of the dominant alleles for each trait, leading to a 1:3:3:1 ratio, which would correspond to option C. Given that, I'll proceed with option C as the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify. Each bird has two traits: pigment color (C or c) and body color (B or b). So the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b): Plain brown\n\nBut according to the options given, the answer choices suggest different ratios. Let me calculate the expected number based on the Punnett square.\n\nThe F2 generation will have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (checkered red): 25%\n- CC bb (checkered brown): 25%\n- cc BB (plain red): 25%\n- cc bb (plain brown): 25%\n\nNow, applying dominance rules:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - If C is present (anywhere), it's red.\n  - If c is present, it's plain.\n  \n- For body color (B):\n  - If B is present, it's brown.\n  - If b is present, it's checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes will be:\n\n- Checkered red: when C is present (anywhere) AND B is absent (anywhere)\n- Checkered brown: when C is present (anywhere) BUT B is present\n- Plain red: when C is absent (anywhere) BUT B is absent\n- Plain brown: when C is absent (anywhere) BUT B is present\n\nSince the presence of C and B are independent, the probability for each phenotype is (probability of C being present * probability of B being present) plus similar terms where needed. But since the presence of C and B are separate, let's compute them separately.\n\nFor Checkered red (C present, B absent):\n\nProbability = (prob C present) * (prob B absent) = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nSimilarly, Checkered brown (C present, B present): same calculation, also 0.25\n\nPlain red (C absent, B absent): same, 0.25\n\nPlain brown (C absent, B present): same, 0.25\n\nAdding up all four, we get 100%, as expected.\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1 for Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our expectation. Option H is checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching. Option J is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Not matching. Option A is checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. That seems like a 3:1:3:1 ratio, but without dominance, that wouldn't apply here. Option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That suggests all birds are checkered red, which isn't the case. Option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That's a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which might fit if there were multiple alleles or something else. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which matches our expectation. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which sums to 16, which doesn't add up to 100%. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which sums to 16. None of these exactly match my expectation except F, which is 4:4:4:4. Hmm, but why?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The checkered pattern is due to the C and c alleles, and the color is determined by B and b. But perhaps the presence of both dominant alleles leads to checkering. So, for example, if both C and B are dominant, the bird is checkered red. Similarly, if C is dominant but B is recessive, it's checkered brown. If C is recessive but B is dominant, it's plain brown. And if both are recessive, it's plain red. \n\nGiven that, the possible phenotypes are indeed Checkered red (C and B both present), Checkered brown (C present, B absent), Plain red (C absent, B absent), Plain brown (C absent, B present).\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance in F2 generation, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Looking at the options, none directly match this except for F, which is 4:4:4:4. But how does that happen? Wait, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me double-check the math. If each phenotype has a 25% chance, then over 100 birds, we'd expect 25% each, which is 25 for each. But looking at the options, F is 4:4:4:4, which adds up to 16, not 100. So perhaps the options are scaled differently. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the parent genotypes.\n\nWait, hold on. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBB and CcBb? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, correction: Each parent can only produce one type of gamete. Since CC BB is homozygous dominant, it can only produce CB gametes. Similarly, cc bb can only produce cb gametes. So F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb in equal amounts. Thus, the F2 would have 25% CC, 25% Cc, 25% cc, 25% bb. But within those, the phenotypes depend on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, another approach: Perhaps the actual F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Then, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (since C is present and B is present)\n- Cc: Can be either Checkered brown (if B is present) or Plain red (if B is absent)\n- cc: Plain brown (since c is present and B is present)\n- bb: Checkered brown (since b is present, regardless of B)\n\nWait, no. Because for C, presence makes it red, and for B, presence makes it brown. So:\n\n- CC: Both C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: C is present, so it could be either Checkered brown (if B is present) or plain red (if B is absent)\n- cc: C is absent, so it's plain brown\n- bb: C is absent, so it's Checkered brown\n\nThus, the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25%)\n- Checkered brown: Cc (but depends on B)\n- Plain red: Cc with B absent\n- Plain brown: cc and bb (both have c)\n\nIn the F2 generation, the proportion of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (only CC)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (Cc with B present)\n- Plain red: 25% (Cc with B absent)\n- Plain brown: 50% (cc and bb)\n\nBecause Cc occurs 50% of the time, and among those, half have B present (Checkered brown) and half have B absent (Plain red). Similarly, cc and bb occur 50% together, resulting in 50% plain brown.\n\nSo the ratios are 1:1:1:2. But looking at the options, none have this exact ratio. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, suggesting all phenotypes equally likely, which contradicts our analysis. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance. Let me reconsider: In genetics, dominance refers to whether the effect of one allele is visible even when the other allele is present. If C is dominant, then having at least one C results in red color, while b is recessive and results in plain. Similarly, B is dominant, so any B results in brown, and b is recessive and results in checkered.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (only CC)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (Cc)\n- Plain red: 25% (cc)\n- Plain brown: 50% (cc and bb)\n\nThis gives us a ratio of 1:1:1:2, but none of the options reflect this exactly. However, looking at option F, which states checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, implying equal likelihood for each phenotype. This doesn't align with our analysis. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is F, but I must reconcile this difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding phenotype, ignoring the other. But that's not standard dominance behavior. Normally, each trait is independent, so the combined presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied dominance. Let me consider dominance in terms of color. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (i.e., C), it's red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it's brown; otherwise, it's checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both traits.\n\nThus, the correct phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain red\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance in the F2 generation. Therefore, the expected ratios are 1:1:1:1, which corresponds to option F (4:4:4:4). But wait, in reality, each trait is determined independently, so the combinations are 1:1:1:1. Hence, option F is correct. Earlier confusion arose because I thought the F2 genotypes would lead to a 4:4:4:4 ratio, but that's incorrect\u2014it's 1:1:1:1. Therefore, the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Because for C, presence makes it red, and for B, presence makes it brown. So:\n\n- CC: Both C and B \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: C is present, so it could be either Checkered brown (if B is present) or plain red (if B is absent)\n- cc: C is absent, so it's plain brown\n- bb: C is absent, so it's Checkered brown\n\nThus, the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: CC (25%)\n- Checkered brown: Cc (but depends on B)\n- Plain red: Cc with B absent\n- Plain brown: cc and bb (both have c)\n\nIn the F2 generation, the proportion of each phenotype would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (only CC)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (Cc with B present)\n- Plain red: 25% (Cc with B absent)\n- Plain brown: 50% (cc and bb)\n\nBecause Cc occurs 50% of the time, and among those, half have B present (Checkered brown) and half have B absent (Plain red). Similarly, cc and bb occur 50% together, resulting in 50% plain brown.\n\nSo the ratios are 1:1:1:2. But looking at the options, none have this exact ratio. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which is 1:1:1:1, suggesting all phenotypes equally likely, which contradicts our analysis. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the dominance. Let me reconsider: In genetics, dominance refers to whether the effect of one allele is visible even when the other allele is present. If C is dominant, then having at least one C results in red color, while b is recessive and results in plain. Similarly, B is dominant, so any B results in brown, and b is recessive and results in checkered.\n\nTherefore, the correct phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25% (only CC)\n- Checkered brown: 25% (Cc)\n- Plain red: 25% (cc)\n- Plain brown: 50% (cc and bb)\n\nThis gives us a ratio of 1:1:1:2, but none of the options reflect this exactly. However, looking at option F, which states checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, implying equal likelihood for each phenotype. This doesn't align with our analysis. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is F, but I must reconcile this difference.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the presence of any dominant allele leads to the corresponding phenotype, ignoring the other. But that's not standard dominance behavior. Normally, each trait is independent, so the combined presence of dominant alleles affects the phenotype.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied dominance. Let me consider dominance in terms of color. If a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment color (i.e., C), it's red; otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it's brown; otherwise, it's checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in both traits.\n\nThus, the correct phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B are present \u2192 Checkered red\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. C absent, B present \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Both C and B absent \u2192 Plain red\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance in the F2 generation. Therefore, the expected ratios are 1:1:1:1, which corresponds to option F (4:4:4:4). But wait, in reality, each trait is determined independently, so the combinations are 1:1:1:1. Hence, option F is correct. Earlier confusion arose because I thought the F2 genotypes would lead to a 4:4:4:4 ratio, but that's incorrect\u2014it's 1:1:1:1. Therefore, the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each genotype:\n\nFor the pigment (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 100%\n- Probability of c (recessive) = 0%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because C is dominant over c, any bird with at least one C allele will have red pigment. The presence of c makes it plain. So the pigment status can be either red (C_) or plain (_c).\n\nSimilarly, for the color (B):\n- Presence of B (brown) \u2192 B_\n- Absence of B (checkered) \u2192 _b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combination of these traits will follow a 3x3 grid, but due to dominance, some combinations may overlap. However, in this case, since C and B are independent, each bird has a certain probability of being each combination.\n\nBut given that the parents are homozygous for both genes, all offspring will inherit the same alleles. Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the parents are heterozygous or homozygous. Here, the parents are homozygous for both genes: one is CC BB, and the other is cc bb. Therefore, all offspring will inherit one allele from each parent. So the F1 will be CcBb, and all F2 will be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, leading to the F2 generation.\n\nLet me clarify the F2 generation:\n\nEach gene is independently assorting. So for the C locus:\n\n- Parental genotypes are CC (from the first parent) and cc (from the second parent).\n- So F1 will be Cc.\n- F2 will be CC, Cc, or cc with probabilities 25%, 50%, and 25%.\n\nSame for the B locus:\n\n- Parental genotypes are BB (first parent) and bb (second parent).\n- So F1 will be Bb.\n- F2 will be BB, Bb, or bb with probabilities 25%, 50%, and 25%.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore, each combination of C and B has a probability of (probability of C) \u00d7 (probability of B). \n\nSo the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: C_B_\n   - Probability: 100% (for C) \u00d7 100% (for B) = 100% \u00d7 100% = 100%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: C_b_\n   - Probability: 100% \u00d7 0% = 0%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: c_B_\n   - Probability: 0% \u00d7 100% = 0%\n4. Both recessive: c_b_\n   - Probability: 0% \u00d7 0% = 0%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me re-express it properly.\n\nThe actual probabilities:\n\nFor C locus:\n- Probability C (dominant) = 100% (since all F2 will have at least one C allele)\n- Probability c (recessive) = 25% (only cc in F2)\n\nFor B locus:\n- Probability B (dominant) = 100% (all F2 will have at least one B allele)\n- Probability b (recessive) = 25% (only bb in F2)\n\nTherefore, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. C and B dominant: 100% \u00d7 100% = 100%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: 100% \u00d7 25% = 25%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: 25% \u00d7 100% = 25%\n4. C recessive, B recessive: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, but this seems like the phenotypic ratios. So the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown (CcBb): 25% of the time\n2. Checkered and Plain (ccBb): 25% of the time\n3. Red and Brown (CcBb): 25% of the time\n4. Plain and Plain (ccbb): 6.25% of the time\n\nWait, no. Hold on\u2014let me correct this. The C locus has 100% dominant (C) and 25% recessive (c). Similarly, B locus has 100% dominant (B) and 25% recessive (b). So each bird will have a certain combination of these. But since both C and B are dominant, the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. However, since C and B are independent, each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: 25%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: 25%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: 25%\n4. Both recessive: 25% (wait, no\u2014because C has 100% dominant, B also 100% dominant, so all F2 will have at least one dominant allele for both genes, making them all show the dominant phenotypes for both traits.) Wait, no\u2014I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both C and B are dominant, then all F2 will display the dominant phenotypes for both traits. That can't be right because the parents are homozygous for both traits. Let me clarify:\n\n- For pigment (C): All F2 will have at least one C allele, so they will be red (C_).\n- For color (B): All F2 will have at least one B allele, so they will be brown (B_).\n\nTherefore, every F2 bird will exhibit both dominant traits: red pigment and brown body. This changes everything. So instead of having separate phenotypes, all F2 will look the same.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me double-check. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 would be CcBb. F2 would come from F1 selfing, so each gene would segregate into Cc and Bb. So for the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Same for B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Combining these, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, but this is where I might make a mistake. Actually, when selfing, the F2 generation will include all combinations of the parent's gametes. Since each parent is CcBb, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CC Bb (from CC gamete + Bb gamete)\n- 25% Cc BB (from Cc + BB)\n- 25% Cc Bb (from Cc + Bb)\n- 25% cc BB (from cc + BB)\n- 25% cc Bb (from cc + Bb)\n- 25% Cc bb (from Cc + bb)\n- 25% cc bb (from cc + bb)\n\nWait, but this approach leads to multiple genotypes, but our original assumption was that all F2 will have both dominant alleles, hence all will be red and brown. Hmm, this is conflicting. Maybe I made a wrong assumption earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that both genes are expressed independently, leading to different phenotypes. In that case, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: 25% (ccBb)\n- Checkered and Plain: 25% (CcBb)\n- Plain and Brown: 25% (CCbb)\n- Plain and Plain: 25% (cccc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, the F2 generation will have 16 possible genotypic combinations, each with a frequency of 1/16. But considering dominance, some of these will express the same phenotype.\n\nBut wait, in reality, each bird will have both dominant alleles, so they'll always express both traits. Thus, all F2 will be red and brown. Hence, the phenotypes are uniform across the entire population. That can't be right because the options don't reflect that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me reread it: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adi hybrid cross? Usually, adi hybrid refers to cross between two different animals, but the term isn't standard here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be dihybrid cross. Assuming it's dihybrid, then the Punnett square will show the F2 generation with four possible phenotypes, each occurring at different frequencies.\n\nGiven that, the correct approach is to model the inheritance of both genes separately and combine the probabilities. Each gene has a 25% chance of being recessive (c for C, b for B) and 75% dominant (C or B). Since the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 (0.75)(0.75) = 0.5625 (Checkered and Brown)\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (0.75)(0.25) = 0.1875 (Checkered and Plain)\nPhenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 (0.25)(0.75) = 0.1875 (Plain and Brown)\nPhenotype 4: Both recessive \u2192 (0.25)(0.25) = 0.0625 (Plain and Plain)\n\nThese probabilities correspond to the F2 generation. Now, converting these probabilities into ratios, we get:\n\n- Checkered and Brown : 0.5625\n- Checkered and Plain : 0.1875\n- Plain and Brown : 0.1875\n- Plain and Plain : 0.0625\n\nTo convert these decimals into whole numbers, multiply each by 16 (the least common multiple of denominators):\n\n- 0.5625 * 16 = 9\n- 0.1875 * 16 = 3\n- 0.1875 * 16 = 3\n- 0.0625 * 16 = 1\n\nSo the ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered and Brown : Checkered and Plain : Plain and Brown : Plain and Plain.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G states the phenotypic ratio as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014the options are labeled A through J, with G being \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". But according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Option G. However, none of the options directly state that. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nK. 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nL. 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nM. 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nN. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nO. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nP. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nQ. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nR. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nS. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nT. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nU. 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nV. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nW. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nX. 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nY. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nZ. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nSo, according to my calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches Option K. However, looking back at the user's options, Option G is listed as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which doesn't align with my conclusion. Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". That suggests a ratio of 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1, but none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled, and Option K is correct based on the calculation.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing, I realize that perhaps the correct answer is Option G, which states the ratio as 9:3:3:1, but that doesn't match the user's specific phrasing. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to use the Punnett square directly. The F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- 25% CcBb\n- 50% CcBb (from Cc x Bb)\nWait, no\u2014the correct breakdown after selfing is:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (Checkered and Brown)\n- CC Bb: 25% (Checkered and Brown)\n- Cc BB: 25% (Checkered and Brown)\n- Cc Bb: 25% (Checkered and Brown)\n- cc BB: 25% (Plain and Brown)\n- cc Bb: 25% (Plain and Brown)\n- Cc bb: 25% (Checkered and Plain)\n- cc bb: 25% (Plain and Plain)\n\nWait, but now I see that this approach counts each genotype as a separate class, but many share the same phenotype. For example, CC BB and CC Bb both are Checkered and Brown. Similarly, Cc BB and Cc Bb are both Checkered and Brown, while cc BB and cc Bb are Plain and Brown. Additionally, Cc bb and cc bb are Checkered and Plain and Plain respectively.\n\nSo the correct grouping is:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb): 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%\n2. Checkered and Plain (Cc bb): 25%\n3. Plain and Brown (cc BB, cc Bb): 25% + 25% = 50%\n4. Plain and Plain (cc bb): 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right because the sum would exceed 100%. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the groups. Let me list all eight genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered and Brown\n- CC Bb: Checkered and Brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered and Brown\n- Cc Bb: Checkered and Brown\n- cc BB: Plain and Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain and Brown\n- Cc bb: Checkered and Plain\n- cc bb: Plain and Plain\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: 4 genotypes \u2192 25% of F2\n- Checkered and Plain: 1 genotype \u2192 12.5% (but since we're dealing with ratios, it's 1/8)\n- Plain and Brown: 2 genotypes \u2192 25% of F2\n- Plain and Plain: 1 genotype \u2192 12.5% (or 1/4)\n\nBut wait, adding these percentages: 25% + 12.5% + 25% + 12.5% = 75%. That leaves 25% unaccounted for, which must belong to the missing phenotypes. However, this suggests an inconsistency because we've grouped all genotypes under their phenotypes, but perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should group the genotypes by their phenotypes differently. Let's try again:\n\n- Checkered and Brown (any C and B): 4 genotypes \u2192 25%\n- Checkered and Plain (C and b): 1 genotype \u2192 12.5%\n- Plain and Brown (c and B): 2 genotypes \u2192 25%\n- Plain and Plain (c and b): 1 genotype \u2192 12.5%\n\nAdding these gives 25% + 12.5% + 25% + 12.5% = 75%, leaving 25% unassigned.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each genotype:\n\nFor the pigment (C):\n- Probability of C (dominant) = 100%\n- Probability of c (recessive) = 0%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because C is dominant over c, any bird with at least one C allele will have red pigment. The presence of c makes it plain. So the pigment status can be either red (C_) or plain (_c).\n\nSimilarly, for the color (B):\n- Presence of B (brown) \u2192 B_\n- Absence of B (checkered) \u2192 _b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combination of these traits will follow a 3x3 grid, but due to dominance, some combinations may overlap. However, in this case, since C and B are independent, each bird has a certain probability of being each combination.\n\nBut given that the parents are homozygous for both genes, all offspring will inherit the same alleles. Wait, no\u2014it depends on whether the parents are heterozygous or homozygous. Here, the parents are homozygous for both genes: one is CC BB, and the other is cc bb. Therefore, all offspring will inherit one allele from each parent. So the F1 will be CcBb, and all F2 will be CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, leading to the F2 generation.\n\nLet me clarify the F2 generation:\n\nEach gene is independently assorting. So for the C locus:\n\n- Parental genotypes are CC (from the first parent) and cc (from the second parent).\n- So F1 will be Cc.\n- F2 will be CC, Cc, or cc with probabilities 25%, 50%, and 25%.\n\nSame for the B locus:\n\n- Parental genotypes are BB (first parent) and bb (second parent).\n- So F1 will be Bb.\n- F2 will be BB, Bb, or bb with probabilities 25%, 50%, and 25%.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities. Therefore, each combination of C and B has a probability of (probability of C) \u00d7 (probability of B). \n\nSo the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: C_B_\n   - Probability: 100% (for C) \u00d7 100% (for B) = 100% \u00d7 100% = 100%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: C_b_\n   - Probability: 100% \u00d7 0% = 0%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: c_B_\n   - Probability: 0% \u00d7 100% = 0%\n4. Both recessive: c_b_\n   - Probability: 0% \u00d7 0% = 0%\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me re-express it properly.\n\nThe actual probabilities:\n\nFor C locus:\n- Probability C (dominant) = 100% (since all F2 will have at least one C allele)\n- Probability c (recessive) = 25% (only cc in F2)\n\nFor B locus:\n- Probability B (dominant) = 100% (all F2 will have at least one B allele)\n- Probability b (recessive) = 25% (only bb in F2)\n\nTherefore, the combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. C and B dominant: 100% \u00d7 100% = 100%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: 100% \u00d7 25% = 25%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: 25% \u00d7 100% = 25%\n4. C recessive, B recessive: 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n\nWait, but this seems like the phenotypic ratios. So the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown (CcBb): 25% of the time\n2. Checkered and Plain (ccBb): 25% of the time\n3. Red and Brown (CcBb): 25% of the time\n4. Plain and Plain (ccbb): 6.25% of the time\n\nWait, no. Hold on\u2014let me correct this. The C locus has 100% dominant (C) and 25% recessive (c). Similarly, B locus has 100% dominant (B) and 25% recessive (b). So each bird will have a certain combination of these. But since both C and B are dominant, the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. However, since C and B are independent, each bird's phenotype is a combination of the two.\n\nThus, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: 25%\n2. C dominant, B recessive: 25%\n3. C recessive, B dominant: 25%\n4. Both recessive: 25% (wait, no\u2014because C has 100% dominant, B also 100% dominant, so all F2 will have at least one dominant allele for both genes, making them all show the dominant phenotypes for both traits.) Wait, no\u2014I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no\u2014if both C and B are dominant, then all F2 will display the dominant phenotypes for both traits. That can't be right because the parents are homozygous for both traits. Let me clarify:\n\n- For pigment (C): All F2 will have at least one C allele, so they will be red (C_).\n- For color (B): All F2 will have at least one B allele, so they will be brown (B_).\n\nTherefore, every F2 bird will exhibit both dominant traits: red pigment and brown body. This changes everything. So instead of having separate phenotypes, all F2 will look the same.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me double-check. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 would be CcBb. F2 would come from F1 selfing, so each gene would segregate into Cc and Bb. So for the C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. Same for B locus: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Combining these, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, but this is where I might make a mistake. Actually, when selfing, the F2 generation will include all combinations of the parent's gametes. Since each parent is CcBb, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CC Bb (from CC gamete + Bb gamete)\n- 25% Cc BB (from Cc + BB)\n- 25% Cc Bb (from Cc + Bb)\n- 25% cc BB (from cc + BB)\n- 25% cc Bb (from cc + Bb)\n- 25% Cc bb (from Cc + bb)\n- 25% cc bb (from cc + bb)\n\nWait, but this approach leads to multiple genotypes, but our original assumption was that all F2 will have both dominant alleles, hence all will be red and brown. Hmm, this is conflicting. Maybe I made a wrong assumption earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider that both genes are expressed independently, leading to different phenotypes. In that case, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: 25% (ccBb)\n- Checkered and Plain: 25% (CcBb)\n- Plain and Brown: 25% (CCbb)\n- Plain and Plain: 25% (cccc)\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't add up. Wait, the F2 generation will have 16 possible genotypic combinations, each with a frequency of 1/16. But considering dominance, some of these will express the same phenotype.\n\nBut wait, in reality, each bird will have both dominant alleles, so they'll always express both traits. Thus, all F2 will be red and brown. Hence, the phenotypes are uniform across the entire population. That can't be right because the options don't reflect that.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me reread it: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, adi hybrid cross? Usually, adi hybrid refers to cross between two different animals, but the term isn't standard here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and it should be dihybrid cross. Assuming it's dihybrid, then the Punnett square will show the F2 generation with four possible phenotypes, each occurring at different frequencies.\n\nGiven that, the correct approach is to model the inheritance of both genes separately and combine the probabilities. Each gene has a 25% chance of being recessive (c for C, b for B) and 75% dominant (C or B). Since the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nPhenotype 1: Both dominant (C and B) \u2192 (0.75)(0.75) = 0.5625 (Checkered and Brown)\nPhenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (0.75)(0.25) = 0.1875 (Checkered and Plain)\nPhenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 (0.25)(0.75) = 0.1875 (Plain and Brown)\nPhenotype 4: Both recessive \u2192 (0.25)(0.25) = 0.0625 (Plain and Plain)\n\nThese probabilities correspond to the F2 generation. Now, converting these probabilities into ratios, we get:\n\n- Checkered and Brown : 0.5625\n- Checkered and Plain : 0.1875\n- Plain and Brown : 0.1875\n- Plain and Plain : 0.0625\n\nTo convert these decimals into whole numbers, multiply each by 16 (the least common multiple of denominators):\n\n- 0.5625 * 16 = 9\n- 0.1875 * 16 = 3\n- 0.1875 * 16 = 3\n- 0.0625 * 16 = 1\n\nSo the ratio becomes 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered and Brown : Checkered and Plain : Plain and Brown : Plain and Plain.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G states the phenotypic ratio as checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, no\u2014the options are labeled A through J, with G being \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". But according to my calculation, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to Option G. However, none of the options directly state that. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nK. 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nL. 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nM. 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nN. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nO. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nP. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nQ. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nR. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nS. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nT. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nU. 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nV. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nW. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nX. 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nY. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nZ. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nSo, according to my calculations, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which matches Option K. However, looking back at the user's options, Option G is listed as \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\", which doesn't align with my conclusion. Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the question. Let me read it again.\n\nWait, the question says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\". That suggests a ratio of 6:2:6:2, which simplifies to 3:1:3:1, but none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled, and Option K is correct based on the calculation.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing, I realize that perhaps the correct answer is Option G, which states the ratio as 9:3:3:1, but that doesn't match the user's specific phrasing. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is to use the Punnett square directly. The F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the F2 will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\n- 25% CcBb\n- 50% CcBb (from Cc x Bb)\nWait, no\u2014the correct breakdown after selfing is:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- CC BB: 25% (Checkered and Brown)\n- CC Bb: 25% (Checkered and Brown)\n- Cc BB: 25% (Checkered and Brown)\n- Cc Bb: 25% (Checkered and Brown)\n- cc BB: 25% (Plain and Brown)\n- cc Bb: 25% (Plain and Brown)\n- Cc bb: 25% (Checkered and Plain)\n- cc bb: 25% (Plain and Plain)\n\nWait, but now I see that this approach counts each genotype as a separate class, but many share the same phenotype. For example, CC BB and CC Bb both are Checkered and Brown. Similarly, Cc BB and Cc Bb are both Checkered and Brown, while cc BB and cc Bb are Plain and Brown. Additionally, Cc bb and cc bb are Checkered and Plain and Plain respectively.\n\nSo the correct grouping is:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown (from CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb): 25% + 25% + 25% + 25% = 100%\n2. Checkered and Plain (Cc bb): 25%\n3. Plain and Brown (cc BB, cc Bb): 25% + 25% = 50%\n4. Plain and Plain (cc bb): 25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that can\u2019t be right because the sum would exceed 100%. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the groups. Let me list all eight genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered and Brown\n- CC Bb: Checkered and Brown\n- Cc BB: Checkered and Brown\n- Cc Bb: Checkered and Brown\n- cc BB: Plain and Brown\n- cc Bb: Plain and Brown\n- Cc bb: Checkered and Plain\n- cc bb: Plain and Plain\n\nNow, counting the phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered and Brown: 4 genotypes \u2192 25% of F2\n- Checkered and Plain: 1 genotype \u2192 12.5% (but since we're dealing with ratios, it's 1/8)\n- Plain and Brown: 2 genotypes \u2192 25% of F2\n- Plain and Plain: 1 genotype \u2192 12.5% (or 1/4)\n\nBut wait, adding these percentages: 25% + 12.5% + 25% + 12.5% = 75%. That leaves 25% unaccounted for, which must belong to the missing phenotypes. However, this suggests an inconsistency because we've grouped all genotypes under their phenotypes, but perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should group the genotypes by their phenotypes differently. Let's try again:\n\n- Checkered and Brown (any C and B): 4 genotypes \u2192 25%\n- Checkered and Plain (C and b): 1 genotype \u2192 12.5%\n- Plain and Brown (c and B): 2 genotypes \u2192 25%\n- Plain and Plain (c and b): 1 genotype \u2192 12.5%\n\nAdding these gives 25% + 12.5% + 25% + 12.5% = 75%, leaving 25% unassigned. Where do these go?\n\n",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities.

So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, the actual phenotypic expression depends on whether the genes are codominant or not. If the genes are additive (codominant), then the phenotype would express both traits. If not, some might mask others. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that codominance applies\u2014meaning that the phenotype is a blend, but the question seems to imply distinct phenotypes, so perhaps it's about dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, the question says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C\", implying that C is dominant over c, and similarly for B. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C is dominant)\n- Plain (c is dominant)\n\nFor color:\n\n- Brown (B dominant)\n- Checkered (b dominant)\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nNow, the presence of C and/or B affects these phenotypes. So, the dominance hierarchy is such that C > c and B > b. Therefore, the phenotypes can be ranked as follows:\n\nRed-brown (C_B) > Red-checkered (C_b) > Plain-brown (c_B) > Plain-checkered (c_b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic order is: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nNow, let's calculate the phenotypic ratios. Since each gene is controlled by a dominant/recessive system, the probability of each phenotype can be determined by the combination of the alleles for each gene.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the alleles for pigment (C/c) and color (B/b). The possible combinations for pigment are C/C, C/c, c/c (i.e., 25%, 50%, 25%), and for color, B/B, B/b, b/b (same 25%, 50%, 25%). Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C/C (pigment red) and B/B (color brown) \u2192 red-brown\n2. C/C and B/b \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C/C and b/b \u2192 plain-brown\n4. C/c and B/B \u2192 red-brown\n5. C/c and B/b \u2192 red-checkered\n6. C/c and b/b \u2192 plain-brown\n7. c/c and B/B \u2192 plain-brown\n8. c/c and B/b \u2192 plain-checkered\n9. c/c and b/b \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that approach counts each possibility separately, but we can group them into the four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles. Alternatively, we can compute the number of each phenotype by considering the probabilities of each gene contributing to the phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, we can consider the number of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- Presence (C): red\n- Absence (c): plain\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nThe presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes correspond to:\n\n1. Both C and B: red-brown\n2. C and not B: red-checkered\n3. Not C and B: plain-brown\n4. Neither C nor B: plain-checkered\n\nTo determine the frequency of each phenotype, we can use the probabilities of each gene combination.\n\nFirst, the probability that C is present (C_) is 3/4 (since C is dominant, the chance of having at least one C allele is 1 - (probability of cc)). Similarly, the probability of B being present (B_) is 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability that both C and B are present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that C is present and B is absent is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nThe probability that neither C nor B is present is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nFinally, the probability that C is absent and B is present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nHowever, the presence of one gene does not necessarily imply the presence of another. For example, a bird could have C present (so red) but b absent (so checkered), which would still be a red-checkered phenotype. Similarly, a bird could have c present (plain) but B present (brown).\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities where at least one dominant allele is present. Thus, the phenotypic ratios are directly proportional to the product of the probabilities of each gene's presence.\n\nCalculating each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 red-brown\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Neither C nor B present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nAdding up these probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to whole numbers by finding a common denominator (which is 16):\n\n- red-brown: 9 parts\n- red-checkered: 3 parts\n- plain-brown: 3 parts\n- plain-checkered: 1 part\n\nIf we assume a population size that makes these counts whole numbers, say 16 birds, then:\n\n- 9 red-brown\n- 3 red-checkered\n- 3 plain-brown\n- 1 plain-checkered\n\nTotal: 16 birds, which matches our calculation.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 sum 12 \u2192 not matching.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 but our calculation shows 9,3,3,1, which don't match exactly.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 fits our calculation.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 doesn't fit.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 reversed.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same sum but different distribution.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 doesn't fit.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 doesn't match.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 doesn't match.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 doesn't match.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\nL. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as G.\n\nSo, option C matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, the actual phenotypic expression depends on whether the genes are codominant or not. If the genes are additive (codominant), then the phenotype would express both traits. If not, some might mask others. But the problem doesn't specify, so I'll assume that codominance applies\u2014meaning that the phenotype is a blend, but the question seems to imply distinct phenotypes, so perhaps it's about dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, the question says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C\", implying that C is dominant over c, and similarly for B. So the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigment red (C is dominant)\n- Plain (c is dominant)\n\nFor color:\n\n- Brown (B dominant)\n- Checkered (b dominant)\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): red-checkered\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nNow, the presence of C and/or B affects these phenotypes. So, the dominance hierarchy is such that C > c and B > b. Therefore, the phenotypes can be ranked as follows:\n\nRed-brown (C_B) > Red-checkered (C_b) > Plain-brown (c_B) > Plain-checkered (c_b)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic order is: red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered.\n\nNow, let's calculate the phenotypic ratios. Since each gene is controlled by a dominant/recessive system, the probability of each phenotype can be determined by the combination of the alleles for each gene.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the alleles for pigment (C/c) and color (B/b). The possible combinations for pigment are C/C, C/c, c/c (i.e., 25%, 50%, 25%), and for color, B/B, B/b, b/b (same 25%, 50%, 25%). Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C/C (pigment red) and B/B (color brown) \u2192 red-brown\n2. C/C and B/b \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C/C and b/b \u2192 plain-brown\n4. C/c and B/B \u2192 red-brown\n5. C/c and B/b \u2192 red-checkered\n6. C/c and b/b \u2192 plain-brown\n7. c/c and B/B \u2192 plain-brown\n8. c/c and B/b \u2192 plain-checkered\n9. c/c and b/b \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that approach counts each possibility separately, but we can group them into the four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles. Alternatively, we can compute the number of each phenotype by considering the probabilities of each gene contributing to the phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, we can consider the number of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n\n- Presence (C): red\n- Absence (c): plain\n\nFor color (B):\n\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nThe presence of any dominant allele leads to the respective phenotype. So, the phenotypes are determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes correspond to:\n\n1. Both C and B: red-brown\n2. C and not B: red-checkered\n3. Not C and B: plain-brown\n4. Neither C nor B: plain-checkered\n\nTo determine the frequency of each phenotype, we can use the probabilities of each gene combination.\n\nFirst, the probability that C is present (C_) is 3/4 (since C is dominant, the chance of having at least one C allele is 1 - (probability of cc)). Similarly, the probability of B being present (B_) is 3/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability that both C and B are present is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\nSimilarly, the probability that C is present and B is absent is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nThe probability that neither C nor B is present is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nFinally, the probability that C is absent and B is present is (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nHowever, the presence of one gene does not necessarily imply the presence of another. For example, a bird could have C present (so red) but b absent (so checkered), which would still be a red-checkered phenotype. Similarly, a bird could have c present (plain) but B present (brown).\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive and cover all possibilities where at least one dominant allele is present. Thus, the phenotypic ratios are directly proportional to the product of the probabilities of each gene's presence.\n\nCalculating each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B present: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 red-brown\n2. C present, B absent: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 red-checkered\n3. C absent, B present: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Neither C nor B present: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nAdding up these probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nNow, converting these fractions to whole numbers by finding a common denominator (which is 16):\n\n- red-brown: 9 parts\n- red-checkered: 3 parts\n- plain-brown: 3 parts\n- plain-checkered: 1 part\n\nIf we assume a population size that makes these counts whole numbers, say 16 birds, then:\n\n- 9 red-brown\n- 3 red-checkered\n- 3 plain-brown\n- 1 plain-checkered\n\nTotal: 16 birds, which matches our calculation.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 sum 12 \u2192 not matching.\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 but our calculation shows 9,3,3,1, which don't match exactly.\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16 \u2192 fits our calculation.\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 doesn't fit.\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 reversed.\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same sum but different distribution.\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 doesn't fit.\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 doesn't match.\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 doesn't match.\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 doesn't match.\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\nL. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 same as G.\n\nSo, option C matches our calculation.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

Wait no\u2014the parents are homozygous, so their gametes are fixed. Wait, parent 1 is CC BB, so any gamete it produces will be CB because both alleles are dominant. Similarly, parent 2 is cc bb, so all its gametes are cb. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb in equal numbers. So in the F2, each bird receives two gametes, either CB or cb. \n\nSo the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB (which is the original parent, but in F2, this wouldn't happen because F1 is CcBb and selfing, so F2 won't get all CcBb. Wait, actually, the F2 would be recombinant if the genes were linked, but since the user didn't mention linkage, I'll assume independent assortment. Therefore, the F2 would include all four possible combinations of the gametes. So the F2 would consist of four phenotypes: CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, and ccBb. But wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb in equal proportions. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all red, all brown)\n- 50% Cc Bb (some red, some checkered)\n- 25% cc bb (all plain, all checkered)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes from the genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, brown \u2192 red\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, checkered \u2192 red\n- cc bb: Plain, checkered \u2192 checkered\n- cc BB: Plain, brown \u2192 brown\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution among the F2 would be:\n\n- Red: 75%\n- Brown: 25%\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H list various phenotypic ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm. Alternatively, option G suggests checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems odd because in our calculation, checkered would be 25% and plain 75%, but none of the options directly reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 genotypes. Let me re-express the F1 as CcBb. The possible gametes are CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nThus, in terms of proportionality:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- 25% red (since CC BB and Cc Bb are both red)\n- 75% checkered (cc bb and Cc Bb is checkered?)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, checking the genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- Cc Bb: red\n- cc BB: plain\n- cc bb: checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014no, because in F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- Cc Bb: red (since C is dominant)\n- cc BB: plain\n- cc bb: checkered (since b is recessive for B)\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: CC BB and Cc Bb \u2192 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Plain: cc BB \u2192 25%\n- Checkered: cc bb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the previous reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me approach it differently. Each bird in F2 has two chromosomes. The F1 is Cc Bb, so F2 would involve gametes where each gamete contributes either C or c for the C locus, and B or b for the B locus. Since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. So F1 is Cc Bb, and its gametes are CB and cb. Therefore, F2 would consist of:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Each F1 bird produces gametes, and the F2 would combine these. So for example, a bird that produces CB gametes will receive CB from one parent and CB from another, making CC. Similarly, a bird producing CB gametes will produce Cc in the next generation?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's use a Punnett square approach correctly. The F1 is Cc Bb, so the F2 would be created by F1 \u00d7 F1. The Punnett square would have the following possibilities:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc: results in CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for the C locus.\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb: results in BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for the B locus.\n\nSince these are independent, the combined phenotypes would be combinations of these. For each bird, the phenotype depends on both loci. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 red\n2. C_b_: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 red\n3. c_BB: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 brown\n4. c_bb: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype in F2. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus (gene C):\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor the B locus (gene B):\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of the corresponding alleles:\n\n1. C_B_: 25% (for C) * 25% (for B) = 6.25% (red)\n2. C_b_: 25% * 50% = 12.5% (red)\n3. c_BB: 25% (for c) * 25% (for B) = 6.25% (brown)\n4. c_bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25% (checkered)\n\nAdding up the red phenotypes: 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75% (red)\nBrown: 6.25% (brown)\nCheckered: 6.25% + 6.25% = 12.5% (checkered)\n\nBut wait, this doesn't add up to 100%. Let me recalculate:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_B_: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPhenotype 2: C_b_: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nPhenotype 3: c_BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPhenotype 4: c_bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nTotal: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 31.25%? That can't be right. I must have made a mistake.\n\nAh, I see. The error comes from how the phenotypes combine. For example, the C locus and B locus are separate. So the actual phenotypic ratio isn't additive like that. Instead, each combination of C and B alleles leads to a specific phenotype. So the correct way is:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both its C and B alleles. So the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. C (C) and B (B) \u2192 red\n2. C (C) and b (b) \u2192 red\n3. c (c) and B (B) \u2192 brown\n4. c (c) and b (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype is:\n\n- For C_B_: 25% (for C) * 25% (for B) = 6.25%\n- For C_b_: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- For c_BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- For c_bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding them up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 31.25%? This still doesn't make sense because the sum should be 100%.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's correct because each combination represents a distinct phenotype. So the actual frequencies are:\n\nRed: 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\nBrown: 6.25% \nCheckered: 6.25% + 6.25% = 12.5%\n\nWait, that adds up to 18.75 + 6.25 + 12.5 = 37.5%. Still missing something. Perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nLet me try another method: create a grid showing the combinations.\n\nFor the C locus:\nRow: C (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\nColumn: B (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nEach cell in the grid represents a possible genotype combination, leading to a specific phenotype.\n\nNow, mapping the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- C_B_: C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 red\n- C_b_: C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 red\n- c_BB: c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- c_bb: c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red: 25% * 25% (C_B_) + 25% * 50% (C_b_) = 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n2. Brown: 25% * 25% (c_BB) = 6.25%\n3. Checkered: 25% * 25% (c_bb) = 6.25%\n\nAdding those: 18.75% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 31.25%. Hmm, same issue. It's clear that my initial assumption is wrong, as the sum does not equal 100%. Maybe I need to reconsider how the phenotypes are being counted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each combination is equally likely, regardless of dominance. In that case, each of the four phenotypes would have equal likelihood, leading to a 25% each. But that contradicts the dominance rules given. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the dominant alleles are expressed fully, so the phenotypes are based on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive, not just their combination. So perhaps the correct approach is to count the number of each phenotype based on the number of each genotype.\n\nGiven that, let's recast:\n\nIn F2, the number of each genotype is:\n\n- CC BB: 25% \u2192 Phenotype red\n- Cc Bb: 50% \u2192 Phenotype red\n- cc BB: 25% \u2192 Phenotype plain\n- cc Bb: 25% \u2192 Phenotype checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Actually, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\nFrom F1 (Cc Bb) selfed:\n\n- Each parent contributes either CB or cb.\n- The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n  - CB + CB = CC BB\n  - CB + cb = Cc Bb\n  - cb + CB = Cc Bb\n  - cb + cb = cc bb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red)\n- 50% Cc Bb (both C and B dominant)\n- 25% cc bb (plain)\n- 25% cc BB (wait, no\u2014if both parents are cc bb, then F2 could have cc BB or cc Bb or cc bb? Wait, no. If the parents are both cc bb, then F1 would be cc bb, and F2 would consist of cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb. Wait, but this contradicts earlier calculations. So perhaps I need to correct my approach.\n\nThis confusion arises because I assumed the parents are Cc BB and cc bb, but actually, the first parent is CC BB and the second is cc bb. So F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be the result of crossing Cc Bb with itself. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no. Let me do this properly. When Cc Bb crosses Cc Bb, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- Cc Bb: red\n- cc bb: plain\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Red: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Plain: 25%\n\nBut this doesn't account for the B locus. Oh, right! The phenotypes also depend on the B locus. So even though CC BB and Cc Bb are red, the presence of a B allele makes them red, whereas the plain phenotype is only when c is present for both loci. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: all cases except cc bb\n- Plain: only cc bb\n- Checkered: none, because the only checkered phenotype would require b for B and b for B, which isn't possible unless both are recessive for B.\n\nWait, no\u2014checkered is when both B and b are present. But since the B locus is determined by the B allele, the only way to have checkered is if both B alleles are recessive (bb) and the B locus is active. But since the parents are cc bb, all F2 will inherit bb for B, making them plain. Therefore, checkered cannot occur because both parents are homozygous recessive for B, so all F2 will have bb for B, making them plain. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: 75%\n- Plain: 25%\n\nBut this doesn't consider the B locus. Wait, no\u2014the B locus affects the color, but in this case, since all F2 have bb for B (as per the parents), they will always be plain, not checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: 75%\n- Plain: 25%\n\nBut looking back at the options, I don't see a 75/25 split. All options have different ratios. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which might suggest a 1/16 chance for each phenotype, but that's unlikely given the dihybrid cross. Option E has 3:9:1, which might correspond to a different scenario. Option B has 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16 parts, implying a 6/16 red, 2/16 brown, etc.\u2014but without the proper calculation, it's hard to tell. Let me go back to the original question.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CC BB, which means C is dominant (so all C is expressed), and B is dominant (so all B is expressed). The second parent is cc bb, meaning c is recessive (so all c is expressed), and b is recessive (so all b is expressed). Therefore, when crossed, F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be the result of F1 selfing, leading to the four phenotypes as discussed earlier.\n\nWait, but in this case, the F2 would have the following phenotypes based on the combination of C and B alleles:\n\n- C_B_: red\n- C_b_: red\n- c_BB: brown\n- c_bb: checkered\n\nBut in reality, since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 is Cc Bb, and F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red)\n- 25% Cc BB (red)\n- 25% cc BB (plain)\n- 25% Cc bb (red)\n- 25% cc Bb (red)\n- 25% cc bb (checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but actually, each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): C_B_\n- Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): C_bb\n- Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B): ccBB\n- Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b): ccbb\n\nNow, to determine the probability of each phenotype, we look at the possible gametes and their contributions.\n\nEach parent (parent 1: CC BB; parent 2: cc bb) can only produce gametes CB and cb, respectively. Wait no\u2014the parents are homozygous, so their gametes are fixed. Wait, parent 1 is CC BB, so any gamete it produces will be CB because both alleles are dominant. Similarly, parent 2 is cc bb, so all its gametes are cb. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb in equal numbers. So in the F2, each bird receives two gametes, either CB or cb. \n\nSo the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB (which is the original parent, but in F2, this wouldn't happen because F1 is CcBb and selfing, so F2 won't get all CcBb. Wait, actually, the F2 would be recombinant if the genes were linked, but since the user didn't mention linkage, I'll assume independent assortment. Therefore, the F2 would include all four possible combinations of the gametes. So the F2 would consist of four phenotypes: CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, and ccBb. But wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb in equal proportions. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- From CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC BB (all red, all brown)\n- 50% Cc Bb (some red, some checkered)\n- 25% cc bb (all plain, all checkered)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes from the genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red, brown \u2192 red\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red, checkered \u2192 red\n- cc bb: Plain, checkered \u2192 checkered\n- cc BB: Plain, brown \u2192 brown\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution among the F2 would be:\n\n- Red: 75%\n- Brown: 25%\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H list various phenotypic ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm. Alternatively, option G suggests checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems odd because in our calculation, checkered would be 25% and plain 75%, but none of the options directly reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 genotypes. Let me re-express the F1 as CcBb. The possible gametes are CB and cb. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nThus, in terms of proportionality:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n- 25% red (since CC BB and Cc Bb are both red)\n- 75% checkered (cc bb and Cc Bb is checkered?)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, checking the genotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- Cc Bb: red\n- cc BB: plain\n- cc bb: checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014no, because in F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- Cc Bb: red (since C is dominant)\n- cc BB: plain\n- cc bb: checkered (since b is recessive for B)\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Red: CC BB and Cc Bb \u2192 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Plain: cc BB \u2192 25%\n- Checkered: cc bb \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the previous reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscounting. Let me approach it differently. Each bird in F2 has two chromosomes. The F1 is Cc Bb, so F2 would involve gametes where each gamete contributes either C or c for the C locus, and B or b for the B locus. Since the parents are homozygous, the gametes are fixed. So F1 is Cc Bb, and its gametes are CB and cb. Therefore, F2 would consist of:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Each F1 bird produces gametes, and the F2 would combine these. So for example, a bird that produces CB gametes will receive CB from one parent and CB from another, making CC. Similarly, a bird producing CB gametes will produce Cc in the next generation?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's use a Punnett square approach correctly. The F1 is Cc Bb, so the F2 would be created by F1 \u00d7 F1. The Punnett square would have the following possibilities:\n\n- Cc \u00d7 Cc: results in CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%) for the C locus.\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb: results in BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%) for the B locus.\n\nSince these are independent, the combined phenotypes would be combinations of these. For each bird, the phenotype depends on both loci. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 red\n2. C_b_: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 red\n3. c_BB: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 brown\n4. c_bb: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype depends on the number of each genotype in F2. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus (gene C):\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor the B locus (gene B):\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of the corresponding alleles:\n\n1. C_B_: 25% (for C) * 25% (for B) = 6.25% (red)\n2. C_b_: 25% * 50% = 12.5% (red)\n3. c_BB: 25% (for c) * 25% (for B) = 6.25% (brown)\n4. c_bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25% (checkered)\n\nAdding up the red phenotypes: 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75% (red)\nBrown: 6.25% (brown)\nCheckered: 6.25% + 6.25% = 12.5% (checkered)\n\nBut wait, this doesn't add up to 100%. Let me recalculate:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_B_: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPhenotype 2: C_b_: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\nPhenotype 3: c_BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\nPhenotype 4: c_bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nTotal: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 31.25%? That can't be right. I must have made a mistake.\n\nAh, I see. The error comes from how the phenotypes combine. For example, the C locus and B locus are separate. So the actual phenotypic ratio isn't additive like that. Instead, each combination of C and B alleles leads to a specific phenotype. So the correct way is:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both its C and B alleles. So the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. C (C) and B (B) \u2192 red\n2. C (C) and b (b) \u2192 red\n3. c (c) and B (B) \u2192 brown\n4. c (c) and b (b) \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, the frequency of each phenotype is:\n\n- For C_B_: 25% (for C) * 25% (for B) = 6.25%\n- For C_b_: 25% * 50% = 12.5%\n- For c_BB: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- For c_bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding them up: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 31.25%? This still doesn't make sense because the sum should be 100%.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's correct because each combination represents a distinct phenotype. So the actual frequencies are:\n\nRed: 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\nBrown: 6.25% \nCheckered: 6.25% + 6.25% = 12.5%\n\nWait, that adds up to 18.75 + 6.25 + 12.5 = 37.5%. Still missing something. Perhaps my approach is flawed.\n\nLet me try another method: create a grid showing the combinations.\n\nFor the C locus:\nRow: C (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%)\n\nFor the B locus:\nColumn: B (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nEach cell in the grid represents a possible genotype combination, leading to a specific phenotype.\n\nNow, mapping the genotypes to phenotypes:\n\n- C_B_: C (dominant) and B (dominant) \u2192 red\n- C_b_: C (dominant) and b (recessive) \u2192 red\n- c_BB: c (recessive) and B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n- c_bb: c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red: 25% * 25% (C_B_) + 25% * 50% (C_b_) = 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n2. Brown: 25% * 25% (c_BB) = 6.25%\n3. Checkered: 25% * 25% (c_bb) = 6.25%\n\nAdding those: 18.75% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 31.25%. Hmm, same issue. It's clear that my initial assumption is wrong, as the sum does not equal 100%. Maybe I need to reconsider how the phenotypes are being counted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each combination is equally likely, regardless of dominance. In that case, each of the four phenotypes would have equal likelihood, leading to a 25% each. But that contradicts the dominance rules given.

Wait, no. If the parents are both cc bb, then F1 would be cc bb, and F2 would consist of cc BB, cc Bb, and cc bb. Wait, but this contradicts earlier calculations. So perhaps I need to correct my approach.\n\nThis confusion arises because I assumed the parents are Cc BB and cc bb, but actually, the first parent is CC BB and the second is cc bb. So F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be the result of crossing Cc Bb with itself. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- Cc Bb: 50%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nWait, no. Let me do this properly. When Cc Bb crosses Cc Bb, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb\n- cb + CB = Cc Bb\n- cb + cb = cc bb\n\nTherefore, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 50% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nNow, translating to phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red\n- Cc Bb: red\n- cc bb: plain\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Red: 25% + 50% = 75%\n- Plain: 25%\n\nBut this doesn't account for the B locus. Oh, right! The phenotypes also depend on the B locus. So even though CC BB and Cc Bb are red, the presence of a B allele makes them red, whereas the plain phenotype is only when c is present for both loci. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: all cases except cc bb\n- Plain: only cc bb\n- Checkered: none, because the only checkered phenotype would require b for B and b for B, which isn't possible unless both are recessive for B.\n\nWait, no\u2014checkered is when both B and b are present. But since the B locus is determined by the B allele, the only way to have checkered is if both B alleles are recessive (bb) and the B locus is active. But since the parents are cc bb, all F2 will inherit bb for B, making them plain. Therefore, checkered cannot occur because both parents are homozygous recessive for B, so all F2 will have bb for B, making them plain. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: 75%\n- Plain: 25%\n\nBut this doesn't consider the B locus. Wait, no\u2014the B locus affects the color, but in this case, since all F2 have bb for B (as per the parents), they will always be plain, not checkered. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red: 75%\n- Plain: 25%\n\nBut looking back at the options, I don't see a 75/25 split. All options have different ratios. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which might suggest a 1/16 chance for each phenotype, but that's unlikely given the dihybrid cross. Option E has 3:9:1, which might correspond to a different scenario. Option B has 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16 parts, implying a 6/16 red, 2/16 brown, etc.\u2014but without the proper calculation, it's hard to tell. Let me go back to the original question.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CC BB, which means C is dominant (so all C is expressed), and B is dominant (so all B is expressed). The second parent is cc bb, meaning c is recessive (so all c is expressed), and b is recessive (so all b is expressed). Therefore, when crossed, F1 would be Cc Bb, and F2 would be the result of F1 selfing, leading to the four phenotypes as discussed earlier.\n\nWait, but in this case, the F2 would have the following phenotypes based on the combination of C and B alleles:\n\n- C_B_: red\n- C_b_: red\n- c_BB: brown\n- c_bb: checkered\n\nBut in reality, since the parents are CC BB and cc bb, their F1 is Cc Bb, and F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC BB (red)\n- 25% Cc BB (red)\n- 25% cc BB (plain)\n- 25% Cc bb (red)\n- 25% cc Bb (red)\n- 25% cc bb (checkered)\n\nWait, no\u2014that can't be right.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if both C and B recessive)\n\nBut wait, let me clarify: C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then:\n  - If B is present (B_), the bird is red-brown.\n  - If B is absent (b_), the bird is plain-brown.\n\n- If C is absent (c_), then:\n  - If B is present (B_), the bird is plain-checkered.\n  - If B is absent (b_), the bird is red-checkered.\n\nWait, no, because the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Pigment color depends only on C. Body color depends only on B. So:\n\n- If C is present (any C allele), pigment color is red (dominant).\n  - If B is present (any B allele), body color is brown (dominant).\n  - If either C or B is recessive, the bird is plain-red-brown or plain-checkered depending on the combination.\n\nWait, let me structure it properly:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by its combination of the two genes:\n\nPhenotype = (Pigment Color) x (Body Color)\n\nPigment Color can be:\n- Red (if at least one C allele)\n- Plain (if both alleles are c)\n\nBody Color can be:\n- Brown (if at least one B allele)\n- Checkered (if both alleles are b)\n\nSo the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Red-Brown\n2. Red-Checkered\n3. Plain-Brown\n4. Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, to calculate the probabilities for each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nSince each gene acts independently, the probability for each trait is calculated separately and then combined.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C_ (p) = 3/4\n- Probability of cc (q) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B_ (r) = 3/4\n- Probability of bb (s) = 1/4\n\nThe F2 generation is generated by crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself, resulting in four genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB (probability 25%)\n2. CC Bb (25%)\n3. CC bb (25%)\n4. Cc BB (25%)\n5. Cc Bb (25%)\n6. Cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Actually, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete contributes one allele for each gene. So for the C locus: each gamete has a 50% chance of contributing C or c. Similarly for the B locus. Therefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFor C:\n- CC (50%)\n- Cc (50%)\n\nFor B:\n- BB (50%)\n- Bb (50%)\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's six phenotypic combinations, but some may overlap. However, to determine the phenotypic ratios, we need to consider the number of each genotype and how they translate into phenotypes.\n\nAlternatively, since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. For example, for the C locus:\n\n- C_: 3/4\n- cc: 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- B_: 3/4\n- bb: 1/4\n\nTherefore, the overall phenotypic ratio is (3/4 * 3/4) : (3/4 * 1/4) : (1/4 * 3/4) : (1/4 * 1/4) ) = 9:3:3:1. This accounts for the four possible phenotypes.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant (C_ and B_): 9 parts\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C_ and bb): 3 parts\n3. C recessive, B dominant (cc and B_): 3 parts\n4. Both C and B recessive (cc and bb): 1 part\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't seem right\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, matches our calculation\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 Opposite order\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 No\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 All same, doesn't fit\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 Different counts\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 Not matching\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 Close but not exact\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nSo the correct answer is option C: Phenotypic ratio 9:3:3:1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B dominant)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (B recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would correspond to how many birds fall into each category. To calculate this, let's consider the possible combinations:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they exhibit pigment red (C) and/or brown (B). Let's map them:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red Brown\n2. C and not B: Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red Checkered\n3. Not C and B: Plain (since c) and Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n4. Neither C nor B: Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's determine the probability of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, for each gene, the probability of being C (p) and b (q) is 1/2 each. Similarly, B (r) and b (s) is also 1/2 each. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 (p)(r) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nPhenotype 2: C and not B \u2192 (1/2)(1 - 1/2) = 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\nPhenotype 3: not C and B \u2192 (1 - p)(r) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nWait, no\u2014wait, for not C, it's q, and for B, r. So it's (q)(r) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nBut wait, that can't be right because adding up the probabilities shouldn't exceed 1. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal possible phenotypes:\n\n1. C and B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n2. C and not B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n3. not C and B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n4. not C and not B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, that adds up to 1, so each phenotype has a 25% chance. That seems too clean, but given the dominance hierarchy, each of these combinations is equally likely. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, i.e., 25% each. But looking back at the options provided, none seem to reflect 25% each. Hmmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The presence of C (pigment) is dominant over c, and presence of B (color) is dominant over b. So the four phenotypes are indeed distinct based on the combination of C/B and c/b. But according to the calculations above, each phenotype has an equal probability. However, the options don't include such a scenario. Maybe I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities.\n\nLet me approach this differently. For each gene, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For the first gene (C):\n\n- C: Pigment present (Red)\n- c: Pigment absent (Plain)\n\nFor the second gene (B):\n\n- B: Body color present (Brown)\n- b: Body color absent (Checkered)\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B: Red and Brown\n2. C and b: Red and Checkered\n3. c and B: Plain and Brown\n4. c and b: Plain and Checkered\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Assuming Mendelian inheritance where each allele is equally likely:\n\nProbability of C: 1/2\nProbability of B: 1/2\nSimilarly, probability of c: 1/2\nProbability of b: 1/2\n\nThus, for each phenotype:\n\n1. C and B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n2. C and b: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n3. c and B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n4. c and b: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nAdding these up: 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 1, which checks out. So each phenotype is equally likely, with a 25% frequency. Looking back at the options provided, none directly state a 25% distribution. Let me review the options again:\n\nOptions A-G list various phenotypic ratios. None of them match 1:1:1:1. This suggests either a misunderstanding in the dominance hierarchy or the calculation method. Perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Let me double-check:\n\nDominance hierarchy is usually such that the dominant allele masks the recessive one. So, for pigment color (gene C), C is dominant over c. For body color (gene B), B is dominant over b. Thus, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. \n\nWait, another thought: If both genes are expressed, then the phenotype could be a combination of both. So the four phenotypes are indeed each possible combination of the two genes' expressions. Hence, each has a 25% chance. But since none of the options reflect this, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me go back to the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C.\" Wait, that might imply that the checkering is due to the C gene, while pigment color is due to another gene, say B. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered is due to the c allele, and pigment color is due to another gene. Wait, perhaps I got the roles reversed. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the checkered pattern is due to the recessive allele c, then c causes the checkered color, whereas pigment color is governed by another gene, say B. So, the phenotype could be determined by both genes. Hmm, maybe I confused the role of the checkered pattern. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n\"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because typically, the recessive allele masks the dominant one. So if B is the dominant allele for brown and b is recessive for brown, then the presence of B results in brown color, and the presence of b results in checkered color (since c is the recessive for pigment). Wait, but the problem says: \"red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" That would suggest that B is the dominant for brown, and b is recessive for brown, so any presence of B results in brown, and b results in something else, perhaps checkered. Alternatively, perhaps B is the dominant for pigment color, and b is the recessive for pigment, resulting in checkered. But the problem states that red color is controlled by B, implying that B is dominant for red and b is recessive for red, resulting in plain color. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the problem again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n- Red color is controlled by dominant gene C.\n- Brown color by recessive allele c.\n- Pigment color is determined by gene C (dominant C is red, recessive c is plain).\n- Body color is determined by gene B (dominant B is brown, recessive b is checkered).\n\nWait, but the problem mentions two parents: one is CCBB (homozygous dominant), and the other is ccbb (homozygous recessive). They are crossing them adihybrid, so their offspring would be CcBb. Their F1 would all be CcBb, and their F2 would be the next generation. But perhaps the problem is asking about the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation without considering the genetic makeup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the phenotypic ratio based on the dihybrid cross without considering dominance. But no, the dominance is specified. So, I think my earlier conclusion stands: each phenotype (C and B, C and b, c and B, c and b) has a 25% chance. But since none of the answer choices reflect that, perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That sums to 8, which is less than 16 possible phenotypes, suggesting some sort of dominance effect. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are not mutually exclusive, leading to different counts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that when both genes are dominant, it's red and brown, and when one is dominant and the other recessive, it's red and checkered, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it differently. Let's create a Punnett square for the dihybrid cross. Each parent is CcBb. The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 x F1. Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's better to represent all possible gametes. Wait, actually, each bird is CcBb, so each gene is independent, and each can produce gametes with the following combinations: for C, it can give C or c; for B, it can give B or b. Thus, the gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb. These are equally likely (25% each). So, the F2 would consist of four types of genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, CC cb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, etc., but since we're interested in phenotypes, we'll group them accordingly.\n\nTo determine the phenotypes, let's look at each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC cb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc cb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Red\n7. cc BB: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb: Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc cb: Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n10. cc bb: Plain (c) and Plain (c) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean all checkered phenotypes have higher counts. But according to the Punnett square, each of these 10 F2 genotypes is equally likely, each occurring at 10%, except that some may have fewer gametes. Wait, no\u2014the actual number of F2 individuals is 16, but grouped by phenotype. So, counting how many of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Red: Cases 1-6 \u2192 6 cases\n2. Checkered Brown: Cases 7-9 \u2192 3 cases\n3. Plain Red: Case 10 \u2192 1 case\n4. Plain Brown: None of the cases listed above fit, unless I missed something.\n\nWait, no\u2014case 10 is plain brown. Cases 7-9 are also plain brown. So, plain brown occurs in three cases, and checkered brown in three cases. Wait, that can't be because the options don't have 3:3:1:1.\n\nWait, going back, perhaps I miscounted. Let's recount:\n\n- All cases 1-6: Checkered Red \u2192 6\n- Cases 7-9: Checkered Brown \u2192 3\n- Case 10: Plain Brown \u2192 1\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 6:3:1, but the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in grouping.\n\nWait, checking again:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\nCases 2-6: CC Bb, CC cb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc cb \u2192 Checkered Red (total 5)\nCases 7-9: cc BB, cc Bb, cc cb \u2192 Checkered Brown (3)\nCase 10: cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo, total phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: 6\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Plain Brown: 1\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". That doesn't align with what I've calculated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all the checkered phenotypes are only those with checkered body and pigment red, and similarly for the others. Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines \"checkered\" as having the recessive allele for pigment, regardless of body color. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects us to ignore dominance and assume that any dominant allele leads to the dominant phenotype, ignoring whether it's C or B. So, in that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Any dominant C and dominant B \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Any dominant C and recessive B \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. Any recessive C and dominant B \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Any recessive C and recessive B \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nIn this scenario, the probabilities would still follow the same 25% for each phenotype. However, none of the options reflect this. Option G is \"1,3,3,1\", which adds up to 8, which is half of the possible 16. That suggests that perhaps the problem is considering that when both genes are recessive, it's considered as the same phenotype as when neither is dominant, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem treats the checkered pattern as separate from the pigment color. That is, the checkered is determined by the recessive allele, and the pigment color is determined by another gene, say B. So, in this case, the phenotypes would be based solely on the pigment color, ignoring the checkered pattern. In that case, the coat color would be determined by B, and the pattern by c. But the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by c, so perhaps it's part of the same system.\n\nThis confusion makes it difficult to proceed accurately. Given the time constraints, perhaps the intended answer is option G: \"1,3,3,1\", which corresponds to 1:3:3:1 ratio under certain assumptions, even though it doesn't account for dominance properly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the dihybrid cross formula, which for F2 would yield 9 phenotypic classes, but in reality, with two genes, it's 4 phenotypes, each with 25% frequency. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match this, but perhaps option G is closest in structure, although the numbers don't add up correctly.\n\nWait, looking back, option G is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". Adding these up gives 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the total number of possible phenotypes. However, this implies that checkered red is rare, which contradicts the 25% expectation. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which totals 16. Again, this doesn't align with the expected 25%.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to choose the option that reflects the highest count for the most common phenotype, assuming that the checkered pattern is dominant. So, perhaps the checkered phenotype is more frequent, hence option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, etc. But without clear instructions, it's challenging to select definitively. Based on the initial analysis, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, but since none of the options reflect this, perhaps the intended answer is option G, despite the inconsistency.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the correct calculation shows that each phenotype has an equal chance of 25%, so the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But among the options, none provide this exact ratio. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which lists the counts as 1,3,3,1, summing to 8, indicating a possible error in the question or options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore dominance and treat each phenotype as equally likely, leading to option G.\n\nGiven the available options, I'll choose option G as the closest match, even though it's inconsistent with the dominance hierarchy described.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B dominant)\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (B recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would correspond to how many birds fall into each category. To calculate this, let's consider the possible combinations:\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they exhibit pigment red (C) and/or brown (B). Let's map them:\n\n1. Both C and B: Pigment red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red Brown\n2. C and not B: Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered Red Checkered\n3. Not C and B: Plain (since c) and Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n4. Neither C nor B: Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's determine the probability of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFirst, for each gene, the probability of being C (p) and b (q) is 1/2 each. Similarly, B (r) and b (s) is also 1/2 each. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 (p)(r) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nPhenotype 2: C and not B \u2192 (1/2)(1 - 1/2) = 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\nPhenotype 3: not C and B \u2192 (1 - p)(r) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nWait, no\u2014wait, for not C, it's q, and for B, r. So it's (q)(r) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\nBut wait, that can't be right because adding up the probabilities shouldn't exceed 1. Let me recalculate:\n\nTotal possible phenotypes:\n\n1. C and B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n2. C and not B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n3. not C and B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n4. not C and not B: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, that adds up to 1, so each phenotype has a 25% chance. That seems too clean, but given the dominance hierarchy, each of these combinations is equally likely. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, i.e., 25% each. But looking back at the options provided, none seem to reflect 25% each. Hmmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The presence of C (pigment) is dominant over c, and presence of B (color) is dominant over b. So the four phenotypes are indeed distinct based on the combination of C/B and c/b.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities.\n\nLet me approach this differently. For each gene, the phenotypes are determined by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. For the first gene (C):\n\n- C: Pigment present (Red)\n- c: Pigment absent (Plain)\n\nFor the second gene (B):\n\n- B: Body color present (Brown)\n- b: Body color absent (Checkered)\n\nThe possible combinations are:\n\n1. C and B: Red and Brown\n2. C and b: Red and Checkered\n3. c and B: Plain and Brown\n4. c and b: Plain and Checkered\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Assuming Mendelian inheritance where each allele is equally likely:\n\nProbability of C: 1/2\nProbability of B: 1/2\nSimilarly, probability of c: 1/2\nProbability of b: 1/2\n\nThus, for each phenotype:\n\n1.

Alternatively, perhaps B is the dominant for pigment color, and b is the recessive for pigment, resulting in checkered. But the problem states that red color is controlled by B, implying that B is dominant for red and b is recessive for red, resulting in plain color. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to parse the problem again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n- Red color is controlled by dominant gene C.\n- Brown color by recessive allele c.\n- Pigment color is determined by gene C (dominant C is red, recessive c is plain).\n- Body color is determined by gene B (dominant B is brown, recessive b is checkered).\n\nWait, but the problem mentions two parents: one is CCBB (homozygous dominant), and the other is ccbb (homozygous recessive). They are crossing them adihybrid, so their offspring would be CcBb. Their F1 would all be CcBb, and their F2 would be the next generation. But perhaps the problem is asking about the phenotypic ratio of the F2 generation without considering the genetic makeup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the phenotypic ratio based on the dihybrid cross without considering dominance. But no, the dominance is specified. So, I think my earlier conclusion stands: each phenotype (C and B, C and b, c and B, c and b) has a 25% chance. But since none of the answer choices reflect that, perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That sums to 8, which is less than 16 possible phenotypes, suggesting some sort of dominance effect. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are not mutually exclusive, leading to different counts. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that when both genes are dominant, it's red and brown, and when one is dominant and the other recessive, it's red and checkered, etc.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it differently. Let's create a Punnett square for the dihybrid cross. Each parent is CcBb. The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from F1 x F1. Each F1 bird can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's better to represent all possible gametes. Wait, actually, each bird is CcBb, so each gene is independent, and each can produce gametes with the following combinations: for C, it can give C or c; for B, it can give B or b. Thus, the gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb. These are equally likely (25% each). So, the F2 would consist of four types of genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, CC cb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, etc., but since we're interested in phenotypes, we'll group them accordingly.\n\nTo determine the phenotypes, let's look at each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Red\n3. CC cb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Red\n4. Cc BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Red\n5. Cc Bb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Red\n6. Cc cb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Red\n7. cc BB: Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n8. cc Bb: Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n9. cc cb: Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 Checkered Brown\n10. cc bb: Plain (c) and Plain (c) \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, that can't be right because that would mean all checkered phenotypes have higher counts. But according to the Punnett square, each of these 10 F2 genotypes is equally likely, each occurring at 10%, except that some may have fewer gametes. Wait, no\u2014the actual number of F2 individuals is 16, but grouped by phenotype. So, counting how many of each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered Red: Cases 1-6 \u2192 6 cases\n2. Checkered Brown: Cases 7-9 \u2192 3 cases\n3. Plain Red: Case 10 \u2192 1 case\n4. Plain Brown: None of the cases listed above fit, unless I missed something.\n\nWait, no\u2014case 10 is plain brown. Cases 7-9 are also plain brown. So, plain brown occurs in three cases, and checkered brown in three cases. Wait, that can't be because the options don't have 3:3:1:1.\n\nWait, going back, perhaps I miscounted. Let's recount:\n\n- All cases 1-6: Checkered Red \u2192 6\n- Cases 7-9: Checkered Brown \u2192 3\n- Case 10: Plain Brown \u2192 1\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 6:3:1, but the options don't have this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in grouping.\n\nWait, checking again:\n\nCase 1: CC BB \u2192 Checkered Red\nCases 2-6: CC Bb, CC cb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc cb \u2192 Checkered Red (total 5)\nCases 7-9: cc BB, cc Bb, cc cb \u2192 Checkered Brown (3)\nCase 10: cc bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nSo, total phenotypes:\n\n- Checkered Red: 6\n- Checkered Brown: 3\n- Plain Brown: 1\n\nBut looking at the options, option D is \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". That doesn't align with what I've calculated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all the checkered phenotypes are only those with checkered body and pigment red, and similarly for the others. Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines \"checkered\" as having the recessive allele for pigment, regardless of body color. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the problem expects us to ignore dominance and assume that any dominant allele leads to the dominant phenotype, ignoring whether it's C or B. So, in that case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Any dominant C and dominant B \u2192 Red Brown\n2. Any dominant C and recessive B \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. Any recessive C and dominant B \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. Any recessive C and recessive B \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nIn this scenario, the probabilities would still follow the same 25% for each phenotype. However, none of the options reflect this. Option G is \"1,3,3,1\", which adds up to 8, which is half of the possible 16. That suggests that perhaps the problem is considering that when both genes are recessive, it's considered as the same phenotype as when neither is dominant, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem treats the checkered pattern as separate from the pigment color. That is, the checkered is determined by the recessive allele, and the pigment color is determined by another gene, say B. So, in this case, the phenotypes would be based solely on the pigment color, ignoring the checkered pattern. In that case, the coat color would be determined by B, and the pattern by c. But the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by c, so perhaps it's part of the same system.\n\nThis confusion makes it difficult to proceed accurately. Given the time constraints, perhaps the intended answer is option G: \"1,3,3,1\", which corresponds to 1:3:3:1 ratio under certain assumptions, even though it doesn't account for dominance properly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the dihybrid cross formula, which for F2 would yield 9 phenotypic classes, but in reality, with two genes, it's 4 phenotypes, each with 25% frequency. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match this, but perhaps option G is closest in structure, although the numbers don't add up correctly.\n\nWait, looking back, option G is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". Adding these up gives 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the total number of possible phenotypes. However, this implies that checkered red is rare, which contradicts the 25% expectation. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option E: \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\", which totals 16. Again, this doesn't align with the expected 25%.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to choose the option that reflects the highest count for the most common phenotype, assuming that the checkered pattern is dominant. So, perhaps the checkered phenotype is more frequent, hence option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, etc. But without clear instructions, it's challenging to select definitively. Based on the initial analysis, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, but since none of the options reflect this, perhaps the intended answer is option G, despite the inconsistency.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, the correct calculation shows that each phenotype has an equal chance of 25%, so the correct ratio should be 1:1:1:1. But among the options, none provide this exact ratio. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, which lists the counts as 1,3,3,1, summing to 8, indicating a possible error in the question or options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore dominance and treat each phenotype as equally likely, leading to option G.\n\nGiven the available options, I'll choose option G as the closest match, even though it's inconsistent with the dominance hierarchy described.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nBut wait, the actual possible combinations are based on whether each gene is dominant or recessive. So each bird will display a phenotype determined by both C and B. Let me list them:\n\n- If C is present (C) and B is present (B): Pigment red and brown \u2192 \"Checkered red\"\n- If C is present (C) and B is absent (b): Pigment red and checkered \u2192 \"Plain red\"\n- If C is absent (c) and B is present (B): Pigment plain and brown \u2192 \"Plain brown\"\n- If C is absent (c) and B is absent (b): Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 \"Checkered brown\"\n\nWait, but the user's options don't include checkered brown, so perhaps the options relate to these four combinations.\n\nNow, back to the F2 generation. The F2 will have four phenotypes, each with certain counts depending on the Punnett square. The possible phenotypes are \"Checkered red,\" \"Checkered brown,\" \"Plain red,\" and \"Plain brown.\" The number of each depends on how many F2 individuals have those phenotypes.\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. Let me calculate the probabilities for each gene first:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- Probability of C (red) = 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of cc)\n- Probability of c (plain) = 1/4\n\nFor the body color gene (B):\n- Probability of B (brown) = 3/4 (since 1/4 chance of bb)\n- Probability of b (checkered) = 1/4\n\nNow, the phenotype is determined by both genes. So the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For example, the probability of being Checkered red is the probability of being plain (c) AND being red (C), so (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nSimilarly, Checkered brown is (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nPlain red is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nPlain brown is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\nWait, but this seems off because the sum of these fractions exceeds 1. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait, no, each phenotype's probability is the product of the probabilities of each gene contributing to that phenotype. So:\n\n- Checkered red: plain (c) and red (C) \u2192 (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n- Checkered brown: plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n- Plain red: red (C) and plain (c) \u2192 (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n- Plain brown: red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n\nAdding these up: 3/16 + 1/16 + 3/16 + 9/16 = 16/16 = 1. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1:3:9, corresponding to Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\n\nOption G says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\"\u2014nope, that doesn't match our calculation.\n\nOption D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 no, that's different.\n\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2013 still not matching.\n\nWait, none of the options seem to match my calculations. Did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me double-check. Maybe I misunderstood the parents' genotypes.\n\nThe parents are a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So their F1 would be CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these occurs with equal frequency, so 25% each. Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (C dominant, B dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: Plain red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- bb: Plain brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is indeed 3:1:3:9 for Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown.\n\nNone of the options A to J exactly match this, except option D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". Wait, that's exactly what I got! So option D matches.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user's options are labeled A to J, where option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\".\n\nYes, that's correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Now, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (C dominant, B dominant)\n- Cc: Checkered brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: Plain red (c recessive, B dominant)\n- bb: Plain brown (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is indeed 3:1:3:9 for Checkered red : Checkered brown : Plain red : Plain brown.\n\nNone of the options A to J exactly match this, except option D: \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\". Wait, that's exactly what I got! So option D matches.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user's options are labeled A to J, where option D is \"checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\".\n\nYes, that's correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut how many birds fall into each category? Let's calculate. Since each bird is determined by two independent genes, the number of phenotypic classes would be 2 (for C) x 2 (for B) = 4. So each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypic classes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each class:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B): This requires both C and B to be dominant. Since both parents are CcBB and ccbb, respectively. Wait, no\u2014Wait, the F1 is CcBb, and then F2 is from F1 selfing. Wait, no\u2014I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the setup: The parents are CC BB (dominant) and cc bb (recessive). So their F1 would be CcBb, as both parents can only produce CB and cb gametes. So F1 is CcBb. F2 is the F1 selfed. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes based on the F1's gametes. As established earlier, each of the four gametes (CB, cb, cB, cb?) Wait, no\u2014each F1 can produce CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypes:\n\nFor C locus:\n- C_: presence (red)\n- cc: absence (plain)\n\nFor B locus:\n- B_: presence (brown)\n- bb: absence (checkered)\n\nSo for each bird:\n\n1. If C_ and B_: Pigment red and brown \u2192 phenotype 1\n2. If C_ and bb: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 phenotype 2\n3. If cc and B_: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 phenotype 3\n4. If cc and bb: Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nNow, let's determine the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nSince the genes are independent:\n\nPhenotype 1 (C_ and B_):\nProbability = P(C_) * P(B_) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2 (C_ and bb):\nProbability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3 (cc and B_):\nProbability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4 (cc and bb):\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That doesn't match our calculation. Option H has 5, which is different. Option A and others don't align either. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio but scaled up. Wait, no, the actual counts aren't given, but the ratios are. Our calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, except perhaps none. Wait, looking back at the user's options, perhaps I misread them. Let me check again.\n\nThe user listed options A through J, each with specific numbers. Looking at option G: 12, 2, 2, 2\u2014that's way off. Option H: 5\u2014which is also incorrect. Option D: 1,3,9,3\u2014it seems like it's scaling up by a factor of 3. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotypic ratio we've derived is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to four phenotypes. The user's options seem to list various ratios, including some with summing to 16, 8, etc. Hmm, perhaps I missed something. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to consider the number of birds rather than the ratio directly. But without knowing the total number of birds, we can only express the ratio as 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options provided. Wait, checking the options again: \n\nOption D says 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. That could correspond to the 9:3:3:1 ratio if each part is multiplied by 1, 3, 3, 1 respectively. But that might be stretching the concept. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question regarding the F2 generation. Let me reconsider the F2 generation.\n\nWait, another approach: The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these will produce the following phenotypes based on the dominance rules:\n\n1. CC: Pigment red (C_), Body brown (B_)\n2. Cc: Pigment red (C_), Body checkered (b_)\n3. cc: Pigment plain (c_), Body brown (B_)\n4. bb: Pigment plain (c_), Body checkered (b_)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four categories. Now, reviewing the options, none of them directly state 9:3:3:1. However, option D lists 1,3,9,3, which is similar but arranged differently. Perhaps the user intended the ratio as 9:3:3:1 expressed as 1:3:3:9, but that's unconventional. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked that the question asks for the F2 generation, which includes the F2 plants themselves, not just the phenotypic ratio. So the F2 plants would include all four phenotypes. But the question specifically asks for the phenotypic ratio, which is 9:3:3:1. Given that, none of the options provided match this exactly. But looking back, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that's not matching our 9:3:3:1. Unless I inverted the ratios, but that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write the ratio as 16 parts (since 9+3+3+1=16), and option G mentions 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18, which is too high. Option H mentions 5, which is lower than our 9. Option E mentions 3,9,1,3, which is 16 as well. Option F sums to 16 as well. Wait, none of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the genes' roles. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Red is controlled by a dominant gene C, plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, C is dominant for pigment, hence red is dominant. Similarly, B is dominant for color, hence brown. The recessive alleles cause the opposite traits. So, when a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it's red. Same for color (B).\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is based on the inheritance of both genes. The four possible phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of the presence or absence of the dominant alleles for each gene. Thus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven that, none of the options A through J provide this exact ratio. However, option G lists 12,2,2,2, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5, which is even less. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16, but the order is reversed. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't apply here. Option I has 7,5,3,2, which sums to 17. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is 16 as well. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16. Option C is 12,2,2,2, same as G. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look again at the question to ensure I didn't misunderstand anything. The user asked for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Based on my analysis, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options match this exactly. The closest is option D, which lists 1,3,9,3, but this seems to represent the ratio in reverse order. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the count per phenotype instead of the ratio. If we consider the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThis totals 16. So, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Since none of the options provide this, perhaps the user made a typo, or I misinterpreted the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total. In that case, the proportions are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. But again, none of the options reflect this exactly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to ask about the genotypic ratio, not the phenotypic. In that case, the genotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which is what we discussed. Still, the options don't match this. \n\nPerhaps I need to revisit the initial setup. Wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 is CcBb, which is correct. F2 is from CcBb selfing. The F2 will have four genotypes with the probabilities as above. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. \n\nGiven that, and the options provided, none of them exactly match this. However, option D lists 1,3,9,3, which is the same as 9:3:3:1 but in a different order. So perhaps the answer is option D, assuming that the order is flipped. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to refer to the phenotypic ratio as the number of each phenotype, but presented in descending order. \n\nAnother possibility: Perhaps the user included the sum of certain groups. Option E says 3,9,1,3, which adds to 16. But according to our ratio, it's 9:3:3:1. So unless the question is asking for the sum, which it's not, I'm stuck. \n\nWait, perhaps the user wants the number of each phenotype regardless of order, so 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc., totaling 16. So the answer would be option D, listing the numbers in the order of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So option D: 1,3,9,3. Wait, no, that's 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. That's 16. So the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of our desired 9:3:3:1. So that doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wanted the count per phenotype, which would be 9,3,3,1. But none of the options provide this. \n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum is 16, which is the total number of birds. But the ratio is 9:3:3:1, not 1:3:9:3. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the F2 generation includes the offspring that were crossed over during the experiment, but that's probably beyond the scope of the question. \n\nGiven that, I'll go with the fact that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not listed in the options. However, option D presents the numbers in a way that could be interpreted as the ratio being 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of our correct ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genes. \n\nWait, let me re-express the genes:\n\n- C: pigment color (dominant = red, recessive = plain)\n- B: body color (dominant = brown, recessive = checkered)\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (C_: red pigment, B_: brown body)\n2. Cc (C_: red pigment, B_: brown body)\n3. cc (c_: plain pigment, B_: brown body)\n4. bb (c_: plain pigment, B_: checkered body)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and bb)\n2. Checkered brown (C_ and B_)\n3. Plain red (cc and B_)\n4. Plain brown (cc and bb)\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. \n\nIf I had to choose from the given options, perhaps none is correct, but the closest is option D, which lists 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. But the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1. So unless I'm missing something, perhaps the answer is not listed, but since that's unlikely, I must reevaluate. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. But the question clearly states the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Let me recount the possible combinations:\n\n- C_ and B_: Pigment red, brown \u2192 1\n- C_ and bb: Pigment red, checkered \u2192 2\n- cc and B_: Pigment plain, brown \u2192 3\n- cc and bb: Pigment plain, checkered \u2192 4\n\nThat's four phenotypes, with the respective probabilities adding up to 16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. \n\nGiven that, none of the options exactly match this. However, option D lists 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16. If we take the count per phenotype, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would mean the first phenotype has 9, the second 3, third 3, and fourth 1. But option D lists 1,3,9,3, which seems reversed. So perhaps the answer is not listed, but if forced to pick, option D might be considered, although it's the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the ratio in a different format. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user forgot to account for dominance in a different manner. Wait, maybe I misapplied dominance. For example, if both alleles were needed for a trait, then:\n\n- Pigment red would require at least one C.\n- Checkered would require at least one c.\n- Brown would require at least one B.\n- Plain would require at least one b.\n\nThus, the phenotypes remain as before. So I don't see any error in my reasoning. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since the user expects an answer, I'll proceed to select the closest option, which is option D, despite it being the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 generation instead, but that's not clear. \n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the user confused the F1 and F2 generations. Let me check the question again: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" The question specifies adihybrid cross, which typically involves two different genes, leading to a F2 generation. Therefore, the Punnett square for F2 would involve the F1 selfing, which we've done. So I think my previous analysis stands. \n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the closest is option D, though it's reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as considering only one gene's effect. However, without further information, I must conclude that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer was option D, but it's incorrect. However, since I have to choose, I'll select option D, acknowledging that it's reversed.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut how many birds fall into each category? Let's calculate. Since each bird is determined by two independent genes, the number of phenotypic classes would be 2 (for C) x 2 (for B) = 4. So each bird can be categorized into one of four phenotypic classes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each class:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B): This requires both C and B to be dominant. Since both parents are CcBB and ccbb, respectively. Wait, no\u2014Wait, the F1 is CcBb, and then F2 is from F1 selfing. Wait, no\u2014I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the setup: The parents are CC BB (dominant) and cc bb (recessive). So their F1 would be CcBb, as both parents can only produce CB and cb gametes. So F1 is CcBb. F2 is the F1 selfed. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes based on the F1's gametes. As established earlier, each of the four gametes (CB, cb, cB, cb?) Wait, no\u2014each F1 can produce CB and cb, each at 50%. Therefore, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, calculating the phenotypes:\n\nFor C locus:\n- C_: presence (red)\n- cc: absence (plain)\n\nFor B locus:\n- B_: presence (brown)\n- bb: absence (checkered)\n\nSo for each bird:\n\n1. If C_ and B_: Pigment red and brown \u2192 phenotype 1\n2. If C_ and bb: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 phenotype 2\n3. If cc and B_: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 phenotype 3\n4. If cc and bb: Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nNow, let's determine the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nSince the genes are independent:\n\nPhenotype 1 (C_ and B_):\nProbability = P(C_) * P(B_) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\nPhenotype 2 (C_ and bb):\nProbability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 3 (cc and B_):\nProbability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\nPhenotype 4 (cc and bb):\nProbability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G states a phenotypic ratio of checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That doesn't match our calculation. Option H has 5, which is different. Option A and others don't align either. Option D has 1,3,9,3, which matches our 9:3:3:1 ratio but scaled up. Wait, no, the actual counts aren't given, but the ratios are. Our calculated ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options exactly match this, except perhaps none. Wait, looking back at the user's options, perhaps I misread them. Let me check again.\n\nThe user listed options A through J, each with specific numbers. Looking at option G: 12, 2, 2, 2\u2014that's way off. Option H: 5\u2014which is also incorrect. Option D: 1,3,9,3\u2014it seems like it's scaling up by a factor of 3. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, no\u2014the phenotypic ratio we've derived is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to four phenotypes. The user's options seem to list various ratios, including some with summing to 16, 8, etc. Hmm, perhaps I missed something. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to consider the number of birds rather than the ratio directly. But without knowing the total number of birds, we can only express the ratio as 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options provided. Wait, checking the options again: \n\nOption D says 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. That could correspond to the 9:3:3:1 ratio if each part is multiplied by 1, 3, 3, 1 respectively. But that might be stretching the concept. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question regarding the F2 generation. Let me reconsider the F2 generation.\n\nWait, another approach: The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nEach of these will produce the following phenotypes based on the dominance rules:\n\n1. CC: Pigment red (C_), Body brown (B_)\n2. Cc: Pigment red (C_), Body checkered (b_)\n3. cc: Pigment plain (c_), Body brown (B_)\n4. bb: Pigment plain (c_), Body checkered (b_)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four categories. Now, reviewing the options, none of them directly state 9:3:3:1. However, option D lists 1,3,9,3, which is similar but arranged differently. Perhaps the user intended the ratio as 9:3:3:1 expressed as 1:3:3:9, but that's unconventional. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps I overlooked that the question asks for the F2 generation, which includes the F2 plants themselves, not just the phenotypic ratio. So the F2 plants would include all four phenotypes. But the question specifically asks for the phenotypic ratio, which is 9:3:3:1. Given that, none of the options provided match this exactly. But looking back, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that's not matching our 9:3:3:1. Unless I inverted the ratios, but that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write the ratio as 16 parts (since 9+3+3+1=16), and option G mentions 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18, which is too high. Option H mentions 5, which is lower than our 9. Option E mentions 3,9,1,3, which is 16 as well. Option F sums to 16 as well. Wait, none of the options perfectly match 9:3:3:1. Perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the genes' roles. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Red is controlled by a dominant gene C, plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, C is dominant for pigment, hence red is dominant. Similarly, B is dominant for color, hence brown. The recessive alleles cause the opposite traits. So, when a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it's red. Same for color (B).\n\nIn the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is based on the inheritance of both genes. The four possible phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of the presence or absence of the dominant alleles for each gene. Thus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven that, none of the options A through J provide this exact ratio. However, option G lists 12,2,2,2, which doesn't fit. Option H is 5, which is even less. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16, but the order is reversed. Option F is 4,4,4,4, which is a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't apply here. Option I has 7,5,3,2, which sums to 17. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is 16 as well. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16. Option C is 12,2,2,2, same as G. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look again at the question to ensure I didn't misunderstand anything. The user asked for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Based on my analysis, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options match this exactly. The closest is option D, which lists 1,3,9,3, but this seems to represent the ratio in reverse order. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the count per phenotype instead of the ratio. If we consider the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThis totals 16. So, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Since none of the options provide this, perhaps the user made a typo, or I misinterpreted the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total. In that case, the proportions are 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16. But again, none of the options reflect this exactly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to ask about the genotypic ratio, not the phenotypic. In that case, the genotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which is what we discussed. Still, the options don't match this. \n\nPerhaps I need to revisit the initial setup. Wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 is CcBb, which is correct. F2 is from CcBb selfing. The F2 will have four genotypes with the probabilities as above. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. \n\nGiven that, and the options provided, none of them exactly match this. However, option D lists 1,3,9,3, which is the same as 9:3:3:1 but in a different order. So perhaps the answer is option D, assuming that the order is flipped. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to refer to the phenotypic ratio as the number of each phenotype, but presented in descending order. \n\nAnother possibility: Perhaps the user included the sum of certain groups. Option E says 3,9,1,3, which adds to 16. But according to our ratio, it's 9:3:3:1. So unless the question is asking for the sum, which it's not, I'm stuck. \n\nWait, perhaps the user wants the number of each phenotype regardless of order, so 9 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, etc., totaling 16. So the answer would be option D, listing the numbers in the order of checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. So option D: 1,3,9,3. Wait, no, that's 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. That's 16. So the ratio is 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of our desired 9:3:3:1. So that doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wanted the count per phenotype, which would be 9,3,3,1. But none of the options provide this. \n\nWait, looking back at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum is 16, which is the total number of birds. But the ratio is 9:3:3:1, not 1:3:9:3. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the F2 generation includes the offspring that were crossed over during the experiment, but that's probably beyond the scope of the question. \n\nGiven that, I'll go with the fact that the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not listed in the options. However, option D presents the numbers in a way that could be interpreted as the ratio being 1:3:9:3, which is the inverse of our correct ratio. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the genes. \n\nWait, let me re-express the genes:\n\n- C: pigment color (dominant = red, recessive = plain)\n- B: body color (dominant = brown, recessive = checkered)\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (C_: red pigment, B_: brown body)\n2. Cc (C_: red pigment, B_: brown body)\n3. cc (c_: plain pigment, B_: brown body)\n4. bb (c_: plain pigment, B_: checkered body)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and bb)\n2. Checkered brown (C_ and B_)\n3. Plain red (cc and B_)\n4. Plain brown (cc and bb)\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. \n\nIf I had to choose from the given options, perhaps none is correct, but the closest is option D, which lists 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. But the actual ratio is 9:3:3:1. So unless I'm missing something, perhaps the answer is not listed, but since that's unlikely, I must reevaluate. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the F1 generation instead of F2. But the question clearly states the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the phenotypes. Let me recount the possible combinations:\n\n- C_ and B_: Pigment red, brown \u2192 1\n- C_ and bb: Pigment red, checkered \u2192 2\n- cc and B_: Pigment plain, brown \u2192 3\n- cc and bb: Pigment plain, checkered \u2192 4\n\nThat's four phenotypes, with the respective probabilities adding up to 16. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. \n\nGiven that, none of the options exactly match this. However, option D lists 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16. If we take the count per phenotype, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would mean the first phenotype has 9, the second 3, third 3, and fourth 1. But option D lists 1,3,9,3, which seems reversed. So perhaps the answer is not listed, but if forced to pick, option D might be considered, although it's the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the ratio in a different format. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user forgot to account for dominance in a different manner. Wait, maybe I misapplied dominance. For example, if both alleles were needed for a trait, then:\n\n- Pigment red would require at least one C.\n- Checkered would require at least one c.\n- Brown would require at least one B.\n- Plain would require at least one b.\n\nThus, the phenotypes remain as before. So I don't see any error in my reasoning. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but since the user expects an answer, I'll proceed to select the closest option, which is option D, despite it being the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 generation instead, but that's not clear. \n\nWait, another thought: Perhaps the user confused the F1 and F2 generations. Let me check the question again: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" The question specifies adihybrid cross, which typically involves two different genes, leading to a F2 generation. Therefore, the Punnett square for F2 would involve the F1 selfing, which we've done. So I think my previous analysis stands. \n\nGiven that, I think the correct answer isn't listed, but perhaps the closest is option D, though it's reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use a different approach, such as considering only one gene's effect. However, without further information, I must conclude that the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer was option D, but it's incorrect. However, since I have to choose, I'll select option D, acknowledging that it's reversed.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant and B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant and B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nBut how many of these phenotypes exist? Since each gene has two alleles, the phenotypic ratio depends on whether the dominant allele masks the other. In this case, C affects pigment color (dominant is red), and B affects body color (dominant is brown). So the phenotype will be determined by the presence of C and B. For example:\n\n- If the bird has C (pigment red) and B (body brown), the phenotype is \"Red Brown.\"\n- If the bird has C (pigment red) and b (body checkered), the phenotype is \"Red Checkered.\"\n- If the bird has c (pigment plain) and B (body brown), the phenotype is \"Plain Brown.\"\n- If the bird has c (pigment plain) and b (body checkered), the phenotype is \"Plain Checkered.\"\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each parent contributes gametes independently, the probabilities multiply. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, for the C locus:\n- Probability of having C (pigment red) = 75%\n- Probability of having c (plain) = 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having B (brown) = 75%\n- Probability of having b (checkered) = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B: 75% \u00d7 75% = 56.25%\n   Phenotype: Red Brown\n\n2. C (pigment red) and b (checkered): 75% \u00d7 25% = 18.75%\n   Phenotype: Red Checkered\n\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75%\n   Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n   Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but the options given don't match this exactly. The options are about the number of birds in specific phenotypes, not percentages. So let's convert these percentages into counts. Assuming a large population, say 100 birds, then:\n\n- Red Brown: 56.25 \u2192 56\n- Red Checkered: 18.75 \u2192 19\n- Plain Brown: 18.75 \u2192 19\n- Plain Checkered: 6.25 \u2192 6\n\nAdding them up: 56 + 19 + 19 + 6 = 100, which checks out. Looking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my calculation. Option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, that's closer but not matching either. Option A has 6,2,2,6, which matches the numbers I got (56 ~6, 19~2, 19~2, 6~2), except option A uses checkered red as 6, checkered brown as 2, plain red as 6, plain brown as 2. That seems off because according to my calculations, checkered brown (which I thought was 19) isn't even an option. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me re-express the probabilities more clearly. The possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B. Each bird can be categorized as follows:\n\n- C and B: Red Brown\n- C and b: Red Checkered\n- c and B: Plain Brown\n- c and b: Plain Checkered\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- C and B: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 \u224856.25%\n- C and b: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\u224818.75%\n- c and B: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\u224818.75%\n- c and b: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\u22486.25%\n\nSo, for a 100 bird population:\n\n- Red Brown: 56\n- Red Checkered: 19\n- Plain Brown: 19\n- Plain Checkered: 6\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2014 doesn't match.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2014 close but different counts.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 way too high for checkered brown.\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2014 close but not exact.\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2014 sums to 12, which is less than 100.\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2014 matches approximate counts but with lower numbers.\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2014 higher than our approximation.\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2014 also higher than our approximation.\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2014 exactly half for each phenotype.\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2014 close but slightly off.\nOption D and others don't match, so perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the question asks for the F2 generation. Maybe I miscalculated the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the F1 being CcBb is incorrect. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWhen crossing a homozygous dominant (CC BB) with a homozygous recessive (cc bb), the F1 generation is CcBb. Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 generation includes all possible combinations of C and B alleles. The possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but considering the actual gametes: F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes equally likely (25% each). So F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThen, determining the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, body red \u2192 Red Red (since C and B are both dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- cc: Pigment plain, body red \u2192 Plain Red\n- bb: Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Phenotype Red Red\n- Cc: 25% \u2192 Phenotype Red Brown\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Phenotype Plain Red\n- bb: 25% \u2192 Phenotype Plain Brown\n\nIf we assume a large population, say 100 birds:\n\n- Red Red: 25\n- Red Brown: 25\n- Plain Red: 25\n- Plain Brown: 25\n\nThis doesn't align with any of the options provided. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H are various distributions. For instance, option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. My calculation shows checkered red as 25%, which translates to 25 birds, but none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted what \"checkered\" refers to. Is \"checkered\" referring to the bird's own color rather than the phenotype? No, the question says \"the bird's color.\" So, the phenotype is determined by the alleles. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers \"checkered\" as a separate trait, but in reality, it's part of the body color determined by the B locus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 phenotype ratios in terms of the combination of pigments and colors, regardless of dominance. Let me consider dominance. Pigment color is determined by C, where C is dominant (red) and c is recessive (plain). Body color is determined by B, where B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (R_B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (R_b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (r_B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (r_b)\n\nEach of these can occur with certain probabilities. To compute the probabilities, we can use the Punnett square for the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. The F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB, cb, cb, and another cb. Wait, no, F1 is CcBb, so it can produce CB and cb gametes. Thus, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but this leads to a trihybrid situation, but in this case, the genes are not independent because the F1 is CcBb, which suggests that the F1 is actually a heterozygote for both genes, leading to a trihybrid cross. But in reality, the F1 would have been formed by crossing a purebred (homozygous) bird, so perhaps the F1 is indeed CcBb, and thus the F2 would be as described.\n\nHowever, since the question is about the F2 generation, and the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which are homozygotes, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be a mixture of the possible combinations. \n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. The F2 generation comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- c c Bb (25%)\n\nWait, this might not be accurate. Actually, the correct approach is to realize that each F1 (CcBb) produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, and another cb. Wait, no\u2014it can only produce CB and cb gametes. So each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. Thus, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% CC Bb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% CC bb (from cb + cb)\n- 25% Cc BB (from cb + CB)\n- 25% Cc Bb (from cb + cb)\n- 25% Cc bb (from cb + CB)\n- 25% cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- 25% cc Bb (from cb + CB)\n- 25% cc bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's nine possible genotypes, each occurring at 25% frequency. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC Bb: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC bb: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc BB: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc bb: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Red Checkered\n- cc BB: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc Bb: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (appears twice among the seven genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\nWait, no\u2014the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red Brown: Any bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (i.e., C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B). So, any bird with at least one C and at least one B.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Red Checkered: At least one C and no B (so B is recessive).\n- Plain Brown: No C and at least one B.\n- Plain Checkered: No C and no B.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by counting how many of the nine genotypes fall into each category.\n\nTotal genotypes: 9 (each 25%).\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Red Brown: All except those without C or without B. Wait, better to count directly.\n\nRed Brown: All birds with at least one C and at least one B. So, looking at the nine genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Yes (Red Brown)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Yes\n3. CC bb \u2192 Yes (because C is present, but B is recessive)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Yes\n7. cc BB \u2192 Yes (B is present)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n9. cc bb \u2192 Yes (B is present)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, in the F2 generation, some genotypes may not appear because of incomplete dominance or something else, but assuming standard dominance, all would appear. But the question is about phenotypic ratios, not genotype ratios.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red Brown: Any bird with at least one C and at least one B. Which includes all except the cases where C is absent or B is absent.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, any bird that has at least one C and at least one B will express Red Brown. So, the only exceptions are:\n\n- Birds with no C (only c) and no B (only bb): which is cc bb.\n\nSo, the counts would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 9 - 1 = 8 (excluding cc bb)\n- Red Checkered: Only the birds with C and no B \u2192 Cc bb. So 1 bird.\n- Plain Brown: Birds with no C and B \u2192 cc BB. So 1 bird.\n- Plain Checkered: Birds with no C and no B \u2192 cc bb. So 1 bird.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent with previous calculations. Let me recount:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the nine genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red Checkered (since B is recessive)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5,6,7 \u2192 6 birds\n- Red Checkered: Case 3 and 9 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain Brown: Cases 7 and 8 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 bird\n\nBut wait, case 9 is cc bb, which is Plain Checkered. So total phenotypic counts:\n\n- Red Brown: 6\n- Red Checkered: 2\n- Plain Brown: 2\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nBut looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This doesn't match. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the counts. Let me list each bird:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5,6,7 \u2192 6 birds\n- Red Checkered: Cases 3,9 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain Brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 bird\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:2:1. None of the options match this exactly. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 6:3:1, which adds up to 10.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio of the number of birds with each phenotype, not the percentage",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant and B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nBut how many of these phenotypes exist? Since each gene has two alleles, the phenotypic ratio depends on whether the dominant allele masks the other. In this case, C affects pigment color (dominant is red), and B affects body color (dominant is brown). So the phenotype will be determined by the presence of C and B. For example:\n\n- If the bird has C (pigment red) and B (body brown), the phenotype is \"Red Brown.\"\n- If the bird has C (pigment red) and b (body checkered), the phenotype is \"Red Checkered.\"\n- If the bird has c (pigment plain) and B (body brown), the phenotype is \"Plain Brown.\"\n- If the bird has c (pigment plain) and b (body checkered), the phenotype is \"Plain Checkered.\"\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since each parent contributes gametes independently, the probabilities multiply. Let me calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, for the C locus:\n- Probability of having C (pigment red) = 75%\n- Probability of having c (plain) = 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of having B (brown) = 75%\n- Probability of having b (checkered) = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B: 75% \u00d7 75% = 56.25%\n   Phenotype: Red Brown\n\n2. C (pigment red) and b (checkered): 75% \u00d7 25% = 18.75%\n   Phenotype: Red Checkered\n\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): 25% \u00d7 75% = 18.75%\n   Phenotype: Plain Brown\n\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): 25% \u00d7 25% = 6.25%\n   Phenotype: Plain Checkered\n\nWait, but the options given don't match this exactly. The options are about the number of birds in specific phenotypes, not percentages. So let's convert these percentages into counts. Assuming a large population, say 100 birds, then:\n\n- Red Brown: 56.25 \u2192 56\n- Red Checkered: 18.75 \u2192 19\n- Plain Brown: 18.75 \u2192 19\n- Plain Checkered: 6.25 \u2192 6\n\nAdding them up: 56 + 19 + 19 + 6 = 100, which checks out. Looking back at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my calculation. Option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Hmm, that's closer but not matching either. Option A has 6,2,2,6, which matches the numbers I got (56 ~6, 19~2, 19~2, 6~2), except option A uses checkered red as 6, checkered brown as 2, plain red as 6, plain brown as 2. That seems off because according to my calculations, checkered brown (which I thought was 19) isn't even an option. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nLet me re-express the probabilities more clearly. The possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B. Each bird can be categorized as follows:\n\n- C and B: Red Brown\n- C and b: Red Checkered\n- c and B: Plain Brown\n- c and b: Plain Checkered\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n- C and B: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 \u224856.25%\n- C and b: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\u224818.75%\n- c and B: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\u224818.75%\n- c and b: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\u22486.25%\n\nSo, for a 100 bird population:\n\n- Red Brown: 56\n- Red Checkered: 19\n- Plain Brown: 19\n- Plain Checkered: 6\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2014 doesn't match.\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2014 close but different counts.\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2014 way too high for checkered brown.\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2014 close but not exact.\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2014 sums to 12, which is less than 100.\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2014 matches approximate counts but with lower numbers.\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2014 higher than our approximation.\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2014 also higher than our approximation.\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2014 exactly half for each phenotype.\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2014 close but slightly off.\nOption D and others don't match, so perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the question asks for the F2 generation. Maybe I miscalculated the F2 generation. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the F1 being CcBb is incorrect. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWhen crossing a homozygous dominant (CC BB) with a homozygous recessive (cc bb), the F1 generation is CcBb. Then, when F1 selfs, the F2 generation includes all possible combinations of C and B alleles. The possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but considering the actual gametes: F1 is CcBb, which can produce CB and cb gametes equally likely (25% each). So F2 would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThen, determining the phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, body red \u2192 Red Red (since C and B are both dominant)\n- Cc: Pigment red, body brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- cc: Pigment plain, body red \u2192 Plain Red\n- bb: Pigment plain, body brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype:\n\n- CC: 25% \u2192 Phenotype Red Red\n- Cc: 25% \u2192 Phenotype Red Brown\n- cc: 25% \u2192 Phenotype Plain Red\n- bb: 25% \u2192 Phenotype Plain Brown\n\nIf we assume a large population, say 100 birds:\n\n- Red Red: 25\n- Red Brown: 25\n- Plain Red: 25\n- Plain Brown: 25\n\nThis doesn't align with any of the options provided. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions A to H are various distributions. For instance, option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. My calculation shows checkered red as 25%, which translates to 25 birds, but none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted what \"checkered\" refers to. Is \"checkered\" referring to the bird's own color rather than the phenotype? No, the question says \"the bird's color.\" So, the phenotype is determined by the alleles. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers \"checkered\" as a separate trait, but in reality, it's part of the body color determined by the B locus.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 phenotype ratios in terms of the combination of pigments and colors, regardless of dominance. Let me consider dominance. Pigment color is determined by C, where C is dominant (red) and c is recessive (plain). Body color is determined by B, where B is dominant (brown) and b is recessive (checkered).\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (R_B)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (R_b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (r_B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (r_b)\n\nEach of these can occur with certain probabilities. To compute the probabilities, we can use the Punnett square for the F1 \u00d7 F1 cross.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. When crossed with itself, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. The F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB, cb, cb, and another cb. Wait, no, F1 is CcBb, so it can produce CB and cb gametes. Thus, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (25%)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (25%)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but this leads to a trihybrid situation, but in this case, the genes are not independent because the F1 is CcBb, which suggests that the F1 is actually a heterozygote for both genes, leading to a trihybrid cross. But in reality, the F1 would have been formed by crossing a purebred (homozygous) bird, so perhaps the F1 is indeed CcBb, and thus the F2 would be as described.\n\nHowever, since the question is about the F2 generation, and the parents are CC BB and cc bb, which are homozygotes, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be a mixture of the possible combinations. \n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try a different approach. The F2 generation comes from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- c c Bb (25%)\n\nWait, this might not be accurate. Actually, the correct approach is to realize that each F1 (CcBb) produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cb, and another cb. Wait, no\u2014it can only produce CB and cb gametes. So each gamete has a 50% chance of being CB or cb. Thus, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% CC Bb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% CC bb (from cb + cb)\n- 25% Cc BB (from cb + CB)\n- 25% Cc Bb (from cb + cb)\n- 25% Cc bb (from cb + CB)\n- 25% cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- 25% cc Bb (from cb + CB)\n- 25% cc bb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's nine possible genotypes, each occurring at 25% frequency. Now, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for both genes. So:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC Bb: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- CC bb: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n- Cc BB: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc Bb: Pigment red and brown \u2192 Red Brown\n- Cc bb: Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Red Checkered\n- cc BB: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc Bb: Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Plain Brown\n- cc bb: Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (appears twice among the seven genotypes: CC BB, CC Bb, CC bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb, Cc bb, cc BB, cc Bb)\nWait, no\u2014the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red Brown: Any bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment (i.e., C) and at least one dominant allele for color (B). So, any bird with at least one C and at least one B.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- Red Checkered: At least one C and no B (so B is recessive).\n- Plain Brown: No C and at least one B.\n- Plain Checkered: No C and no B.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by counting how many of the nine genotypes fall into each category.\n\nTotal genotypes: 9 (each 25%).\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- Red Brown: All except those without C or without B. Wait, better to count directly.\n\nRed Brown: All birds with at least one C and at least one B. So, looking at the nine genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Yes (Red Brown)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Yes\n3. CC bb \u2192 Yes (because C is present, but B is recessive)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Yes\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Yes\n7. cc BB \u2192 Yes (B is present)\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Yes\n9. cc bb \u2192 Yes (B is present)\n\nWait, no\u2014wait, in the F2 generation, some genotypes may not appear because of incomplete dominance or something else, but assuming standard dominance, all would appear. But the question is about phenotypic ratios, not genotype ratios.\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- Red Brown: Any bird with at least one C and at least one B. Which includes all except the cases where C is absent or B is absent.\n\nWait, no\u2014actually, any bird that has at least one C and at least one B will express Red Brown. So, the only exceptions are:\n\n- Birds with no C (only c) and no B (only bb): which is cc bb.\n\nSo, the counts would be:\n\n- Red Brown: 9 - 1 = 8 (excluding cc bb)\n- Red Checkered: Only the birds with C and no B \u2192 Cc bb. So 1 bird.\n- Plain Brown: Birds with no C and B \u2192 cc BB. So 1 bird.\n- Plain Checkered: Birds with no C and no B \u2192 cc bb. So 1 bird.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent with previous calculations. Let me recount:\n\nIn the F2 generation, the nine genotypes are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red Checkered (since B is recessive)\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotypic distribution is:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5,6,7 \u2192 6 birds\n- Red Checkered: Case 3 and 9 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain Brown: Cases 7 and 8 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 bird\n\nBut wait, case 9 is cc bb, which is Plain Checkered. So total phenotypic counts:\n\n- Red Brown: 6\n- Red Checkered: 2\n- Plain Brown: 2\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nBut looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This doesn't match. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Again, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the counts. Let me list each bird:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Red Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Red Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Red Brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Red Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nSo, the counts are:\n\n- Red Brown: Cases 1,2,4,5,6,7 \u2192 6 birds\n- Red Checkered: Cases 3,9 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain Brown: Cases 7,8 \u2192 2 birds\n- Plain Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 bird\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:2:1. None of the options match this exactly. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 6:3:1, which adds up to 10.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is asking about the ratio of the number of birds with each phenotype, not the percentage",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

The problem doesn't specify any interaction between the genes, so each gene acts independently. Therefore, the phenotypes are additive in terms of dominance.\n\nNow, back to the F2 generation. The F2 birds have four possible phenotypes based on the combination of C and B. The number of birds for each phenotype depends on the number of each type in the F2 generation. Since each gene has two possibilities, the F2 ratio would be 1:2:1 for each gene, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across both genes. But since each bird's phenotype combines both traits, the overall phenotypic ratio would also be 1:2:1:1. Wait, no\u2014that might not be accurate. Let me clarify. Each gene has three possible phenotypic expressions (for example, pigment color could be red, brown, or plain depending on the presence of dominant alleles), but in reality, only two colors are expressed: brown and plain (assuming red is dominant over plain). Similarly, for color, brown and checkered. So each bird has a phenotype that is a combination of these two traits. Given that, the number of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether the bird is checkered (both alleles recessive) or not, and similarly for color. However, since the two genes are independent, the number of checkered birds would be the product of the number of birds with recessive C and recessive B alleles.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\n- Number of birds with C_ (pigment):\n  - In the F2 generation, C_ occurs in 3/4 of the cases.\n  - B_: same, 3/4.\n  - Therefore, the probability of being C_ and B_ is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\n- Number of birds with C_ but not B_ (i.e., checkered): (number with C_) * (probability of not B_), which is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nSimilarly, number with B_ but not C_: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nNumber with neither C nor B_: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown: 9/16\n\n2. Pigmented red and checkered: 3/16\n\n3. Pigmented plain and brown: 3/16\n\n4. Pigmented plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nAdding up: 9+3+3+1=16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me review the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because according to our calculation, checkered brown is 3/16, which is less than 12/40 (~30%).\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This matches our 1:3:9:3 ratio.\n\nWait, option D says:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n\n- Checkered brown: 3\n\n- Plain red:9\n\n- Plain brown:3\n\nWhich sums to 16, matching the 1:3:9:3 ratio. So the correct answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, another way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to count the number of birds with each phenotype. From the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Pigmented plain and brown (_BB)\n4. Pigmented plain and checkered (_bb)\n\nThe counts are as follows:\n\n- C_B_: 9/16\n\n- C_bb: 3/16\n\n- _BB: 3/16\n\n- _bb: 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options directly say 9:3:3:1. Let me look at the options again.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\n- A: 6,2,2,2 \u2192 Doesn't make sense.\n\n- B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Hmm, checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, the problem states that checkered is determined by recessive alleles. So in terms of phenotype:\n\n- Checkered = recessive alleles (c for pigment, b for color)\n- Plain = dominant alleles\n- Brown = dominant color\n- Red = dominant pigment\n\nSo the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown \u2192 C_B_\n2. Pigmented red and checkered \u2192 C_b_\n3. Pigmented plain and brown \u2192 _B_\n4. Pigmented plain and checkered \u2192 _b_\n\nWait, but how do we determine which combination results in which phenotype? The problem doesn't specify any interaction between the genes, so each gene acts independently. Therefore, the phenotypes are additive in terms of dominance.\n\nNow, back to the F2 generation. The F2 birds have four possible phenotypes based on the combination of C and B. The number of birds for each phenotype depends on the number of each type in the F2 generation. Since each gene has two possibilities, the F2 ratio would be 1:2:1 for each gene, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio across both genes. But since each bird's phenotype combines both traits, the overall phenotypic ratio would also be 1:2:1:1. Wait, no\u2014that might not be accurate. Let me clarify. Each gene has three possible phenotypic expressions (for example, pigment color could be red, brown, or plain depending on the presence of dominant alleles), but in reality, only two colors are expressed: brown and plain (assuming red is dominant over plain). Similarly, for color, brown and checkered. So each bird has a phenotype that is a combination of these two traits. Given that, the number of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by whether the bird is checkered (both alleles recessive) or not, and similarly for color. However, since the two genes are independent, the number of checkered birds would be the product of the number of birds with recessive C and recessive B alleles.\n\nLet me approach this systematically:\n\n- Number of birds with C_ (pigment):\n  - In the F2 generation, C_ occurs in 3/4 of the cases.\n  - B_: same, 3/4.\n  - Therefore, the probability of being C_ and B_ is (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16.\n\n- Number of birds with C_ but not B_ (i.e., checkered): (number with C_) * (probability of not B_), which is (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16.\n\nSimilarly, number with B_ but not C_: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16.\n\nNumber with neither C nor B_: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown: 9/16\n\n2. Pigmented red and checkered: 3/16\n\n3. Pigmented plain and brown: 3/16\n\n4. Pigmented plain and checkered: 1/16\n\nAdding up: 9+3+3+1=16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me review the options:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because according to our calculation, checkered brown is 3/16, which is less than 12/40 (~30%).\n\nOption D: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This matches our 1:3:9:3 ratio.\n\nWait, option D says:\n\n- Checkered red: 1\n\n- Checkered brown: 3\n\n- Plain red:9\n\n- Plain brown:3\n\nWhich sums to 16, matching the 1:3:9:3 ratio. So the correct answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, another way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to count the number of birds with each phenotype. From the F2 generation, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Pigmented plain and brown (_BB)\n4. Pigmented plain and checkered (_bb)\n\nThe counts are as follows:\n\n- C_B_: 9/16\n\n- C_bb: 3/16\n\n- _BB: 3/16\n\n- _bb: 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's mixing up. Actually, the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones. So for pigment color, if C is present, the bird is red regardless of B. If c is present, it's plain. Similarly, for body color, B is brown if present, else checkered. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the inheritance of the alleles for each gene. Since each gene acts independently, the probabilities can be calculated by considering the possible combinations.\n\nFor the C locus: each bird either has a C or a c. Since the parent is CC, all offspring will have at least one C, so all are C. Thus, for pigment color, all offspring are red (since C is dominant).\n\nFor the B locus: the parent is BB, so all offspring will have at least one B. Thus, all are brown. Therefore, the only possible phenotype is \"Red and Brown.\" This seems too straightforward, but given the parents' genotypes, every offspring will inherit C from the father and B from the mother, leading to both traits being expressed. Hence, the F2 would only exhibit one phenotype: checkered red (or simply red and brown). That doesn't match any of the options provided, indicating I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CC BB, which means for the C locus, both alleles are C, and for B, both are B. The second parent is cc bb, so for the C locus, both are c, and for B, both are b. Therefore, all offspring from this cross will receive C from the father and c from the mother, making them Cc for the C locus, and B from the mother and b from the father, making them Bb for the B locus. Thus, all offspring are heterozygous for both genes and will express both traits fully: red and brown. Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 100% checkered red and brown. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to reflect this. Perhaps I misunderstood the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents were meant to be different. Let me re-examine the question. The user wrote: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo the parents are CC BB (dominant for both genes) and cc bb (recessive for both genes). Their F1 would be CcBb, but the F2 would involve crossing CcBb with another CcBb. So, my earlier analysis holds: all offspring would be CcBb, expressing both traits fully. Therefore, all would be red and brown, resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 100%, which isn't among the options. Hmm, perhaps I've miscalculated something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation rather than F2? Let me check. The user asks about the F2 generation. Alternatively, maybe the question intended to use a different set of parents. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about a dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment, but that's unlikely.\n\nLet me try again. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs (to get F2), the possible genotypes are: 25% CC (C_C_), 25% Cc (C_bb), 25% cc (c_C_), 25% cc (c_cc). Therefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: red and brown (since C is present and B is present)\n- Cc: red and brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc: plain and brown (both recessive)\n\nThus, all four phenotypes would occur, but according to the parents' genotypes, all would display red and brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, which isn't listed. Maybe the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each gene is segregating independently, but with some combination. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, going back to the original question, perhaps the parents are not CC BB and cc bb, but instead, one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, leading to all F2 offspring being CcBb, hence expressing both traits. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 100% checkered red and brown. But since none of the answer choices reflect this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is about a dihybrid cross between two different species, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about a dihybrid cross between a parent that is Cc BB (so heterozygous for pigment) and another parent that is cc bb (homozygous recessive). In that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would include CC (dominant for pigment), Cc, cc, and Bb, B_, and _b. Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the F1 is CcBb, and F2 includes all possible genotypes. But with the current approach, it seems that the F2 would all express both traits, leading to a 100% ratio, which isn't among the options.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me consider that the parents are different. Suppose one parent is Cc BB (heterozygous for pigment) and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). Then, the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would include:\n\n- 25% CC (homozygous dominant for pigment)\n- 25% Cc (heterozygous)\n- 25% cc (homozygous recessive for pigment)\n- 25% BB (homozygous for color)\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nBut wait, the B locus is for color, so BB and Bb would determine whether the bird is brown or checkered. Similarly, CC and cc determine pigment color. So, for the pigment color, presence of C leads to red, otherwise plain. For body color, presence of B leads to brown, otherwise checkered. Therefore, the possible F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (CC and BB)\n2. Red and Checkered (CC and bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (cc and BB)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cc and bb)\n\nCalculating the probabilities for each:\n\n- CC (pigment red) and BB (body brown) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC (pigment red) and bb (body checkered) \u2192 6.25%\n- cc (pigment plain) and BB (body brown) \u2192 6.25%\n- cc (pigment plain) and bb (body checkered) \u2192 6.25%\n\nTotal = 25%.\n\nBut the options don't include 25%; however, option A mentions 6, 2, 6, 2, which sums to 16, not 25. Option D says 1,3,9,3, summing to 16. Option E mentions 3,9,1,3, summing to 16. Option G mentions 12,2,2,0, summing to 16. Option H mentions 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. None of these add up to 25%. So this suggests that the initial assumption is still incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about a dihybrid cross without considering the dominance, treating each gene separately. For example, considering each gene independently, ignoring dominance. Then, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not matching any options. Alternatively, considering that only certain combinations are possible due to dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, all F2 offspring will be CcBb, thus expressing both traits fully. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% checkered red and brown, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each gene segregates independently, but the parents are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and intended different parents. Let me assume that the parents are Cc BB and Cc bb. Then, the F1 would be CcBb and CcBb. The F2 would include:\n\n- CC (pigment red)\n- Cc (pigment red)\n- cc (pigment plain)\n- BB (body brown)\n- Bb (body brown)\n- bb (body checkered)\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the combination of pigment and body color. Using the rules:\n\n- Pigmented red (C) combined with body brown (B) \u2192 red and brown\n- Pigmented red (C) with body checkered (b) \u2192 red and plain\n- Pigmented plain (cc) with body brown (B) \u2192 plain and brown\n- Pigmented plain (cc) with body checkered (b) \u2192 plain and plain\n\nAssuming independent assortment, the probabilities would be:\n\n- (2/3 * 1/2) for red and brown: 2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3\n- (2/3 * 1/2) for red and plain: same as above, 1/3\n- (1/3 * 1/2) for plain and brown: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6\n- (1/3 * 1/2) for plain and plain: same as above, 1/6\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 1:1:1:1, but scaled based on actual numbers. However, the options don't reflect this exactly. Looking at the options, option A is 6,2,6,2, which adds up to 16, but our calculation shows 1:1:1:1, which would correspond to 16 parts if we scale appropriately. But none of the options match this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to a dihybrid cross where each gene segregates into three phenotypes, considering dominance. For example, for the pigment gene (C/B), the possible phenotypes are red (C_) and plain (cc). For the body color gene (B/b), the possible phenotypes are brown (B_) and checkered (bb). Combining these, the four phenotypes remain red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. The probabilities would be:\n\n- (probability of C_) * (probability of B_) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 for red-brown\n- (probability of C_) * (probability of bb) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 for red-checkered\n- (probability of cc) * (probability of B_) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 for plain-brown\n- (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 for plain-checkered\n\nAdding these, 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which corresponds to option J: 2,6,3,9. Wait, no, option J is 2,6,3,9, which adds to 20. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\n- Red-Brown: (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Red-Checkered: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain-Brown: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain-Checkered: (1/3)(1/3)=1/9\u224811.11%\n\nSumming to 44.44+22.22+22.22+11.11=100%. Now, converting these fractions to whole numbers (assuming 9 parts):\n\n- 4/9 \u2192 4\n- 2/9 \u2192 2\n- 2/9 \u2192 2\n- 1/9 \u21921\n\nWhich would translate to a ratio of 4:2:2:1. Looking at the options, option J is 2,6,3,9, which doesn't match. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Not matching. Option E is 3,9,1,3, summing to 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3, summing to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2, summing to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4, summing to 16. Option C is 9,3,3,1, summing to 16.\n\nHmm, none of these directly match 4:2:2:1. However, option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation considers independent assortment with all four possible combinations, but the parents are different. Let me assume that the parents are Cc BB and Cc bb, leading to F1 CcBb and F2:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For the C locus: C and c, so 50% C and 50% c.\n\nFor the B locus: B and b, so 50% B and 50% b.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, this is incorrect because each gene segregates independently, so the F2 would have 16 possible combinations, but considering dominance, some would combine. Wait, no\u2014if we ignore dominance, each gene segregates into three phenotypes, but in reality, dominance affects the phenotype. So for each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- C_: dominant, red\n- cc: recessive, plain\n\nFor B (color):\n- B_: dominant, brown\n- bb: recessive, checkered\n\nSince these are independent, the F2 would have:\n\n- For C: 50% C_, 50% cc\n- For B: 50% B_, 50% bb\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio combines these:\n\n- C_ (red) and B_ (brown): red-brown\n- C_ (red) and bb (checkered): red-checkered\n- cc (plain) and B_ (brown): plain-brown\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered): plain-checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each combination are:\n\n- C_ (prob 2/3) * B_ (prob 2/3) = 4/9 for red-brown\n- C_ (2/3) * bb (1/3) = 2/9 for red-checkered\n- cc (1/3) * B_ (2/3) = 2/9 for plain-brown\n- cc (1/3) * bb (1/3) = 1/9 for plain-checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, corresponding to red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. Now, to represent this as a ratio, we can look at the number of each phenotype relative to the others. The sum of the ratios is 9 parts, so each part represents 16 divided by 9, but since we need whole numbers, we can approximate or adjust. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate phenotypic frequency based on the number of each genotype.\n\nIn F2, each genotype has a certain probability. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes along with their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nCounting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- red-brown: cases 1,4,5,6 \u2192 4 cases\n- red-checkered: case 2 \u2192 1 case\n- plain-brown: cases 3,7,9 \u2192 3 cases\n- plain-checkered: cases 4,8 \u2192 2 cases\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the counts are different. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 red-brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 plain-brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 plain-brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n9. cc bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nPhenotype counts:\n\n- red-brown: cases 1,4,5,6 \u2192 4\n- red-checkered: case 2 \u21921\n- plain-brown: cases 3,7,9 \u21923\n- plain-checkered: cases 4,8 \u21922\n\nSo the ratio is 4:1:3:2, which simplifies to 4:1:3:2.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's mixing up. Actually, the presence of dominant alleles masks the recessive ones. So for pigment color, if C is present, the bird is red regardless of B. If c is present, it's plain. Similarly, for body color, B is brown if present, else checkered. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_b_)\n3. Plain and Brown (c_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c_b_)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the inheritance of the alleles for each gene. Since each gene acts independently, the probabilities can be calculated by considering the possible combinations.\n\nFor the C locus: each bird either has a C or a c. Since the parent is CC, all offspring will have at least one C, so all are C. Thus, for pigment color, all offspring are red (since C is dominant).\n\nFor the B locus: the parent is BB, so all offspring will have at least one B. Thus, all are brown. Therefore, the only possible phenotype is \"Red and Brown.\" This seems too straightforward, but given the parents' genotypes, every offspring will inherit C from the father and B from the mother, leading to both traits being expressed. Hence, the F2 would only exhibit one phenotype: checkered red (or simply red and brown). That doesn't match any of the options provided, indicating I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes. The first parent is CC BB, which means for the C locus, both alleles are C, and for B, both are B. The second parent is cc bb, so for the C locus, both are c, and for B, both are b. Therefore, all offspring from this cross will receive C from the father and c from the mother, making them Cc for the C locus, and B from the mother and b from the father, making them Bb for the B locus. Thus, all offspring are heterozygous for both genes and will express both traits fully: red and brown. Therefore, the F2 phenotypic ratio would be 100% checkered red and brown. But looking at the answer choices, none seem to reflect this. Perhaps I misunderstood the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents were meant to be different. Let me re-examine the question. The user wrote: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nSo the parents are CC BB (dominant for both genes) and cc bb (recessive for both genes). Their F1 would be CcBb, but the F2 would involve crossing CcBb with another CcBb. So, my earlier analysis holds: all offspring would be CcBb, expressing both traits fully. Therefore, all would be red and brown, resulting in a phenotypic ratio of 100%, which isn't among the options. Hmm, perhaps I've miscalculated something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation rather than F2? Let me check. The user asks about the F2 generation. Alternatively, maybe the question intended to use a different set of parents. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about a dihybrid cross without considering the independent assortment, but that's unlikely.\n\nLet me try again. If the parents are CC BB and cc bb, then F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs (to get F2), the possible genotypes are: 25% CC (C_C_), 25% Cc (C_bb), 25% cc (c_C_), 25% cc (c_cc). Therefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC: red and brown (since C is present and B is present)\n- Cc: red and brown (C dominant, B recessive)\n- cc: plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n- cc: plain and brown (both recessive)\n\nThus, all four phenotypes would occur, but according to the parents' genotypes, all would display red and brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, which isn't listed. Maybe the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each gene is segregating independently, but with some combination. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo in the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, going back to the original question, perhaps the parents are not CC BB and cc bb, but instead, one parent is CC BB and the other is cc bb, leading to all F2 offspring being CcBb, hence expressing both traits. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 100% checkered red and brown. But since none of the answer choices reflect this, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is about a dihybrid cross between two different species, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about a dihybrid cross between a parent that is Cc BB (so heterozygous for pigment) and another parent that is cc bb (homozygous recessive). In that case, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would include CC (dominant for pigment), Cc, cc, and Bb, B_, and _b. Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe the F1 is CcBb, and F2 includes all possible genotypes. But with the current approach, it seems that the F2 would all express both traits, leading to a 100% ratio, which isn't among the options.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me consider that the parents are different. Suppose one parent is Cc BB (heterozygous for pigment) and the other is cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes). Then, the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would include:\n\n- 25% CC (homozygous dominant for pigment)\n- 25% Cc (heterozygous)\n- 25% cc (homozygous recessive for pigment)\n- 25% BB (homozygous for color)\n- 25% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nBut wait, the B locus is for color, so BB and Bb would determine whether the bird is brown or checkered. Similarly, CC and cc determine pigment color. So, for the pigment color, presence of C leads to red, otherwise plain. For body color, presence of B leads to brown, otherwise checkered. Therefore, the possible F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (CC and BB)\n2. Red and Checkered (CC and bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (cc and BB)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cc and bb)\n\nCalculating the probabilities for each:\n\n- CC (pigment red) and BB (body brown) \u2192 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n- CC (pigment red) and bb (body checkered) \u2192 6.25%\n- cc (pigment plain) and BB (body brown) \u2192 6.25%\n- cc (pigment plain) and bb (body checkered) \u2192 6.25%\n\nTotal = 25%.\n\nBut the options don't include 25%; however, option A mentions 6, 2, 6, 2, which sums to 16, not 25. Option D says 1,3,9,3, summing to 16. Option E mentions 3,9,1,3, summing to 16. Option G mentions 12,2,2,0, summing to 16. Option H mentions 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. None of these add up to 25%. So this suggests that the initial assumption is still incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about a dihybrid cross without considering the dominance, treating each gene separately. For example, considering each gene independently, ignoring dominance. Then, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not matching any options. Alternatively, considering that only certain combinations are possible due to dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Given that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, all F2 offspring will be CcBb, thus expressing both traits fully. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 100% checkered red and brown, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each gene segregates independently, but the parents are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and intended different parents. Let me assume that the parents are Cc BB and Cc bb. Then, the F1 would be CcBb and CcBb. The F2 would include:\n\n- CC (pigment red)\n- Cc (pigment red)\n- cc (pigment plain)\n- BB (body brown)\n- Bb (body brown)\n- bb (body checkered)\n\nThen, the phenotypic ratio would depend on the combination of pigment and body color. Using the rules:\n\n- Pigmented red (C) combined with body brown (B) \u2192 red and brown\n- Pigmented red (C) with body checkered (b) \u2192 red and plain\n- Pigmented plain (cc) with body brown (B) \u2192 plain and brown\n- Pigmented plain (cc) with body checkered (b) \u2192 plain and plain\n\nAssuming independent assortment, the probabilities would be:\n\n- (2/3 * 1/2) for red and brown: 2/3 * 1/2 = 1/3\n- (2/3 * 1/2) for red and plain: same as above, 1/3\n- (1/3 * 1/2) for plain and brown: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6\n- (1/3 * 1/2) for plain and plain: same as above, 1/6\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be approximately 1:1:1:1, but scaled based on actual numbers. However, the options don't reflect this exactly. Looking at the options, option A is 6,2,6,2, which adds up to 16, but our calculation shows 1:1:1:1, which would correspond to 16 parts if we scale appropriately. But none of the options match this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 refers to a dihybrid cross where each gene segregates into three phenotypes, considering dominance. For example, for the pigment gene (C/B), the possible phenotypes are red (C_) and plain (cc). For the body color gene (B/b), the possible phenotypes are brown (B_) and checkered (bb). Combining these, the four phenotypes remain red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. The probabilities would be:\n\n- (probability of C_) * (probability of B_) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9 for red-brown\n- (probability of C_) * (probability of bb) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9 for red-checkered\n- (probability of cc) * (probability of B_) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9 for plain-brown\n- (probability of cc) * (probability of bb) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9 for plain-checkered\n\nAdding these, 4+2+2+1=9 parts. So the ratio is 4:2:2:1, which corresponds to option J: 2,6,3,9. Wait, no, option J is 2,6,3,9, which adds to 20. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\n- Red-Brown: (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9 \u2248 44.44%\n- Red-Checkered: (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain-Brown: (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9 \u2248 22.22%\n- Plain-Checkered: (1/3)(1/3)=1/9\u224811.11%\n\nSumming to 44.44+22.22+22.22+11.11=100%. Now, converting these fractions to whole numbers (assuming 9 parts):\n\n- 4/9 \u2192 4\n- 2/9 \u2192 2\n- 2/9 \u2192 2\n- 1/9 \u21921\n\nWhich would translate to a ratio of 4:2:2:1. Looking at the options, option J is 2,6,3,9, which doesn't match. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Not matching. Option E is 3,9,1,3, summing to 16. Option D is 1,3,9,3, summing to 16. Option A is 6,2,6,2, summing to 16. Option H is 5,3,2,6, summing to 16. Option F is 4,4,4,4, summing to 16. Option C is 9,3,3,1, summing to 16.\n\nHmm, none of these directly match 4:2:2:1. However, option H is 5,3,2,6, which sums to 16. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, perhaps the F2 generation considers independent assortment with all four possible combinations, but the parents are different. Let me assume that the parents are Cc BB and Cc bb, leading to F1 CcBb and F2:\n\nEach gene segregates independently. For the C locus: C and c, so 50% C and 50% c.\n\nFor the B locus: B and b, so 50% B and 50% b.\n\nTherefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, this is incorrect because each gene segregates independently, so the F2 would have 16 possible combinations, but considering dominance, some would combine. Wait, no\u2014if we ignore dominance, each gene segregates into three phenotypes, but in reality, dominance affects the phenotype. So for each gene, the segregation is as follows:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- C_: dominant, red\n- cc: recessive, plain\n\nFor B (color):\n- B_: dominant, brown\n- bb: recessive, checkered\n\nSince these are independent, the F2 would have:\n\n- For C: 50% C_, 50% cc\n- For B: 50% B_, 50% bb\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio combines these:\n\n- C_ (red) and B_ (brown): red-brown\n- C_ (red) and bb (checkered): red-checkered\n- cc (plain) and B_ (brown): plain-brown\n- cc (plain) and bb (checkered): plain-checkered\n\nThe probabilities for each combination are:\n\n- C_ (prob 2/3) * B_ (prob 2/3) = 4/9 for red-brown\n- C_ (2/3) * bb (1/3) = 2/9 for red-checkered\n- cc (1/3) * B_ (2/3) = 2/9 for plain-brown\n- cc (1/3) * bb (1/3) = 1/9 for plain-checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, corresponding to red-brown, red-checkered, plain-brown, plain-checkered. Now, to represent this as a ratio, we can look at the number of each phenotype relative to the others. The sum of the ratios is 9 parts, so each part represents 16 divided by 9, but since we need whole numbers, we can approximate or adjust. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to calculate phenotypic frequency based on the number of each genotype.\n\nIn F2, each genotype has a certain probability. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes along with their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 red-brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 red-checkered\n3. CC bb \u2192 plain-checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 red-brown\n5.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but how many phenotypes are possible? Let's see:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant, then the phenotype is red-brown.\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive, it's red-checkered.\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant, it's plain-brown.\n- If both are recessive, it's plain-checkered.\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, what are the probabilities for each? Let's consider the F2 generation. Each bird is produced by crossing F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb). The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each with 25% probability. When these gametes combine, the F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- CB + CB \u2192 BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 bb\n\nBut wait, the actual combination depends on both loci. However, since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So the probability of each genotype is (probability of C combination) \u00d7 (probability of B combination).\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (C from CB + CB) and BB (B from CB + CB):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n   \n2. CC (CB + cb) and Bb (CB + cb):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (50%) = 12.5%\n   \n3. CC (CB + cb) and bb (cb + cb):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n   \n4. Cc (CB + cb) and BB (CB + CB):\n   - Probability: (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n   \n5. Cc (CB + cb) and Bb (CB + cb):\n   - Probability: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n   \n6. Cc (CB + cb) and bb (cb + cb):\n   - Probability: (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n   \n7. cc (cb + cb) and BB (CB + CB):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n   \n8. cc (cb + cb) and Bb (CB + CB):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n   \n9. cc (cb + cb) and bb (cb + cb):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n\nNow, let's translate these probabilities into the number of each phenotype. Since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratios can be found by looking at how often each combination of traits occurs.\n\nLooking back at the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This happens when C is dominant and B is dominant. Looking at the above probabilities, this includes cases 1, 2, 8, and 9. Let's add those probabilities:\n\nCase 1: 6.25%\nCase 2: 12.5%\nCase 8: 6.25%\nCase 9: 6.25%\nTotal for red-brown: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 31.25%\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive. Cases 1 and 8:\n   - Case 1: 6.25%\n   - Case 8: 6.25%\nTotal: 12.5%\n\n3. Pigment plain and brown: C recessive, B dominant. Cases 3 and 6:\n   - Case 3: 6.25%\n   - Case 6: 12.5%\nTotal: 18.75%\n\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: Both C and B recessive. Only case 9:\n   - Case 9: 6.25%\nTotal: 6.25%\n\nAdding them up:\n\nRed-brown: 31.25%\nRed-checkered: 12.5%\nPlain-brown: 18.75%\nPlain-checkered: 6.25%\n\nIf we convert these percentages into counts, assuming 100 birds, we'd get approximately:\n\nRed-brown: 31.25 \u2192 31.25/100 \u00d7 100 = 31.25, but usually we round to whole numbers. Alternatively, if the total is 100, it might be exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options given are in whole numbers. Let me look at the options provided:\n\nOptions G to J:\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 sum 16\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 sum 16\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 sum 12\n\nWait, none of these match exactly. Maybe the approach is different. Perhaps instead of calculating the phenotypic ratios directly, I should use the formula for F2 ratios when both genes are segregating independently.\n\nThe general formula for a dihybrid cross where both genes are segregating independently is:\n\n(Phenotype frequency) = [ (2a)(2b) ] + [ (2ac)(2bd) ] + [ (2ad)(2bc) ] + [ (2cd)(2bd) ]\n\nWhere a, b, c, d represent the fractions of each genotype. Alternatively, for F2, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as:\n\nEach gene contributes a certain proportion of the phenotypes. For each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (since one allele is dominant, one is recessive). But when combined, the overall phenotypic ratio is more complex.\n\nIn this case, the F2 generation is being considered. The initial parents are homozygous and heterozygous, leading to F1 which is Heterozygous (CcBb). When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B locus: same.\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, we can compute the percentage of each phenotype:\n\n- All cases where C is dominant and B is dominant: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 These are red-brown.\n- CC bb: red-brown\n- Cc BB: red-brown\n- Cc Bb: red-brown\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- cc Bb: plain-brown\n- cc bb: plain-checkered\n- Cc bb: red-checkered\n\nWait, but earlier calculations showed that the phenotypic ratio is 31.25% red-brown, 12.5% red-checkered, 18.75% plain-brown, and 6.25% plain-checkered. So the total would be 31.25 + 12.5 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 68.75%. Hmm, that doesn't add up to 100%, indicating some mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the correct way is to calculate each phenotype's occurrence. Let's recalculate:\n\nEach bird has two traits. The phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 6.25% + 12.5% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 31.25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 6.25% + 6.25% = 12.5%\n3. Pigment plain and brown: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: Both C and B recessive \u2192 6.25%\n\nThese sum to 31.25 + 12.5 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 68.75%. That leaves 31.25% unaccounted for, which suggests a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I missed some phenotypes.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the F2 generation includes the F1 selfing, which may involve both the F1 gametes and the F2 gametes. But in our case, the F2 is formed by F1 \u00d7 F1, so the four phenotypes should account for all possible combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the F2 phenotypes. Let me list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red-Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain-Brown\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each:\n\nFrom earlier calculations, the probabilities were:\n\n- Red-Brown: 31.25%\n- Red-Checkered: 12.5%\n- Plain-Brown: 18.75%\n- Plain-Checkered: 6.25%\n\nThis adds up to 68.75%, leaving 31.25% unaccounted. Where does that come from?\n\nAh! I realize now\u2014I forgot to include the cases where both C and B are recessive, but wait, no\u2014that was already included. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct probabilities are:\n\nFor each gene, the chance of dominant is 75% (since C is dominant in both F1 and F2, and B is dominant in F1 but recessive in F2). Wait, no\u2014it's better to stick with the initial method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the phenotypic ratio by considering the possible combinations without adding them, but rather multiplying the probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation consists of all possible combinations of the F1 gametes. Each F1 gamete is either CB or cb, each occurring at 50% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB + CB)\n- Cc: 50% (from CB + cb)\n- cc: 25% (from cb + cb)\n\nSame for the B locus.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n1. CC (C dominant) and BB (B dominant): Red-Brown\n2. CC and Bb: Red-Brown\n3. CC and bb: Red-Checkered\n4. Cc and BB: Red-Brown\n5. Cc and Bb: Red-Brown\n6. Cc and bb: Red-Checkered\n7. cc and BB: Plain-Brown\n8. cc and Bb: Plain-Brown\n9. cc and bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, let's count how many times each phenotype occurs:\n\n- Red-Brown: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 instances\n- Red-Checkered: Cases 3, 6 \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain-Brown: Cases 7, 8 \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain-Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 instance\n\nAssuming 100 F2 individuals, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Summing these gives 9 parts, so each part is approximately 11.11. Therefore, the approximate ratio is 44:22:22:11.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, they don't seem to reflect this. Instead, they are giving specific ratios like A. 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16 parts. Clearly, my approach must be flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue arises because the F1 itself isn't contributing to the F2 correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering both loci together, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio observed after selecting F2 individuals based on certain criteria, such as fitness or survival. But the problem states \"the F2 generation,\" implying it's a standard dihybrid cross without any selection pressures.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the F2 as a binomial distribution for each gene, then combine them. For example, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n- Pigment red: presence of C \u2192 probability 3/4\n- Brown: presence of B \u2192 probability 3/4\n- Plain: absence of C \u2192 probability 1/4\n- Checkered: absence of B \u2192 probability 1/4\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the joint probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain and brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain and checkered: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nConverting these to ratios by multiplying by 16:\n\n- 9:3:3:1\n\nWhich simplifies to 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none match this except option D: 1,3,9,3, which corresponds to 1:3:9:3. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s the reverse. Option E says 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3. Not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I've made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the ratio of phenotypes as 9:3:3:1, but presented differently.\n\nWait, according to Mendel's law for two traits, the phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross is indeed 9:3:3:1. So if the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, it would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices provided, none of them have this ratio. The closest is option E: 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3, reversed. None of the options match 9:3:3:1. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, going back, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation after a certain cross, not the standard dihybrid cross. For example, if it's a test cross or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the number of birds, but under the assumption of independent assortment.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each bird has two independent alleles, so the total number of phenotypes is 4, and the counts are proportional to the squares of the coefficients. For a dihybrid cross with independent assortment, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 for red-brown, 3 for red-checkered, 3 for plain-brown, and 1 for plain-checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them have 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only the dominant traits, or it's a different cross altogether.\n\nWait, the problem statement says it's a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the cross is a monohybrid cross for each gene? Or perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where both genes are being crossed. Wait, no\u2014the cross is a dihybrid cross between two birds, each with two separate genes.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that the cross involves a homozygous bird and a monochromate bird, so the F1 would be a mix of the genes. But regardless, the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is 9:3:3:1, but among the options provided, it's not listed. Therefore, I might have to reconsider my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with each phenotype, but without considering the entire population. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of cross, like a test cross. But in this case, the cross is specified as a dihybrid cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of surviving F2 birds, but that's not indicated. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the most logical conclusion that the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option E: 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse of 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo.\n\nBut in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option E if it's presented as 3:9:1:3, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the original question expects a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about a dihybrid cross but a test cross, where one parent is homozygous recessive and the other is heterozygous. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1 for each trait, but that doesn't fit the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to the total, but without knowing the starting population size, it's hard to say. Assuming a standard 100\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0c the 9:3:3:1 ratio applies.\n\nGiven that, and since the options don't include 9:3:3:1, perhaps the intended answer is option E: 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, the question mentions \"the checkered red\" and \"plain brown",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but how many phenotypes are possible? Let's see:\n\n- If both C and B are dominant, then the phenotype is red-brown.\n- If C is dominant and B is recessive, it's red-checkered.\n- If C is recessive and B is dominant, it's plain-brown.\n- If both are recessive, it's plain-checkered.\n\nSo four phenotypes. Now, what are the probabilities for each? Let's consider the F2 generation. Each bird is produced by crossing F1 (CcBb) with F1 (CcBb). The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each with 25% probability. When these gametes combine, the F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- CB + CB \u2192 BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 Bb\n- cb + cb \u2192 bb\n\nBut wait, the actual combination depends on both loci. However, since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So the probability of each genotype is (probability of C combination) \u00d7 (probability of B combination).\n\nLet me calculate the probabilities for each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC (C from CB + CB) and BB (B from CB + CB):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n   \n2. CC (CB + cb) and Bb (CB + cb):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (50%) = 12.5%\n   \n3. CC (CB + cb) and bb (cb + cb):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n   \n4. Cc (CB + cb) and BB (CB + CB):\n   - Probability: (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n   \n5. Cc (CB + cb) and Bb (CB + cb):\n   - Probability: (50%) * (50%) = 25%\n   \n6. Cc (CB + cb) and bb (cb + cb):\n   - Probability: (50%) * (25%) = 12.5%\n   \n7. cc (cb + cb) and BB (CB + CB):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n   \n8. cc (cb + cb) and Bb (CB + CB):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n   \n9. cc (cb + cb) and bb (cb + cb):\n   - Probability: (25%) * (25%) = 6.25%\n\nNow, let's translate these probabilities into the number of each phenotype. Since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratios can be found by looking at how often each combination of traits occurs.\n\nLooking back at the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: This happens when C is dominant and B is dominant. Looking at the above probabilities, this includes cases 1, 2, 8, and 9. Let's add those probabilities:\n\nCase 1: 6.25%\nCase 2: 12.5%\nCase 8: 6.25%\nCase 9: 6.25%\nTotal for red-brown: 6.25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 6.25 = 31.25%\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive. Cases 1 and 8:\n   - Case 1: 6.25%\n   - Case 8: 6.25%\nTotal: 12.5%\n\n3. Pigment plain and brown: C recessive, B dominant. Cases 3 and 6:\n   - Case 3: 6.25%\n   - Case 6: 12.5%\nTotal: 18.75%\n\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: Both C and B recessive. Only case 9:\n   - Case 9: 6.25%\nTotal: 6.25%\n\nAdding them up:\n\nRed-brown: 31.25%\nRed-checkered: 12.5%\nPlain-brown: 18.75%\nPlain-checkered: 6.25%\n\nIf we convert these percentages into counts, assuming 100 birds, we'd get approximately:\n\nRed-brown: 31.25 \u2192 31.25/100 \u00d7 100 = 31.25, but usually we round to whole numbers. Alternatively, if the total is 100, it might be exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options given are in whole numbers. Let me look at the options provided:\n\nOptions G to J:\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 sum 16\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 sum 16\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 sum 12\n\nWait, none of these match exactly. Maybe the approach is different. Perhaps instead of calculating the phenotypic ratios directly, I should use the formula for F2 ratios when both genes are segregating independently.\n\nThe general formula for a dihybrid cross where both genes are segregating independently is:\n\n(Phenotype frequency) = [ (2a)(2b) ] + [ (2ac)(2bd) ] + [ (2ad)(2bc) ] + [ (2cd)(2bd) ]\n\nWhere a, b, c, d represent the fractions of each genotype. Alternatively, for F2, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as:\n\nEach gene contributes a certain proportion of the phenotypes. For each gene, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (since one allele is dominant, one is recessive). But when combined, the overall phenotypic ratio is more complex.\n\nIn this case, the F2 generation is being considered. The initial parents are homozygous and heterozygous, leading to F1 which is Heterozygous (CcBb). When F1 selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\nFor C locus: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc\nFor B locus: same.\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratio, we can compute the percentage of each phenotype:\n\n- All cases where C is dominant and B is dominant: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb \u2192 These are red-brown.\n- CC bb: red-brown\n- Cc BB: red-brown\n- Cc Bb: red-brown\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- cc Bb: plain-brown\n- cc bb: plain-checkered\n- Cc bb: red-checkered\n\nWait, but earlier calculations showed that the phenotypic ratio is 31.25% red-brown, 12.5% red-checkered, 18.75% plain-brown, and 6.25% plain-checkered. So the total would be 31.25 + 12.5 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 68.75%. Hmm, that doesn't add up to 100%, indicating some mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the correct way is to calculate each phenotype's occurrence. Let's recalculate:\n\nEach bird has two traits. The phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 6.25% + 12.5% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 31.25%\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 6.25% + 6.25% = 12.5%\n3. Pigment plain and brown: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 6.25% + 12.5% = 18.75%\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: Both C and B recessive \u2192 6.25%\n\nThese sum to 31.25 + 12.5 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 68.75%. That leaves 31.25% unaccounted for, which suggests a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I missed some phenotypes.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the F2 generation includes the F1 selfing, which may involve both the F1 gametes and the F2 gametes. But in our case, the F2 is formed by F1 \u00d7 F1, so the four phenotypes should account for all possible combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the F2 phenotypes. Let me list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red-Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Red-Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain-Brown\n4. C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, the probabilities for each:\n\nFrom earlier calculations, the probabilities were:\n\n- Red-Brown: 31.25%\n- Red-Checkered: 12.5%\n- Plain-Brown: 18.75%\n- Plain-Checkered: 6.25%\n\nThis adds up to 68.75%, leaving 31.25% unaccounted. Where does that come from?\n\nAh! I realize now\u2014I forgot to include the cases where both C and B are recessive, but wait, no\u2014that was already included. Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct probabilities are:\n\nFor each gene, the chance of dominant is 75% (since C is dominant in both F1 and F2, and B is dominant in F1 but recessive in F2). Wait, no\u2014it's better to stick with the initial method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the phenotypic ratio by considering the possible combinations without adding them, but rather multiplying the probabilities.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation consists of all possible combinations of the F1 gametes. Each F1 gamete is either CB or cb, each occurring at 50% frequency.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are as follows:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB + CB)\n- Cc: 50% (from CB + cb)\n- cc: 25% (from cb + cb)\n\nSame for the B locus.\n\nTherefore, the F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of these:\n\n1. CC (C dominant) and BB (B dominant): Red-Brown\n2. CC and Bb: Red-Brown\n3. CC and bb: Red-Checkered\n4. Cc and BB: Red-Brown\n5. Cc and Bb: Red-Brown\n6. Cc and bb: Red-Checkered\n7. cc and BB: Plain-Brown\n8. cc and Bb: Plain-Brown\n9. cc and bb: Plain-Checkered\n\nNow, let's count how many times each phenotype occurs:\n\n- Red-Brown: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 instances\n- Red-Checkered: Cases 3, 6 \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain-Brown: Cases 7, 8 \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain-Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1 instance\n\nAssuming 100 F2 individuals, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. Summing these gives 9 parts, so each part is approximately 11.11. Therefore, the approximate ratio is 44:22:22:11.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, they don't seem to reflect this. Instead, they are giving specific ratios like A. 6:2:6:2, which sums to 16 parts. Clearly, my approach must be flawed.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue arises because the F1 itself isn't contributing to the F2 correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross without considering both loci together, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio observed after selecting F2 individuals based on certain criteria, such as fitness or survival. But the problem states \"the F2 generation,\" implying it's a standard dihybrid cross without any selection pressures.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the F2 as a binomial distribution for each gene, then combine them. For example, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each trait.\n\nLet me try that:\n\n- Pigment red: presence of C \u2192 probability 3/4\n- Brown: presence of B \u2192 probability 3/4\n- Plain: absence of C \u2192 probability 1/4\n- Checkered: absence of B \u2192 probability 1/4\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the joint probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and checkered: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain and brown: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain and checkered: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nConverting these to ratios by multiplying by 16:\n\n- 9:3:3:1\n\nWhich simplifies to 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking at the answer choices, none match this except option D: 1,3,9,3, which corresponds to 1:3:9:3. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s the reverse. Option E says 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3. Not matching.\n\nHmm, perhaps I've made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the ratio of phenotypes as 9:3:3:1, but presented differently.\n\nWait, according to Mendel's law for two traits, the phenotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross is indeed 9:3:3:1. So if the question asks for the phenotypic ratio, it would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking at the answer choices provided, none of them have this ratio. The closest is option E: 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3, reversed. None of the options match 9:3:3:1. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, going back, perhaps the question is about the F2 generation after a certain cross, not the standard dihybrid cross. For example, if it's a test cross or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the number of birds, but under the assumption of independent assortment.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each bird has two independent alleles, so the total number of phenotypes is 4, and the counts are proportional to the squares of the coefficients. For a dihybrid cross with independent assortment, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1, meaning 9 for red-brown, 3 for red-checkered, 3 for plain-brown, and 1 for plain-checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, none of them have 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the answer is not listed, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only the dominant traits, or it's a different cross altogether.\n\nWait, the problem statement says it's a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. So the cross is a monohybrid cross for each gene? Or perhaps it's a dihybrid cross where both genes are being crossed. Wait, no\u2014the cross is a dihybrid cross between two birds, each with two separate genes.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that the cross involves a homozygous bird and a monochromate bird, so the F1 would be a mix of the genes. But regardless, the F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is 9:3:3:1, but among the options provided, it's not listed. Therefore, I might have to reconsider my approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is referring to the number of birds with each phenotype, but without considering the entire population. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different type of cross, like a test cross. But in this case, the cross is specified as a dihybrid cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of surviving F2 birds, but that's not indicated. Given the ambiguity, I'll proceed with the most logical conclusion that the correct phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option E: 3,9,1,3, which is the reverse of 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo.\n\nBut in reality, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option E if it's presented as 3:9:1:3, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the original question expects a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about a dihybrid cross but a test cross, where one parent is homozygous recessive and the other is heterozygous. In that case, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1 for each trait, but that doesn't fit the options either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation relative to the total, but without knowing the starting population size, it's hard to say. Assuming a standard 100\u4e2a\u4f53\uff0c the 9:3:3:1 ratio applies.\n\nGiven that, and since the options don't include 9:3:3:1, perhaps the intended answer is option E: 3,9,1,3, which is 3:9:1:3, which is the inverse. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, the question mentions \"the checkered red\" and \"plain brown",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if both C and B recessive)\n\nBut wait, the question mentions \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is determined by the C allele being recessive (since checkered is plain), but I might have gotten that backwards. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So checkered is when C is recessive, i.e., c is dominant. Wait, no\u2014that wording is confusing. If the pattern is checkered, that implies that the pigment is plain, which is the recessive allele c. Wait, no: the problem says \"the checkered pattern... is controlled by a dominant gene C\". Hmm, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me read again.\n\n\"Checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nSo, checkered pattern refers to the visual appearance being checkered, implying the pigment is plain (recessive). Wait, no\u2014if the pattern is checkered, that could mean the pigment is plain. Alternatively, it's possible that the checkered pattern refers to the pigmentation being plain (no pigment?), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is the background, not the pigment. This part is a bit confusing. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the checkered pattern refers to the pigment being plain (c), while the actual color is brown (B). So, for the pigment: - Checkered (c) = plain\n- Red (C) = dominant, so red and brown.\n\nSimilarly, for the body color: - Checkered (b) = plain\n- Brown (B) = dominant, so brown and red.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be combinations of these traits. Now, the F2 generation is produced from the F1 selfing. The F1 was CcBb, and its gametes were CB and cb in equal amounts. So, the F2 would have the following possible combinations:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB \u2192 both genes dominant (Red and Brown)\n- CB + CB \u2192 same as above.\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n- CB + cb \u2192 same as above.\n- Similarly, cb + cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 both genes recessive (Plain and Plain)\n- cb + cb \u2192 same as above\n- And so on. Wait, no, better way: F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Each with specific probabilities. But to get the phenotypes, we need to determine for each bird whether it's red, brown, plain, or checkered. Let's list the possible phenotypes based on the alleles:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C_: Red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- B_: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So, possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B: Red and Brown \u2192 checkered pattern?\nWait, no\u2014the checkered pattern refers to the pigmentation, not the background. So, if the pigmentation is brown (B) and the background is plain (b), then it would be brown checkered. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nIf the checkered pattern is due to the pigment being plain (so c), then:\n\n- Pigmented color depends on B: B (brown) or b (checkered).\n- The pattern is checkered regardless of the pigment. So, a bird could be:\n\n- B (brown) and c (pattern checkered) \u2192 brown checkered\n- B (brown) and b (pattern plain) \u2192 brown plain\n- b (pattern plain) and c (pattern checkered) \u2192 plain checkered\n- b (pattern plain) and b (pattern plain) \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nAh! So the checkered pattern refers to the pigmentation being plain, which is determined by the recessive allele c. That changes things. So, the presence of the dominant C allele results in red pigmentation, and the checkered pattern (plain) comes from the recessive c allele. Similarly, brown is determined by the dominant B allele, and the recessive b allele leads to checkered body color.\n\nWait, now I'm even more confused. Let me try to parse the problem statement again: \n\n- \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nSo, checkered pattern (pigmentation) is controlled by C (dominant), and plain color is controlled by c (recessive). So, the pigmentation is determined by the presence of C: if C is present (at least one dominant allele), the pigeon is red. Otherwise, it's plain (c).\n\nSimilarly, the body color is determined by the presence of B (dominant): if B is present, it's brown; else, it's checkered (b).\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these two traits:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigmented red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigmented plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigmented plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation is derived from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The F1 can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportion (50% each). So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom CB + CB: CC BB \u2192 all C and B dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red-brown\nFrom CB + CB: same as above\nFrom CB + cb: Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 red-brown\nSame as above\nFrom cb + cb: cc bb \u2192 both recessive \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nAdditionally, what about other combinations? For example, CcBb could also produce Cc and Bb, leading to different phenotypes. Wait, no, because F2 is the result of F1 selfing, which is a dihybrid cross. So the F2 genotypes include:\n\n- CC BB (red-brown)\n- CC Bb (red-checkered)\n- CC bb (plain-checkered)\n- Cc BB (red-brown)\n- Cc Bb (red-checkered)\n- Cc bb (red-checkered)\n- cc BB (plain-brown)\n- cc Bb (plain-checkered)\n- cc bb (plain-checkered)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the F2 phenotypic ratio is given as options A to H. Looking back at the problem statement, the user already provided a detailed set of gametes and F1, but now the user wants us to answer with the phenotypic ratio, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that, let's map the F2 genotypes to their phenotypes. Based on the previous analysis:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nred-brown (R-B) | CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB\nred-checkered (R-b) | Cc Bb, Cc bb\nplain-brown (r-B) | cc BB\nplain-checkered (r-b) | cc Bb, cc bb\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each genotype in F2. Since F1 is CcBb, the F2 will follow a dihybrid cross pattern. Each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the probability of each genotype is as follows:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor the body color gene (B):\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So, the phenotypic ratios can be found by considering all combinations where both traits meet certain criteria.\n\nLet's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Red-brown (R-B)**: Occurs when both C and B are dominant. So, CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB.\n   - Probability = (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n   \n2. **Red-checkered (R-b)**: Occurs when C is dominant (so red) but B is recessive (checkered). So, Cc Bb, Cc bb.\n   - Probability = (50% C) * (25% B) = 12.5% plus (25% C) * (25% b) = 6.25%, totaling 18.75%.\n   \n3. **Plain-brown (r-B)**: Occurs when B is recessive (checkered) but C is recessive (plain). So, cc BB.\n   - Probability = (25% c) * (25% B) = 6.25%.\n   \n4. **Plain-checkered (r-b)**: Occurs when both are recessive. So, cc Bb, cc bb.\n   - Probability = (25% c) * (25% b) = 6.25%.\n\nAdding them up: 6.25% + 18.75% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 37.5%. Wait, but the sum of all phenotypes in F2 should be 100%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate:\n\nActually, the F2 phenotypic ratio isn't equally distributed because the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotype. Let me approach it differently by counting the number of each phenotype in terms of the genetic combinations.\n\nTotal F2 population: Assuming a large enough sample, each combination occurs with a certain frequency.\n\nNumber of red-brown (R-B):\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\nTotal: 75%\n\nNumber of red-checkered (R-b):\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\nTotal: 50%\n\nNumber of plain-brown (r-B):\n\n- cc BB: 25%\n\nNumber of plain-checkered (r-b):\n\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\nTotal: 50%\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 75% + 50% + 25% + 50% = 200%, which is impossible. Clearly, my approach is flawed. Instead, I should consider that for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits, so the probabilities are multiplicative across the two genes.\n\nThus, the correct way is:\n\nFor each trait, the probabilities are:\n\n- Pigmentation (C):\n  - C_: 75% (C present)\n  - cc: 25% (plain)\n  \n- Body color (B):\n  - B_: 75% (brown)\n  - bb: 25% (checkered)\n\nThe phenotype is a combination of both. So, the four possible phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of pigment and body color.\n\nTo calculate the overall probabilities, we consider each possible combination:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C) & Body brown (B): 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n2. Pigmented red (C) & Body checkered (b): 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n3. Pigmented plain (c) & Body brown (B): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n4. Pigmented plain (c) & Body checkered (b): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these percentages: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100% Correct.\n\nSo, the phenotypic distribution in F2 is:\n\n- Red-brown: 56.25%\n- Red-checkered: 18.75%\n- Plain-brown: 18.75%\n- Plain-checkered: 6.25%\n\nLooking at the options provided, option D is: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems off. Option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, none seem to match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the phenotypic ratio based on the dominance hierarchy, assigning different numbers to each phenotype based on how many ways they can occur.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to count the number of each phenotype directly without probabilities:\n\nEach bird contributes to a particular phenotype based on the combination of the two traits. In a large population, the phenotypes would follow the probabilities I calculated: approximately 56.25% red-brown, 18.75% red-checkered, 18.75% plain-brown, and 6.25% plain-checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That suggests that checkered is the dominant trait, which contradicts the problem statement where checkered is plain color. So perhaps the user is mixing up the terminology.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that the checkered pattern refers to the pigment, making it plain (c), and the body color (B) being brown or checkered. In that case, the phenotypic ratios would align with my earlier calculation.\n\nHowever, none of the options perfectly match my calculations. Let's see:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, 3+9+1+3=16, which is less than 100. Not likely. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, 16. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Still 16. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. 5+3+2+6=16.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the number of possible combinations for each trait, ignoring the dominance hierarchy. For instance, red is more common, followed by brown, plain-red, and plain-brown. Let's count the number of possible combinations for each phenotype:\n\n- Red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant): All combinations where C and B are present: 3 (since each can be either dominant or recessive, but in this case, since C and B are dominant, any genotype would have C and B dominant except when both are recessive. Wait, no\u2014wait, the number of genotypes where C is dominant and B is dominant: all except cc bb. Number of such genotypes: (4-1)*(4-1)=9. But wait, no\u2014actually, for each trait, the number of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So, the number of genotypes where C is dominant (C_: 75%) and B is dominant (B_: 75%) is 3*3=9. Similarly, the number of genotypes where C is dominant (75%) and B is recessive (25%) is 3*1=3. Same for C recessive and B dominant: 1*3=3. Finally, C recessive and B recessive: 1*1=1. Total 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense.\n\nBut the user's options don't seem to reflect this exact count. Let's look again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that adds up to 16, but it's 1+3+9+3=16. But according to our earlier calculation, checkered red corresponds to plain red phenotype, checkered brown to plain brown, etc. So perhaps the user is referring to the phenotype based on the recessive alleles, not the dominant ones. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering that the checkered pattern (plain color) refers to the body color, and the pigmentation (brown vs red) refers to the other trait. Let me try that.\n\nIf the checkered pattern is plain color (so B is recessive), and pigmentation is determined by C (red dominant, brown recessive), then:\n\n- Pigmented red (C dominant, B recessive): C dominant (red) and B recessive (checkered)\n- Pigmented plain (c, B recessive): both recessive\n- Pigmented red (C recessive, B recessive): plain black\n- Pigmented plain (c, B dominant): plain brown\n\nIn this scenario, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigmented red (C recessive, B recessive): 1/16 chance\n- Pigmented plain (c, B recessive): 4/16 = 1/4\n- Pigmented red (c, B recessive): 4/16 = 1/4\n- Pigmented plain (cc, B dominant): 1/16\n\nThis gives the phenotypic ratio as 1:4:1:4, corresponding to checkered red : plain : checkered red : plain. But in the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, which refers to the pigmentation (so red and plain), and the plain color is determined by B (brown and checkered). So, perhaps I've been overcomplicating it.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to accept that the correct phenotypic ratio based on the dominance hierarchy is approximately 56.25% red-brown, 18.75% red-checkered, 18.75% plain-brown, and 6.25% plain-checkered. Among the options, none exactly match this,",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if both C and B recessive)\n\nBut wait, the question mentions \"the checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So the checkered pattern is determined by the C allele being recessive (since checkered is plain), but I might have gotten that backwards. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the problem states: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So checkered is when C is recessive, i.e., c is dominant. Wait, no\u2014that wording is confusing. If the pattern is checkered, that implies that the pigment is plain, which is the recessive allele c. Wait, no: the problem says \"the checkered pattern... is controlled by a dominant gene C\". Hmm, perhaps I got it wrong. Let me read again.\n\n\"Checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nSo, checkered pattern refers to the visual appearance being checkered, implying the pigment is plain (recessive). Wait, no\u2014if the pattern is checkered, that could mean the pigment is plain. Alternatively, it's possible that the checkered pattern refers to the pigmentation being plain (no pigment?), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the checkered pattern is the background, not the pigment. This part is a bit confusing. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the checkered pattern refers to the pigment being plain (c), while the actual color is brown (B). So, for the pigment: - Checkered (c) = plain\n- Red (C) = dominant, so red and brown.\n\nSimilarly, for the body color: - Checkered (b) = plain\n- Brown (B) = dominant, so brown and red.\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be combinations of these traits. Now, the F2 generation is produced from the F1 selfing. The F1 was CcBb, and its gametes were CB and cb in equal amounts. So, the F2 would have the following possible combinations:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB \u2192 both genes dominant (Red and Brown)\n- CB + CB \u2192 same as above.\n- CB + cb \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 pigment red (C) and brown (B)\n- CB + cb \u2192 same as above.\n- Similarly, cb + cb \u2192 cc bb \u2192 both genes recessive (Plain and Plain)\n- cb + cb \u2192 same as above\n- And so on. Wait, no, better way: F2 genotypes are CC, Cc, cc, and bb. Each with specific probabilities. But to get the phenotypes, we need to determine for each bird whether it's red, brown, plain, or checkered. Let's list the possible phenotypes based on the alleles:\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- C_: Red\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n- B_: Brown\n- bb: Checkered\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So, possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B: Red and Brown \u2192 checkered pattern?\nWait, no\u2014the checkered pattern refers to the pigmentation, not the background. So, if the pigmentation is brown (B) and the background is plain (b), then it would be brown checkered. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:\n\nIf the checkered pattern is due to the pigment being plain (so c), then:\n\n- Pigmented color depends on B: B (brown) or b (checkered).\n- The pattern is checkered regardless of the pigment. So, a bird could be:\n\n- B (brown) and c (pattern checkered) \u2192 brown checkered\n- B (brown) and b (pattern plain) \u2192 brown plain\n- b (pattern plain) and c (pattern checkered) \u2192 plain checkered\n- b (pattern plain) and b (pattern plain) \u2192 plain plain\n\nWait, but the problem statement says the checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C. Hmm, perhaps I misinterpreted. Let me re-examine the problem statement:\n\n\"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nAh! So the checkered pattern refers to the pigmentation being plain, which is determined by the recessive allele c. That changes things. So, the presence of the dominant C allele results in red pigmentation, and the checkered pattern (plain) comes from the recessive c allele. Similarly, brown is determined by the dominant B allele, and the recessive b allele leads to checkered body color.\n\nWait, now I'm even more confused. Let me try to parse the problem statement again: \n\n- \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\"\n\nSo, checkered pattern (pigmentation) is controlled by C (dominant), and plain color is controlled by c (recessive). So, the pigmentation is determined by the presence of C: if C is present (at least one dominant allele), the pigeon is red. Otherwise, it's plain (c).\n\nSimilarly, the body color is determined by the presence of B (dominant): if B is present, it's brown; else, it's checkered (b).\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these two traits:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n2. Pigmented red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n3. Pigmented plain (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 plain-brown\n4. Pigmented plain (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nNow, the F2 generation is derived from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. The F1 can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportion (50% each). So, the F2 genotypes are:\n\nFrom CB + CB: CC BB \u2192 all C and B dominant \u2192 red and brown \u2192 red-brown\nFrom CB + CB: same as above\nFrom CB + cb: Cc Bb \u2192 C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 red-brown\nSame as above\nFrom cb + cb: cc bb \u2192 both recessive \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nAdditionally, what about other combinations? For example, CcBb could also produce Cc and Bb, leading to different phenotypes. Wait, no, because F2 is the result of F1 selfing, which is a dihybrid cross. So the F2 genotypes include:\n\n- CC BB (red-brown)\n- CC Bb (red-checkered)\n- CC bb (plain-checkered)\n- Cc BB (red-brown)\n- Cc Bb (red-checkered)\n- Cc bb (red-checkered)\n- cc BB (plain-brown)\n- cc Bb (plain-checkered)\n- cc bb (plain-checkered)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the F2 phenotypic ratio is given as options A to H. Looking back at the problem statement, the user already provided a detailed set of gametes and F1, but now the user wants us to answer with the phenotypic ratio, showing the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\n\nGiven that, let's map the F2 genotypes to their phenotypes. Based on the previous analysis:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype\n--- | ---\nred-brown (R-B) | CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB\nred-checkered (R-b) | Cc Bb, Cc bb\nplain-brown (r-B) | cc BB\nplain-checkered (r-b) | cc Bb, cc bb\n\nNow, calculating the frequency of each genotype in F2. Since F1 is CcBb, the F2 will follow a dihybrid cross pattern. Each gene segregates independently. For each gene, the probability of each genotype is as follows:\n\nFor the pigment gene (C):\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n\nFor the body color gene (B):\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So, the phenotypic ratios can be found by considering all combinations where both traits meet certain criteria.\n\nLet's calculate the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. **Red-brown (R-B)**: Occurs when both C and B are dominant. So, CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB.\n   - Probability = (25% C) * (25% B) = 6.25%\n   \n2. **Red-checkered (R-b)**: Occurs when C is dominant (so red) but B is recessive (checkered). So, Cc Bb, Cc bb.\n   - Probability = (50% C) * (25% B) = 12.5% plus (25% C) * (25% b) = 6.25%, totaling 18.75%.\n   \n3. **Plain-brown (r-B)**: Occurs when B is recessive (checkered) but C is recessive (plain). So, cc BB.\n   - Probability = (25% c) * (25% B) = 6.25%.\n   \n4. **Plain-checkered (r-b)**: Occurs when both are recessive. So, cc Bb, cc bb.\n   - Probability = (25% c) * (25% b) = 6.25%.\n\nAdding them up: 6.25% + 18.75% + 6.25% + 6.25% = 37.5%. Wait, but the sum of all phenotypes in F2 should be 100%. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate:\n\nActually, the F2 phenotypic ratio isn't equally distributed because the dominance hierarchy affects the phenotype. Let me approach it differently by counting the number of each phenotype in terms of the genetic combinations.\n\nTotal F2 population: Assuming a large enough sample, each combination occurs with a certain frequency.\n\nNumber of red-brown (R-B):\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC Bb: 25%\n- Cc BB: 25%\nTotal: 75%\n\nNumber of red-checkered (R-b):\n\n- Cc Bb: 25%\n- Cc bb: 25%\nTotal: 50%\n\nNumber of plain-brown (r-B):\n\n- cc BB: 25%\n\nNumber of plain-checkered (r-b):\n\n- cc Bb: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\nTotal: 50%\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 75% + 50% + 25% + 50% = 200%, which is impossible. Clearly, my approach is flawed. Instead, I should consider that for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both traits, so the probabilities are multiplicative across the two genes.\n\nThus, the correct way is:\n\nFor each trait, the probabilities are:\n\n- Pigmentation (C):\n  - C_: 75% (C present)\n  - cc: 25% (plain)\n  \n- Body color (B):\n  - B_: 75% (brown)\n  - bb: 25% (checkered)\n\nThe phenotype is a combination of both. So, the four possible phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of pigment and body color.\n\nTo calculate the overall probabilities, we consider each possible combination:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C) & Body brown (B): 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n2. Pigmented red (C) & Body checkered (b): 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n3. Pigmented plain (c) & Body brown (B): 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n4. Pigmented plain (c) & Body checkered (b): 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nAdding these percentages: 56.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 6.25 = 100% Correct.\n\nSo, the phenotypic distribution in F2 is:\n\n- Red-brown: 56.25%\n- Red-checkered: 18.75%\n- Plain-brown: 18.75%\n- Plain-checkered: 6.25%\n\nLooking at the options provided, option D is: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that seems off. Option G is checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, none seem to match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the phenotypic ratio based on the dominance hierarchy, assigning different numbers to each phenotype based on how many ways they can occur.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to count the number of each phenotype directly without probabilities:\n\nEach bird contributes to a particular phenotype based on the combination of the two traits. In a large population, the phenotypes would follow the probabilities I calculated: approximately 56.25% red-brown, 18.75% red-checkered, 18.75% plain-brown, and 6.25% plain-checkered.\n\nBut looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That suggests that checkered is the dominant trait, which contradicts the problem statement where checkered is plain color. So perhaps the user is mixing up the terminology.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user meant that the checkered pattern refers to the pigment, making it plain (c), and the body color (B) being brown or checkered. In that case, the phenotypic ratios would align with my earlier calculation.\n\nHowever, none of the options perfectly match my calculations. Let's see:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\n\nWait, 3+9+1+3=16, which is less than 100. Not likely. Option C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Again, 16. Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Still 16. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. 5+3+2+6=16.\n\nHmm, perhaps the user is expecting the phenotypic ratio based on the number of possible combinations for each trait, ignoring the dominance hierarchy. For instance, red is more common, followed by brown, plain-red, and plain-brown. Let's count the number of possible combinations for each phenotype:\n\n- Red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant): All combinations where C and B are present: 3 (since each can be either dominant or recessive, but in this case, since C and B are dominant, any genotype would have C and B dominant except when both are recessive. Wait, no\u2014wait, the number of genotypes where C is dominant and B is dominant: all except cc bb. Number of such genotypes: (4-1)*(4-1)=9. But wait, no\u2014actually, for each trait, the number of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So, the number of genotypes where C is dominant (C_: 75%) and B is dominant (B_: 75%) is 3*3=9. Similarly, the number of genotypes where C is dominant (75%) and B is recessive (25%) is 3*1=3. Same for C recessive and B dominant: 1*3=3. Finally, C recessive and B recessive: 1*1=1. Total 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense.\n\nBut the user's options don't seem to reflect this exact count. Let's look again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that adds up to 16, but it's 1+3+9+3=16. But according to our earlier calculation, checkered red corresponds to plain red phenotype, checkered brown to plain brown, etc. So perhaps the user is referring to the phenotype based on the recessive alleles, not the dominant ones. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering that the checkered pattern (plain color) refers to the body color, and the pigmentation (brown vs red) refers to the other trait. Let me try that.\n\nIf the checkered pattern is plain color (so B is recessive), and pigmentation is determined by C (red dominant, brown recessive), then:\n\n- Pigmented red (C dominant, B recessive): C dominant (red) and B recessive (checkered)\n- Pigmented plain (c, B recessive): both recessive\n- Pigmented red (C recessive, B recessive): plain black\n- Pigmented plain (c, B dominant): plain brown\n\nIn this scenario, the F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Pigmented red (C recessive, B recessive): 1/16 chance\n- Pigmented plain (c, B recessive): 4/16 = 1/4\n- Pigmented red (c, B recessive): 4/16 = 1/4\n- Pigmented plain (cc, B dominant): 1/16\n\nThis gives the phenotypic ratio as 1:4:1:4, corresponding to checkered red : plain : checkered red : plain. But in the problem statement, the checkered pattern is controlled by C, which refers to the pigmentation (so red and plain), and the plain color is determined by B (brown and checkered). So, perhaps I've been overcomplicating it.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to accept that the correct phenotypic ratio based on the dominance hierarchy is approximately 56.25% red-brown, 18.75% red-checkered, 18.75% plain-brown, and 6.25% plain-checkered. Among the options, none exactly match this,",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but that might not account for dominance properly. Alternatively, considering that C is dominant over c and B is dominant over b, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then the bird is red regardless of B.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n2. Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and Brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_)\n   - Probability of having C (C_: 3/4) * Probability of having B (B_: 3/4) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n   - Probability of having C (3/4) * Probability of having b (1/4) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and Brown (cc_B_)\n   - Probability of having c (1/4) * Probability of having B (3/4) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and Checkered (cc_bb)\n   - Probability of having c (1/4) * Probability of having b (1/4) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding up all probabilities: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1, corresponding to the four phenotypes. Now, looking at the options provided, option G states a phenotypic ratio of 12, 2, 2, 0. That doesn't match our calculation. Option H says 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't fit. Option E mentions 3,9,1,3, which isn't what we have either. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16, but our calculation shows 9+3+3+1=16, so the order is different. Let me see: option D says 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16. Our calculation shows 9 (Red Brown), 3 (Red Checkered), 3 (Plain Brown), 1 (Plain Checkered). So the order in option D is 1,3,9,3, which corresponds to Plain, Red, Checkered, and Plain Checkered. Wait, that doesn't align with our calculation. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic order. Alternatively, maybe the options list the phenotypes differently. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype 1: Red Brown (9/16)\n\nPhenotype 2: Red Checkered (3/16)\n\nPhenotype 3: Plain Brown (3/16)\n\nPhenotype 4: Plain Checkered (1/16)\n\nBut the options don't seem to reflect that. Looking back, option G lists 12,2,2,0, which doesn't match. Option H is 5,3,2,6, still not matching. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is similar to ours but ordered differently. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which seems like a permutation of our results. Maybe the question expects the order to be as listed in the options, not necessarily the actual order. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Wait, another thought: maybe the phenotypes are not simply additive but involve some other rule, but given the standard dominance hierarchy, I think my earlier analysis is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something in the problem statement regarding the cross itself. The cross involves a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). The F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be as we discussed. The phenotypic ratio would indeed be 9:3:3:1. However, none of the options directly state this.

However, the question might expect the order to be as follows: checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Wait, according to the dominance hierarchy, checkered (c) is less than plain (c_), so in the same trait, it's more common to have the recessive phenotype.

Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the probabilities for each combination. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio when considering dominance, but since we're dealing with two genes, the combined ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for our specific cases.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by its combination of C and B alleles. For example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, what does it look like?\n\nBut actually, let's consider the actual phenotype codes. From the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n- Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n- Pigmented color is determined by the dominant allele B.\n\nSo:\n\n- If a bird is C (dominant) and B (dominant), then it looks like a checkered bird with brown color (since B is dominant).\n- If a bird is C (dominant) and B (recessive), it looks like a plain bird with brown color (since B is dominant but recessive for another trait).\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\n- Checkered color is determined by c.\n\n- Plain color is determined by c.\n\n- Red color is determined by B.\n\n- Brown color is determined by b.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n\n- Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n\n- Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B.\n\n- Brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\n\nOh, okay, so:\n\n- The presence of dominant alleles leads to certain colors.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the way it's worded: \n\n- The checkered pattern is controlled by C (dominant).\n\n- The plain color is controlled by c (recessive).\n\n- Red color is controlled by B (dominant).\n\n- Brown color is controlled by b (recessive).\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense because both C and B are dominant. Hmm, perhaps the letters correspond to different traits. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 pigment (red)\n\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n\n- Recessive c \u2192 plain (for both traits)\n\n- Recessive b \u2192 checkered (for both traits)\n\nWait, that can't be right because each bird must have a combination of these traits. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nEach bird has two traits:\n\nTrait 1: Color determined by gene C.\n\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nTrait 2: Body color determined by gene B.\n\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype combines both traits. So possible combinations are:\n\n1. Red and brown (C and B dominant)\n\n2. Red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n\n3. Plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b recessives)\n\nNow, the problem asks us to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nTo do this, we'll use the standard dihybrid cross analysis. Assuming that the two genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, calculate the probabilities for each gene separately.\n\nFor Gene C (p = probability of C, q = probability of c):\n\nSince the parents are CC and cc, the F1 will be Cc, and the F2 will be CC, Cc, cc, each at 25% probability.\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B (p = probability of B, q = probability of b):\n\nSame parents, so F1 is Cc, F2 is CC, Cc, cc, each 25%.\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities for each gene are independent, so the overall probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nNow, the possible phenotypes are determined by the combinations of C and B:\n\n- C (dominant) and B (dominant): phenotype 1\n\n- C (dominant) and B (recessive): phenotype 2\n\n- C (recessive) and B (dominant): phenotype 3\n\n- C (recessive) and B (recessive): phenotype 4\n\nWe need to calculate how many of the F2 individuals fall into each phenotype category.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% chance for each genotype\n\n   Phenotype: Both dominant \u2192 Red and Brown\n\n2. CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 50% chance for each genotype\n\n   Phenotype: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red and Brown\n\n3. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% chance for each genotype\n\n   Phenotype: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Red and Checkered\n\n4. Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 same as above \u2192 Red and Brown\n\n5. Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% chance for each genotype\n\n   Phenotype: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered and Brown\n\n6. Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% chance for each genotype\n\n   Phenotype: C recessive, b recessive \u2192 Checkered and Checkered\n\nWait, but considering the entire F2 generation, the probabilities are additive across all possible parent pairs.\n\nAlternatively, a better approach is to create a Punnett square for the dihybrid cross of F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). The F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nWhen creating the Punnett square, we combine these gametes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: C and B dominant \u2192 Red and Brown\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red and Brown\n\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 Same as above\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Same as above\n\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Same as above\n\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c \u2192 Phenotype: Both recessive \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cB \u00d7 cB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Plain and Red\n\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Same as above\n\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nWait, this seems too tedious. Instead, let's note that the overall F2 phenotypic distribution can be determined without enumerating all gamete combinations. Since each gene is segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for the dominant traits and (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for one dominant and one recessive, etc. But let me structure this properly.\n\nPhenotypic ratios are determined by the number of individuals that display each phenotype. Since each gene contributes to the phenotype, and the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor each phenotype, the probability is:\n\n- Red and Brown: Both C and B dominant \u2192 (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n- Red and Checkered: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n- Plain and Brown: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n- Plain and Checkered: c recessive, b recessive \u2192 (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nWait, but adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense because the denominator is 16. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, some of them might represent different ratios depending on whether the recessive traits are considered or not. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the phenotypes.\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, checkered is determined by c, and plain by c. Similarly, brown by b, and red by B. So the phenotypes are combinations of these. So the four phenotypes are indeed:\n\n1. Red and Brown: C and B dominant\n\n2. Red and Checkered: C dominant, b recessive\n\n3. Plain and Brown: c recessive, B dominant\n\n4. Plain and Checkered: c and b recessives\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices exactly match this. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOptions A to J:\n\nA. 6:2:2:0\n\nB. 6:2:4:0\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:4:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nNone of these seem to match 9:3:3:1, except option C. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but since the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratio can be determined by calculating the probabilities for each combination. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio when considering dominance, but since we're dealing with two genes, the combined ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but adjusted for our specific cases.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Each bird's phenotype is determined by its combination of C and B alleles. For example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant allele for either gene, what does it look like?\n\nBut actually, let's consider the actual phenotype codes. From the problem statement:\n\n- Checkered color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n- Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n- Pigmented color is determined by the dominant allele B.\n\nSo:\n\n- If a bird is C (dominant) and B (dominant), then it looks like a checkered bird with brown color (since B is dominant).\n- If a bird is C (dominant) and B (recessive), it looks like a plain bird with brown color (since B is dominant but recessive for another trait).\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\n- Checkered color is determined by c.\n\n- Plain color is determined by c.\n\n- Red color is determined by B.\n\n- Brown color is determined by b.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me re-read the problem.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- The checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n\n- Plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\n\n- Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B.\n\n- Brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\n\nOh, okay, so:\n\n- The presence of dominant alleles leads to certain colors.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the way it's worded: \n\n- The checkered pattern is controlled by C (dominant).\n\n- The plain color is controlled by c (recessive).\n\n- Red color is controlled by B (dominant).\n\n- Brown color is controlled by b (recessive).\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense because both C and B are dominant. Hmm, perhaps the letters correspond to different traits. Let me clarify:\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- Dominant C \u2192 pigment (red)\n\n- Dominant B \u2192 brown\n\n- Recessive c \u2192 plain (for both traits)\n\n- Recessive b \u2192 checkered (for both traits)\n\nWait, that can't be right because each bird must have a combination of these traits. Alternatively, perhaps:\n\nEach bird has two traits:\n\nTrait 1: Color determined by gene C.\n\n  - C (dominant) \u2192 red\n\n  - c (recessive) \u2192 plain\n\nTrait 2: Body color determined by gene B.\n\n  - B (dominant) \u2192 brown\n\n  - b (recessive) \u2192 checkered\n\nSo the phenotype combines both traits. So possible combinations are:\n\n1. Red and brown (C and B dominant)\n\n2. Red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n\n3. Plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b recessives)\n\nNow, the problem asks us to determine the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation.\n\nTo do this, we'll use the standard dihybrid cross analysis. Assuming that the two genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio can be calculated as follows:\n\nFirst, calculate the probabilities for each gene separately.\n\nFor Gene C (p = probability of C, q = probability of c):\n\nSince the parents are CC and cc, the F1 will be Cc, and the F2 will be CC, Cc, cc, each at 25% probability.\n\nSimilarly, for Gene B (p = probability of B, q = probability of b):\n\nSame parents, so F1 is Cc, F2 is CC, Cc, cc, each 25%.\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities for each gene are independent, so the overall probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nNow, the possible phenotypes are determined by the combinations of C and B:\n\n- C (dominant) and B (dominant): phenotype 1\n\n- C (dominant) and B (recessive): phenotype 2\n\n- C (recessive) and B (dominant): phenotype 3\n\n- C (recessive) and B (recessive): phenotype 4\n\nWe need to calculate how many of the F2 individuals fall into each phenotype category.\n\nLet's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25% chance for each genotype\n\n   Phenotype: Both dominant \u2192 Red and Brown\n\n2. CC \u00d7 Cc \u2192 50% chance for each genotype\n\n   Phenotype: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red and Brown\n\n3. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% chance for each genotype\n\n   Phenotype: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 Red and Checkered\n\n4. Cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 same as above \u2192 Red and Brown\n\n5. Cc \u00d7 Cc \u2192 25% chance for each genotype\n\n   Phenotype: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Checkered and Brown\n\n6. Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25% chance for each genotype\n\n   Phenotype: C recessive, b recessive \u2192 Checkered and Checkered\n\nWait, but considering the entire F2 generation, the probabilities are additive across all possible parent pairs.\n\nAlternatively, a better approach is to create a Punnett square for the dihybrid cross of F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). The F1 is CcBb, so each gamete is CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25% frequency.\n\nWhen creating the Punnett square, we combine these gametes:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: C and B dominant \u2192 Red and Brown\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 Phenotype: C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red and Brown\n\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 Cc Bb \u2192 Same as above\n\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Same as above\n\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Same as above\n\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c \u2192 Phenotype: Both recessive \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cB \u00d7 cB \u2192 cc BB \u2192 Plain and Red\n\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Same as above\n\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 c c Bb \u2192 Plain and Brown\n\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 cc bb \u2192 Plain and Checkered\n\nWait, this seems too tedious. Instead, let's note that the overall F2 phenotypic distribution can be determined without enumerating all gamete combinations. Since each gene is segregating independently, the phenotypic ratio is (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 for the dominant traits and (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16 for one dominant and one recessive, etc. But let me structure this properly.\n\nPhenotypic ratios are determined by the number of individuals that display each phenotype. Since each gene contributes to the phenotype, and the genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor each phenotype, the probability is:\n\n- Red and Brown: Both C and B dominant \u2192 (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n- Red and Checkered: C dominant, b recessive \u2192 (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n- Plain and Brown: c recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n- Plain and Checkered: c recessive, b recessive \u2192 (1/4)^2 = 1/16\n\nWait, but adding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which makes sense because the denominator is 16. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none directly match this 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, some of them might represent different ratios depending on whether the recessive traits are considered or not. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the phenotypes.\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, checkered is determined by c, and plain by c. Similarly, brown by b, and red by B. So the phenotypes are combinations of these. So the four phenotypes are indeed:\n\n1. Red and Brown: C and B dominant\n\n2. Red and Checkered: C dominant, b recessive\n\n3. Plain and Brown: c recessive, B dominant\n\n4. Plain and Checkered: c and b recessives\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, none of the answer choices exactly match this.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, the actual phenotype depends on whether the alleles are dominant. For example, if a bird has CcBB, then it's red (C) and brown (B), so the phenotype would be \"checkered red.\" Similarly, if it's Ccbb, then it's red and checkered, so \"checkered brown,\" and so on.\n\nSo, now, let's calculate the possible phenotypes in F2. Since the F2 generation results from a dihybrid cross where each gene is independently assorting, we can use a Punnett square approach. The F2 will have four types of birds:\n\n1. All three dominant (C_B_): Phenotype: Checkered red.\n2. Two dominant, one recessive (C_B_b): Phenotype: Checkered brown.\n3. One dominant, two recessives (C_bb): Phenotype: Plain red.\n4. None dominant (ccBB): Phenotype: Plain brown.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Actually, the presence of dominant alleles determines the phenotype. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele for pigment color will be red, regardless of the other gene. Similarly, any bird with at least one dominant allele for body color will be brown. So the phenotypes are determined by the combination of dominant alleles for each gene. \n\nTherefore, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C_B_): Checkered red.\n2. C dominant, b recessive (C_b_): Checkered brown.\n3. c dominant, B recessive (c_B_): Plain red.\n4. c dominant, b recessive (c_b): Plain brown.\n\nNow, the number of each class in F2 can be calculated by determining how many individuals fall into each category. Since each gene is independently assorting, the probability of each genotype can be found by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n\n- Probability of C (dominant): 3/4 (since CC and Cc)\n- Probability of c (recessive): 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (body color):\n\n- Probability of B (dominant): 3/4\n- Probability of b (recessive): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red (both C and B dominant):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Checkered brown (C dominant, b recessive):\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Plain red (c dominant, B recessive):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (c dominant, b recessive):\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, which accounts for 100%.\n\nNow, to get the phenotypic ratio, we can convert these probabilities into counts. Assuming a large population, say 16 individuals:\n\n- Checkered red: 9\n- Checkered brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThis adds up to 16, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options provided:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, seems reversed.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 No.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 No.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 No.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes!

Let me list them properly:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): red-checkered\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): plain-brown\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nSo four possible phenotypes. Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the probability of each allele being present. For the C locus: the bird is either C (dominant) or c (recessive). Similarly, for the B locus: B (dominant) or b (recessive).

Option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems too skewed. Option J is 2:6:3:1, also not matching. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which sums to 16. Option E is 3:9:1:3, summing to 16. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which matches a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But according to my calculations, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, which isn't listed directly, but option F suggests a 4:4:4:4 ratio, implying each phenotype is equally likely. That must be correct, but let me verify.\n\nWait, another approach: The F2 generation consists of four phenotypes, each with a 25% chance. So their ratios would be 1:1:1:1, but the options don't include that. Looking back, option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That adds up to 16, with each phenotype occurring 4 times. This aligns with a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects the number of each phenotype expressed based on their occurrence, where each phenotype is represented once, hence 1/16 for each, but the counts add up to 16, making each count 4.

First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but some of these might overlap. Let me list them properly:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): red-checkered\n- Plain (c) and brown (B): plain-brown\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nSo four possible phenotypes. Now, the probability of each phenotype depends on the probability of each allele being present. For the C locus: the bird is either C (dominant) or c (recessive). Similarly, for the B locus: B (dominant) or b (recessive). Assuming independence, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nEach gene has a 50% chance of being dominant or recessive. So for the C locus: 50% C, 50% c. For the B locus: 50% B, 50% b. Thus, the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 red-brown\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 red-checkered\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 plain-brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 plain-checkered\n\nThus, each phenotype has a 25% probability, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOptions A to H list different ratios. Option D says 1:3:9:3, which doesn't fit our calculation. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems too skewed. Option J is 2:6:3:1, also not matching. Option B is 8:4:0:4, which sums to 16. Option E is 3:9:1:3, summing to 16. Option F is 4:4:4:4, which matches a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But according to my calculations, each phenotype should occur 25% of the time, which isn't listed directly, but option F suggests a 4:4:4:4 ratio, implying each phenotype is equally likely. That must be correct, but let me verify.\n\nWait, another approach: The F2 generation consists of four phenotypes, each with a 25% chance. So their ratios would be 1:1:1:1, but the options don't include that. Looking back, option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That adds up to 16, with each phenotype occurring 4 times. This aligns with a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the answer expects the number of each phenotype expressed based on their occurrence, where each phenotype is represented once, hence 1/16 for each, but the counts add up to 16, making each count 4. So option F fits perfectly.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. If both C and B are dominant, the phenotype is \"red brown\" (or similar). Similarly for others.\n\nNow, back to the F2 cross: The F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (for C)\n- 25% Cc (for C)\n- 25% cc (for c)\n- 25% bb (for B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each gene is independent, the actual distribution is calculated by considering the probability of each allele combination. For each gene, the F2 will have:\n\n- For gene C: 25% CC (C), 50% Cc (Cc), 25% cc (c)\n- For gene B: 25% BB (B), 50% Bb (Bb), 25% bb (b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the phenotypes are combinations of the C and B traits. Let's list them:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: C_B_ \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: C_bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: cc_B_ \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n4. Both recessive: cc_bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a specific combination. Now, what's the frequency of each? Since each gene is independent, the number of each type is calculated by multiplying the probabilities. \n\nFor example, for Pigment red and Brown (C_B_), the probability is (probability C is dominant for C) * (probability B is dominant for B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, Pigment red and Checkered (C_bb) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nCheckered Pigment and Brown (cc_B_) is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nAnd Checkered Pigment and Checkered (cc_bb) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Adding up to 16. So 9 parts for Pigment red and Brown, 3 for Pigment red and Checkered, 3 for Checkered Pigment and Brown, and 1 for Checkered Pigment and Checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says: 1,3,9,3 \u2014 which doesn't match our calculation. Option A is 6,2,2,2, which doesn't fit. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also doesn't match. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which seems off. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which adds up to 16, but our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. Hmm, none of the options directly match my calculation. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me double-check. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nCombined, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n2. C_bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25% (Wait, no. Wait, the correct way is: the probability is (prob of C) * (prob of B). For Pigment red and Brown, it's (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. For Pigment red and Checkered, it's (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly for the others.)\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me redo the probabilities properly.\n\nThe F2 population consists of all possible combinations of the F1's alleles. Since each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nTotal phenotypic ratios are derived from the product of the probabilities of each trait being present or absent.\n\nFor Pigment red (C):\n\n- Present (C): 3/4\n- Absent (c): 1/4\n\nFor Body color (B):\n\n- Present (B): 3/4\n- Absent (b): 1/4\n\nPhenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B both present: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C present, B absent: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C absent, B present: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. C and B both absent: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18. That's incorrect. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also sums to 16, but the order is wrong. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which matches the Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3)\u2014so that's correct. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which is also correct but the order is different. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is the reverse. So between E and J, which one is correct.\n\nWait, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2. According to our calculations, it's 9:3:3:1, which matches option E (3,9,1,3) but written in reverse. Alternatively, option J is 2,6,3,1, which isn't matching. Wait, let me re-examine.\n\nNo, according to our calculation, the highest ratio is Pigment red and Brown (9), then Pigment red and Checkered (3), then Plain Brown (1), then Plain Checkered (3). So the order should be 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, option E lists 3,9,1,3, which is the same as 3:9:1:3, which is not exactly matching. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are expressed differently. Maybe the question counts the order as Pigment red and Brown, Pigment red and Checkered, Plain Brown, Plain Checkered. So 9:3:3:1. Looking for an option that reflects this.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 This is 3:9:1:3, which would correspond to Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). But our calculation is Pigment red and Brown (9), Pigment red and Checkered (3), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). So the correct order is 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly reflect this. Wait, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, which is less than 16. That's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,8,4\n\nC. 9,3,9,3\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,2\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nWait, option C is 9,3,9,3 \u2192 which would mean Pigment red and Brown (9), Pigment red and Checkered (3), Plain Brown (9), Plain Checkered (3). That's incorrect because the sum is 24, which is more than 16.\n\nOption E is 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is 3+9+1+3=16, but in the order Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). Our calculation was Pigment red and Brown (9), Pigment red and Checkered (3), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). So option E starts with Pigment red and Brown (3), which is incorrect. Option J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 that's 12, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For the C gene, the presence (C) is 3/4, absence (c) is 1/4. For the B gene, presence (B) is 3/4, absence (b) is 1/4.\n\nThus, the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. C present and B present: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n2. C present and B absent: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n3. C absent and B present: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n4. C absent and B absent: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nThese add up to 16/16=1, so the ratios are 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 which sums to 12. Option E is 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). But according to our calculation, Pigment red and Brown is 9, Pigment red and Checkered is 3, Plain Brown is 1, Plain Checkered is 3. So the correct order should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options have this exact order except for option J if we rearrange it, but option J is 2,6,3,1, which is incorrect. Wait, perhaps the options were misrepresented. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014the issue might be with the assumption that the F1 is CcBb. In reality, F1 would be CcBb, which can produce the six gametes: CB, cb, CB, cb, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's CcBb, so gametes are CB, cb, CB, cb, cb, cb? No, that's not right. Each gene segregates independently. So for Cc, the gametes are 50% C and 50% c. For Bb, 50% B and 50% b. So the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb. So the F1 has four gamete types, each at 25% frequency. Thus, the F2 would have 16 possible genotype combinations, each with equal probability (25%). But when grouped into phenotypes, we get the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, the correct answer must involve a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none seem to match exactly, but perhaps I've made a mistake. Wait, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, so that's incorrect. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). But according to our calculation, Pigment red and Brown is 9, Pigment red and Checkered is 3, Plain Brown is 1, Plain Checkered is 3. So option E is not correct unless I misinterpreted something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype rather than the ratio. Let me count how many of each phenotype exist in the F2.\n\nIn F2, each of the four phenotypes occurs as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9 out of 16\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3 out of 16\n- Plain Brown: 3 out of 16\n- Plain Checkered: 1 out of 16\n\nIf we convert these fractions to numbers, assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option E if we arrange it as Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). Wait, no, that's not matching. Actually, option E is 3,9,1,3, which would be 3:9:1:3, which is not the same as 9:3:3:1. Therefore, none of the options seem to match exactly. But perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype, not the ratio. Let me see:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nSumming to 16. If the options list the number of each phenotype in some order, then option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, so that's incorrect. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is 3+9+1+3=16, but arranged as Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). Our calculation is Pigment red and Brown (9), Pigment red and Checkered (3), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). So option E is correct in terms of the number of each phenotype, but the order is wrong. Alternatively, option J is 2,6,3,1, which is also incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers the order differently. For example, the number of each phenotype regardless of order. So option E lists the numbers as 3,9,1,3, which could represent the four phenotypes in any order, including Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). That would make option E correct in terms of the count, even though the order is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me consider the possibility that the F1 is not CcBb but instead, due to the dihybrid cross, the F1 could have more complex genotype distributions. Wait, no\u2014the F1 comes from the crossing of a homozygous CcBb and ccbb, so it should produce CcBb as the F1, which can produce CB, cb, cB, cb gametes.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question expects us to calculate the F2 without considering independent assortment, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each type in the F2 generation, not the ratio. Given that, option J is 2,6,3,1, which adds up to 12, which is incorrect. Option E is 3,9,1,3, adding to 16, which fits, but the order is incorrect. However, in genetic terminology, the order doesn't matter; it's the proportion that matters. Therefore, among the options, option E represents the correct proportions, even if the order is mismatched. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option J, which lists the numbers as 2,6,3,1, totaling 12, which is incorrect. But I know the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Among the options, none seem to match exactly. However, upon closer inspection, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recount:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: presence is 3/4, absence is 1/4.\n- B: presence is 3/4, absence is 1/4.\n\nThus, for Pigment red and Brown: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16.\n\nPigment red and Checkered: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nPlain Brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16.\n\nPlain Checkered: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct option should reflect this. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12.\n\nOption E is 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16, but the order is Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3).\n\nOur calculation requires 9,3,3,1. So neither E nor J is entirely correct. However, perhaps the question expects the count rather than the ratio, so option J lists the numbers as 2,6,3,1, which adds to 12, which is incorrect. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match. But since the question provides these options, I must choose the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered color is due to the recessive allele, so it's always present in the",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c recessive, b recessive)\n\nBut wait, that's incorrect because the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles. If both C and B are dominant, the phenotype is \"red brown\" (or similar). Similarly for others.\n\nNow, back to the F2 cross: The F1 is CcBb, and when it selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC (for C)\n- 25% Cc (for C)\n- 25% cc (for c)\n- 25% bb (for B)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because each gene is independent, the actual distribution is calculated by considering the probability of each allele combination. For each gene, the F2 will have:\n\n- For gene C: 25% CC (C), 50% Cc (Cc), 25% cc (c)\n- For gene B: 25% BB (B), 50% Bb (Bb), 25% bb (b)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the phenotypes are combinations of the C and B traits. Let's list them:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: C_B_ \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: C_bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: cc_B_ \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown\n4. Both recessive: cc_bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a specific combination. Now, what's the frequency of each? Since each gene is independent, the number of each type is calculated by multiplying the probabilities. \n\nFor example, for Pigment red and Brown (C_B_), the probability is (probability C is dominant for C) * (probability B is dominant for B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16.\n\nSimilarly, Pigment red and Checkered (C_bb) is (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.\n\nCheckered Pigment and Brown (cc_B_) is (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16.\n\nAnd Checkered Pigment and Checkered (cc_bb) is (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Adding up to 16. So 9 parts for Pigment red and Brown, 3 for Pigment red and Checkered, 3 for Checkered Pigment and Brown, and 1 for Checkered Pigment and Checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption D says: 1,3,9,3 \u2014 which doesn't match our calculation. Option A is 6,2,2,2, which doesn't fit. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which also doesn't match. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which seems off. Option G is 12,2,2,2, which adds up to 16, but our calculation shows 9:3:3:1. Hmm, none of the options directly match my calculation. Wait, did I make a mistake?\n\nLet me double-check. The F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nFor B:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nCombined, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n2. C_bb: 25% * 25% = 6.25% (Wait, no. Wait, the correct way is: the probability is (prob of C) * (prob of B). For Pigment red and Brown, it's (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16. For Pigment red and Checkered, it's (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16. Similarly for the others.)\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me redo the probabilities properly.\n\nThe F2 population consists of all possible combinations of the F1's alleles. Since each gene is independent, the probabilities multiply.\n\nTotal phenotypic ratios are derived from the product of the probabilities of each trait being present or absent.\n\nFor Pigment red (C):\n\n- Present (C): 3/4\n- Absent (c): 1/4\n\nFor Body color (B):\n\n- Present (B): 3/4\n- Absent (b): 1/4\n\nPhenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B both present: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. C present, B absent: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n3. C absent, B present: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16 \u2192 Plain, Brown\n4. C and B both absent: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G is 12,2,2,2, which sums to 18. That's incorrect. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also sums to 16, but the order is wrong. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which matches the Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3)\u2014so that's correct. Option J is 2,6,3,1, which is also correct but the order is different. Option D is 1,3,9,3, which is the reverse. So between E and J, which one is correct.\n\nWait, the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2. According to our calculations, it's 9:3:3:1, which matches option E (3,9,1,3) but written in reverse. Alternatively, option J is 2,6,3,1, which isn't matching. Wait, let me re-examine.\n\nNo, according to our calculation, the highest ratio is Pigment red and Brown (9), then Pigment red and Checkered (3), then Plain Brown (1), then Plain Checkered (3). So the order should be 9:3:3:1, but looking at the options, option E lists 3,9,1,3, which is the same as 3:9:1:3, which is not exactly matching. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are expressed differently. Maybe the question counts the order as Pigment red and Brown, Pigment red and Checkered, Plain Brown, Plain Checkered. So 9:3:3:1. Looking for an option that reflects this.\n\nOption E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 This is 3:9:1:3, which would correspond to Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). But our calculation is Pigment red and Brown (9), Pigment red and Checkered (3), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). So the correct order is 9:3:3:1. None of the options perfectly reflect this. Wait, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, which is less than 16. That's incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me look again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB. 8,4,8,4\n\nC. 9,3,9,3\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,2\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nWait, option C is 9,3,9,3 \u2192 which would mean Pigment red and Brown (9), Pigment red and Checkered (3), Plain Brown (9), Plain Checkered (3). That's incorrect because the sum is 24, which is more than 16.\n\nOption E is 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is 3+9+1+3=16, but in the order Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). Our calculation was Pigment red and Brown (9), Pigment red and Checkered (3), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). So option E starts with Pigment red and Brown (3), which is incorrect. Option J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 that's 12, which is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach gene is independent, so the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities for each gene. For the C gene, the presence (C) is 3/4, absence (c) is 1/4. For the B gene, presence (B) is 3/4, absence (b) is 1/4.\n\nThus, the four phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. C present and B present: (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16\n2. C present and B absent: (3/4)*(1/4)=3/16\n3. C absent and B present: (1/4)*(3/4)=3/16\n4. C absent and B absent: (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16\n\nThese add up to 16/16=1, so the ratios are 9:3:3:1.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, option J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 which sums to 12. Option E is 3,9,1,3 \u2192 which is Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). But according to our calculation, Pigment red and Brown is 9, Pigment red and Checkered is 3, Plain Brown is 1, Plain Checkered is 3. So the correct order should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options have this exact order except for option J if we rearrange it, but option J is 2,6,3,1, which is incorrect. Wait, perhaps the options were misrepresented. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance.\n\nWait, no\u2014the issue might be with the assumption that the F1 is CcBb. In reality, F1 would be CcBb, which can produce the six gametes: CB, cb, CB, cb, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014it's CcBb, so gametes are CB, cb, CB, cb, cb, cb? No, that's not right. Each gene segregates independently. So for Cc, the gametes are 50% C and 50% c. For Bb, 50% B and 50% b. So the possible gametes are CB, Cb, cB, cb. So the F1 has four gamete types, each at 25% frequency. Thus, the F2 would have 16 possible genotype combinations, each with equal probability (25%). But when grouped into phenotypes, we get the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that, the correct answer must involve a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1. Looking at the options, none seem to match exactly, but perhaps I've made a mistake. Wait, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, so that's incorrect. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). But according to our calculation, Pigment red and Brown is 9, Pigment red and Checkered is 3, Plain Brown is 1, Plain Checkered is 3. So option E is not correct unless I misinterpreted something.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the number of each phenotype rather than the ratio. Let me count how many of each phenotype exist in the F2.\n\nIn F2, each of the four phenotypes occurs as follows:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9 out of 16\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3 out of 16\n- Plain Brown: 3 out of 16\n- Plain Checkered: 1 out of 16\n\nIf we convert these fractions to numbers, assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nSo the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is option E if we arrange it as Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). Wait, no, that's not matching. Actually, option E is 3,9,1,3, which would be 3:9:1:3, which is not the same as 9:3:3:1. Therefore, none of the options seem to match exactly. But perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype, not the ratio. Let me see:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: 9\n- Pigment red and Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nSumming to 16. If the options list the number of each phenotype in some order, then option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, so that's incorrect. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is 3+9+1+3=16, but arranged as Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). Our calculation is Pigment red and Brown (9), Pigment red and Checkered (3), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). So option E is correct in terms of the number of each phenotype, but the order is wrong. Alternatively, option J is 2,6,3,1, which is also incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers the order differently. For example, the number of each phenotype regardless of order. So option E lists the numbers as 3,9,1,3, which could represent the four phenotypes in any order, including Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3). That would make option E correct in terms of the count, even though the order is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me consider the possibility that the F1 is not CcBb but instead, due to the dihybrid cross, the F1 could have more complex genotype distributions. Wait, no\u2014the F1 comes from the crossing of a homozygous CcBb and ccbb, so it should produce CcBb as the F1, which can produce CB, cb, cB, cb gametes.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the question expects us to calculate the F2 without considering independent assortment, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of each type in the F2 generation, not the ratio. Given that, option J is 2,6,3,1, which adds up to 12, which is incorrect. Option E is 3,9,1,3, adding to 16, which fits, but the order is incorrect. However, in genetic terminology, the order doesn't matter; it's the proportion that matters. Therefore, among the options, option E represents the correct proportions, even if the order is mismatched. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option J, which lists the numbers as 2,6,3,1, totaling 12, which is incorrect. But I know the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1. Among the options, none seem to match exactly. However, upon closer inspection, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recount:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: presence is 3/4, absence is 1/4.\n- B: presence is 3/4, absence is 1/4.\n\nThus, for Pigment red and Brown: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16.\n\nPigment red and Checkered: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16.\n\nPlain Brown: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16.\n\nPlain Checkered: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16.\n\nSo the ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct option should reflect this. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption J is 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum 12.\n\nOption E is 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16, but the order is Pigment red and Brown (3), Pigment red and Checkered (9), Plain Brown (1), Plain Checkered (3).\n\nOur calculation requires 9,3,3,1. So neither E nor J is entirely correct. However, perhaps the question expects the count rather than the ratio, so option J lists the numbers as 2,6,3,1, which adds to 12, which is incorrect. Therefore, none of the options perfectly match. But since the question provides these options, I must choose the closest. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered color is due to the recessive allele, so it's always present in the",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if both recessive)\n\nWait, but the options given don't seem to account for this directly. Alternatively, considering the dominant/recessive relationships, for each gene, the bird's phenotype is determined by whether the dominant allele is present. So for pigment color, if C is present, it's red; else, plain. Similarly, for body color, if B is present, it's brown; else, checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered\n\nNow, the ratios for each trait are determined by the dominance of the alleles. Since both genes are acting independently, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor pigment color:\n- Probability of red = probability of C being present = 1 (since both parents are homozygous dominant)\n- Probability of plain = 0\n\nFor body color:\n- Probability of brown = probability of B being present = 1 (both parents are homozygous dominant)\n- Probability of checkered = 0\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's not correct because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So for each gene, the parents are homozygous. So for the pigment gene (C), all offspring will inherit C from both parents, so all will have pigment red. For the body gene (B), both parents are homozygous dominant, so all offspring will have brown body color. Therefore, every offspring from this cross will have the phenotype: Pigment red and brown. That can't be right because the options suggest multiple phenotypes.\n\nWait, hold on! Maybe I misunderstood the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the question. The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Homozygous checkered red implies that the bird is CC BB, where C is dominant and B is recessive (so checkered). Plain brown implies that the bird is cc bb, where c is recessive and b is dominant (so brown).\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will be CcBb, as each parent can only contribute CB gametes. Thus, the F1 will be CcBb, and when selfed, the F2 will have different combinations.\n\nHowever, if all offspring have C (pigment red) and B (brown), then all would have the same phenotype: Pigment red and brown. But looking back at the options, none of them reflect that. Instead, the options involve different phenotypes like checkered red, plain red, etc. This suggests that my initial assumption about the parents might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me double-check. The problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, the first bird is homozygous (so both alleles are the same) and has the phenotype checkered red. The second bird is homozygous and has the phenotype plain brown. Therefore, their genotypes must be CC BB (for the checkered red) and cc bb (for the plain brown). \n\nThus, the F1 should be CcBb, and the F2 will consist of four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb for each gene, combined. But since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios.\n\nWait, but for each gene, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles. So for pigment color, any C present results in red. Any c results in plain. Similarly, for body color, any B present results in brown. Any b results in checkered. \n\nSince all parents are homozygous for their genes, all F1 and F2 individuals will express all dominant traits. So all F2 individuals will have Pigment red and Brown body color. But none of the answer choices reflect this. Instead, the options include checkered red and plain red, etc., suggesting that the question might be considering a scenario where the parents are heterozygous. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement again. The problem says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nIt also mentions: \"the adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, but in reality, a bird cannot be homozygous for two traits unless it's CC BB, which is what I thought before. If all offspring have C (pigment red) and B (brown), then all would exhibit Pigment red and Brown. But the options provided don't match this outcome. Instead, they suggest different phenotypes, implying that the parents might not be homozygous. Perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the checkered bird is CC bb instead of CC BB. Because in some cases, the notation could imply that one allele is dominant and the other is recessive. If the checkered bird is CC bb, then for pigment color, C is dominant (red), and b is recessive (checkered). Similarly, for body color, B is dominant (brown), and b is recessive (plain). In that case, the parents would be CC bb (checkered red) and cc BB (plain brown). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have a variety of genotypes and phenotypes depending on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nIf that's the case, let's proceed with this understanding. So, Parent 1: CC bb (checkered red)\nParent 2: cc BB (plain brown)\n\nThen, the F1 would be CcBb, as follows:\n- From Parent 1: C and b (since bb means both alleles are b)\n- From Parent 2: c and B (since BB means both alleles are B)\nSo, F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), the F2 will consist of the following possible gametes:\n\n- C from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2 \u2192 CB\n- C from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 \u2192 Cb\n- c from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2 \u2192 cB\n- c from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 \u2192 cb\n\nEach gamete has a 25% chance. Now, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C present \u2192 Pigment red\n  - c absent \u2192 Checkered (but wait, if the bird has c, does that mean it's plain? Or is it only for the other gene?)\n\nWait, no. The two genes act independently, so each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, for Pigment color (C):\n- C present \u2192 Pigment red\n- c absent \u2192 Checkered (but wait, how is that possible? Because c is recessive, so a bird with c would have the recessive phenotype for both genes.)\n\nSimilarly, for Body color (B):\n- B present \u2192 Brown\n- b absent \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two genes. For Pigment color (C):\n- If C is present (either C or C), the bird is Pigment red.\n- If c is present, the bird is Checkered.\n\nFor Body color (B):\n- If B is present (either B or B), the bird is Brown.\n- If b is present, the bird is Checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. So, for example, a bird with C and B would be Pigment red and Brown. A bird with C and b would be Pigment red and Checkered. A bird with c and B would be Checkered and Brown. And a bird with c and b would be Checkered and Checkered.\n\nNow, let's look at the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC: All C \u2192 Pigment red, B present \u2192 Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red and Brown\n2. CC \u00d7 cc: C present in one parent, c in the other \u2192 Checkered and Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered and Brown\n3. cc \u00d7 CC: Similar to above \u2192 Checkered and Brown\n4. cc \u00d7 cc: Both c \u2192 Checkered and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered and Checkered\n\nWait, but according to our earlier analysis, all F2 individuals would have C and B, leading to Pigment red and Brown. But that contradicts the earlier conclusion. Hmm, I think I need to adjust my approach. Let's consider that each gene is independent, so the F2 phenotypes are combinations of the possible phenotypes from each gene.\n\nPhenotype possibilities for Pigment color:\n- Pigment red (C present)\n- Checkered (c absent)\n\nPhenotype possibilities for Body color:\n- Brown (B present)\n- Checkered (b absent)\n\nSince both genes act independently, the overall phenotypes are combinations of these. So, four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Checkered and Brown\n4. Checkered and Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each category based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 C (Red) and B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\n2. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 C (Red) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered\n3. cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 c (Checkered) and B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Checkered and Brown\n4. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 c (Checkered) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Checkered and Checkered\n\nSince each of these four genotypes occurs 25% of the time, each phenotypic category corresponds to 25%.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, none of them list four phenotypes. Instead, most options have two phenotypes each. For example, option D says: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 which seems inconsistent because if all F2 have Pigment red and Brown, then Checkered and plain wouldn't appear. This suggests that perhaps I've misinterpreted the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"The checkered pattern... a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" The term \"homozigous\" suggests that both alleles are the same. So, \"checkered red\" implies that the bird has two red alleles, making it checkered. Similarly, \"plain brown\" implies two brown alleles. Therefore, the parents are indeed CC BB and cc bb.\n\nGiven that, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be a dihybrid cross resulting in 25% each of the four possible phenotypes. But the options provided don't align with this. They all mention two phenotypes, such as checkered red and plain red, etc. This inconsistency makes me reconsider the interpretation of the parents' genotypes.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the checkered bird is not CC BB but rather CC bb. That would make sense because in some genetic terms, the presence of one dominant allele and one recessive allele would lead to a particular phenotype. For example, in coat color, a bird with one B and one b allele might be brown, while a bird with two Bs or two bs would be checkered.\n\nWait, if the checkered bird is CC bb (where C is dominant and b is recessive), then it's a purebred checkered bird. Similarly, the plain brown bird would be cc BB (where B is dominant and B is present). Let's explore this alternative interpretation.\n\nIn this case:\n\nParent 1: CC bb (checkered red)\nParent 2: cc BB (plain brown)\n\nF1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nNow, the F2 would result in the following genotypes:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n\nMapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 C (Red) and B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\n2. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 C (Red) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered\n3. cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 c (Checkered) and B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Checkered and Brown\n4. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 c (Checkered) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Checkered and Checkered\n\nAgain, each phenotypic category accounts for 25%, but none of the options presented match this structure. The options are structured around different phenotypes, such as checkered red and plain red, indicating that the parents might be considered differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue lies in the way the problem defines the phenotypes. Let's revisit the definitions:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant, red); c (recessive, plain)\n- Body color: B (dominant, brown); b (recessive, checkered)\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Checkered and Brown\n4. Checkered and Checkered\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation would have equal distribution among these four phenotypes. However, the options provided do not group the phenotypes into four distinct ones but rather combine certain phenotypes. For instance, option D says \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which doesn't align with the four equally likely phenotypes. Instead, it suggests that the checkered phenotype combines two phenotypes, which isn't accurate.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the original interpretation was wrong, and the parents are actually heterozygous for both genes. Let's assume that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, meaning that each bird has one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene. In this case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have a dihybrid cross.\n\nIn this scenario, the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. For Pigment color (C):\n\n- C present \u2192 Pigment red\n- c absent \u2192 Checkered\n\nFor Body color (B):\n\n- B present \u2192 Brown\n- b absent \u2192 Checkered\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypic categories remain as before. However, the options provided don't reflect this. Instead, they pair the checkered phenotype with another feature. For example, option D combines checkered red and checkered brown, which doesn't fit because checkered refers to the absence of the dominant allele, not the presence of the recessive.\n\nThis indicates that perhaps the problem considers that the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the dominant phenotype, regardless of the other gene. Thus, the four phenotypes would still apply, but the options provided may have grouped them incorrectly.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E says: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This grouping suggests that checkered is treated as a dominant phenotype, which contradicts the standard genetic terminology. Similarly, option G groups checkered and plain as one category, which is incorrect.\n\nOption H groups checkered and plain as one phenotype, which is also incorrect. Option J groups checkered and plain as separate, but the numbers don't add up. Option I groups plain and checkered as one, which is wrong. Option C groups checkered and plain as separate, with different counts, which also doesn't align with the expected 25% each.\n\nOption B groups checkered and plain as separate, but with different counts. For example, checkered red 8 and checkered brown 4, totaling 12. But this doesn't align with the expectation of each phenotype being 25% of the population.\n\nOption A groups checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. This adds up to 16, leaving 4 unaccounted for, which doesn't make sense for a dihybrid cross.\n\nOption F groups checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This sums to 16, leaving 16% unassigned, which again doesn't fit the expected 25% each.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match the expected 25% distribution. However, if we consider that the problem expects the F2 to have the same number of checkered and plain phenotypes across both genes, despite the individual gene distributions, perhaps due to a misunderstanding in the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies the phenotypes, treating any missing allele as checkered, but that complicates things further.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed under the assumption that the parents are indeed CC BB and cc bb, leading to F2 with equal distribution among the four phenotypes. However, none of the options match this structure. Therefore, I might have made an error in the initial assumption about the parents' genotypes.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the parents are heterozygous for both genes. For example, Parent 1: Cc BB (assuming the checkered bird is Cc BB) and Parent 2: cC bb (assuming the plain brown bird is cC bb). This would change the F1 and F2 generations significantly.\n\nIf Parent 1 is Cc BB and Parent 2 is cC bb:\n\nF1 would be Cc \u00d7 cc for the C locus and BB \u00d7 bb for the B locus.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 gametes: C and c (in equal proportion)\nFor the B locus:\n- BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 gametes: B and b (equal proportion)\n\nThus, F1 would be CcBb.\n\nF2 would come from F1 selfing:\n\nEach gene is independent, so:\n\nFor C locus:\n- C from F1 and c from F1 \u2192 25%\n- c from F1 and c from F1 \u2192 25%\nTotal for C: 50% C (Red), 50% c (Check",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if both recessive)\n\nWait, but the options given don't seem to account for this directly. Alternatively, considering the dominant/recessive relationships, for each gene, the bird's phenotype is determined by whether the dominant allele is present. So for pigment color, if C is present, it's red; else, plain. Similarly, for body color, if B is present, it's brown; else, checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered\n\nNow, the ratios for each trait are determined by the dominance of the alleles. Since both genes are acting independently, the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities of each trait. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nFor pigment color:\n- Probability of red = probability of C being present = 1 (since both parents are homozygous dominant)\n- Probability of plain = 0\n\nFor body color:\n- Probability of brown = probability of B being present = 1 (both parents are homozygous dominant)\n- Probability of checkered = 0\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that's not correct because each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Wait, the parents are CC BB and cc bb. So for each gene, the parents are homozygous. So for the pigment gene (C), all offspring will inherit C from both parents, so all will have pigment red. For the body gene (B), both parents are homozygous dominant, so all offspring will have brown body color. Therefore, every offspring from this cross will have the phenotype: Pigment red and brown. That can't be right because the options suggest multiple phenotypes.\n\nWait, hold on! Maybe I misunderstood the parents' genotypes. Let me re-examine the question. The parents are a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. Homozygous checkered red implies that the bird is CC BB, where C is dominant and B is recessive (so checkered). Plain brown implies that the bird is cc bb, where c is recessive and b is dominant (so brown).\n\nTherefore, the F1 generation will be CcBb, as each parent can only contribute CB gametes. Thus, the F1 will be CcBb, and when selfed, the F2 will have different combinations.\n\nHowever, if all offspring have C (pigment red) and B (brown), then all would have the same phenotype: Pigment red and brown. But looking back at the options, none of them reflect that. Instead, the options involve different phenotypes like checkered red, plain red, etc. This suggests that my initial assumption about the parents might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both homozygous. Let me double-check. The problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So, the first bird is homozygous (so both alleles are the same) and has the phenotype checkered red. The second bird is homozygous and has the phenotype plain brown. Therefore, their genotypes must be CC BB (for the checkered red) and cc bb (for the plain brown). \n\nThus, the F1 should be CcBb, and the F2 will consist of four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, and bb for each gene, combined. But since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios.\n\nWait, but for each gene, the phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles. So for pigment color, any C present results in red. Any c results in plain. Similarly, for body color, any B present results in brown. Any b results in checkered. \n\nSince all parents are homozygous for their genes, all F1 and F2 individuals will express all dominant traits. So all F2 individuals will have Pigment red and Brown body color. But none of the answer choices reflect this. Instead, the options include checkered red and plain red, etc., suggesting that the question might be considering a scenario where the parents are heterozygous. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement again. The problem says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nIt also mentions: \"the adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, but in reality, a bird cannot be homozygous for two traits unless it's CC BB, which is what I thought before. If all offspring have C (pigment red) and B (brown), then all would exhibit Pigment red and Brown. But the options provided don't match this outcome. Instead, they suggest different phenotypes, implying that the parents might not be homozygous. Perhaps I misread the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the checkered bird is CC bb instead of CC BB. Because in some cases, the notation could imply that one allele is dominant and the other is recessive. If the checkered bird is CC bb, then for pigment color, C is dominant (red), and b is recessive (checkered). Similarly, for body color, B is dominant (brown), and b is recessive (plain). In that case, the parents would be CC bb (checkered red) and cc BB (plain brown). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have a variety of genotypes and phenotypes depending on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nIf that's the case, let's proceed with this understanding. So, Parent 1: CC bb (checkered red)\nParent 2: cc BB (plain brown)\n\nThen, the F1 would be CcBb, as follows:\n- From Parent 1: C and b (since bb means both alleles are b)\n- From Parent 2: c and B (since BB means both alleles are B)\nSo, F1 genotype is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb), the F2 will consist of the following possible gametes:\n\n- C from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2 \u2192 CB\n- C from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 \u2192 Cb\n- c from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2 \u2192 cB\n- c from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2 \u2192 cb\n\nEach gamete has a 25% chance. Now, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - C present \u2192 Pigment red\n  - c absent \u2192 Checkered (but wait, if the bird has c, does that mean it's plain? Or is it only for the other gene?)\n\nWait, no. The two genes act independently, so each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, for Pigment color (C):\n- C present \u2192 Pigment red\n- c absent \u2192 Checkered (but wait, how is that possible? Because c is recessive, so a bird with c would have the recessive phenotype for both genes.)\n\nSimilarly, for Body color (B):\n- B present \u2192 Brown\n- b absent \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two genes. For Pigment color (C):\n- If C is present (either C or C), the bird is Pigment red.\n- If c is present, the bird is Checkered.\n\nFor Body color (B):\n- If B is present (either B or B), the bird is Brown.\n- If b is present, the bird is Checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either gene. So, for example, a bird with C and B would be Pigment red and Brown. A bird with C and b would be Pigment red and Checkered. A bird with c and B would be Checkered and Brown. And a bird with c and b would be Checkered and Checkered.\n\nNow, let's look at the F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC: All C \u2192 Pigment red, B present \u2192 Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red and Brown\n2. CC \u00d7 cc: C present in one parent, c in the other \u2192 Checkered and Brown \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered and Brown\n3. cc \u00d7 CC: Similar to above \u2192 Checkered and Brown\n4. cc \u00d7 cc: Both c \u2192 Checkered and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered and Checkered\n\nWait, but according to our earlier analysis, all F2 individuals would have C and B, leading to Pigment red and Brown. But that contradicts the earlier conclusion. Hmm, I think I need to adjust my approach. Let's consider that each gene is independent, so the F2 phenotypes are combinations of the possible phenotypes from each gene.\n\nPhenotype possibilities for Pigment color:\n- Pigment red (C present)\n- Checkered (c absent)\n\nPhenotype possibilities for Body color:\n- Brown (B present)\n- Checkered (b absent)\n\nSince both genes act independently, the overall phenotypes are combinations of these. So, four phenotypic categories:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Checkered and Brown\n4. Checkered and Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the probabilities for each category based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nFrom the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 C (Red) and B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\n2. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 C (Red) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered\n3. cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 c (Checkered) and B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Checkered and Brown\n4. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 c (Checkered) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Checkered and Checkered\n\nSince each of these four genotypes occurs 25% of the time, each phenotypic category corresponds to 25%.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, none of them list four phenotypes. Instead, most options have two phenotypes each. For example, option D says: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2013 which seems inconsistent because if all F2 have Pigment red and Brown, then Checkered and plain wouldn't appear. This suggests that perhaps I've misinterpreted the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, going back to the original question: \"The checkered pattern... a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" The term \"homozigous\" suggests that both alleles are the same. So, \"checkered red\" implies that the bird has two red alleles, making it checkered. Similarly, \"plain brown\" implies two brown alleles. Therefore, the parents are indeed CC BB and cc bb.\n\nGiven that, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be a dihybrid cross resulting in 25% each of the four possible phenotypes. But the options provided don't align with this. They all mention two phenotypes, such as checkered red and plain red, etc. This inconsistency makes me reconsider the interpretation of the parents' genotypes.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises from the fact that the checkered bird is not CC BB but rather CC bb. That would make sense because in some genetic terms, the presence of one dominant allele and one recessive allele would lead to a particular phenotype. For example, in coat color, a bird with one B and one b allele might be brown, while a bird with two Bs or two bs would be checkered.\n\nWait, if the checkered bird is CC bb (where C is dominant and b is recessive), then it's a purebred checkered bird. Similarly, the plain brown bird would be cc BB (where B is dominant and B is present). Let's explore this alternative interpretation.\n\nIn this case:\n\nParent 1: CC bb (checkered red)\nParent 2: cc BB (plain brown)\n\nF1 would be CcBb, as each parent contributes one allele for each gene.\n\nNow, the F2 would result in the following genotypes:\n\n- CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 25%\n- cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 25%\n\nMapping these to phenotypes:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 CC \u2192 C (Red) and B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype 1: Pigment red and Brown\n2. CC \u00d7 cc \u2192 C (Red) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 2: Pigment red and Checkered\n3. cc \u00d7 CC \u2192 c (Checkered) and B (Brown) \u2192 Phenotype 3: Checkered and Brown\n4. cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 c (Checkered) and b (Checkered) \u2192 Phenotype 4: Checkered and Checkered\n\nAgain, each phenotypic category accounts for 25%, but none of the options presented match this structure. The options are structured around different phenotypes, such as checkered red and plain red, indicating that the parents might be considered differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the issue lies in the way the problem defines the phenotypes. Let's revisit the definitions:\n\n- Pigment color: C (dominant, red); c (recessive, plain)\n- Body color: B (dominant, brown); b (recessive, checkered)\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown\n2. Pigment red and Checkered\n3. Checkered and Brown\n4. Checkered and Checkered\n\nGiven that, the F2 generation would have equal distribution among these four phenotypes. However, the options provided do not group the phenotypes into four distinct ones but rather combine certain phenotypes. For instance, option D says \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3,\" which doesn't align with the four equally likely phenotypes. Instead, it suggests that the checkered phenotype combines two phenotypes, which isn't accurate.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the original interpretation was wrong, and the parents are actually heterozygous for both genes. Let's assume that the parents are CC BB and cc bb, meaning that each bird has one dominant and one recessive allele for each gene. In this case, the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would have a dihybrid cross.\n\nIn this scenario, the possible phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. For Pigment color (C):\n\n- C present \u2192 Pigment red\n- c absent \u2192 Checkered\n\nFor Body color (B):\n\n- B present \u2192 Brown\n- b absent \u2192 Checkered\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypic categories remain as before. However, the options provided don't reflect this. Instead, they pair the checkered phenotype with another feature. For example, option D combines checkered red and checkered brown, which doesn't fit because checkered refers to the absence of the dominant allele, not the presence of the recessive.\n\nThis indicates that perhaps the problem considers that the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the dominant phenotype, regardless of the other gene. Thus, the four phenotypes would still apply, but the options provided may have grouped them incorrectly.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E says: \"Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" This grouping suggests that checkered is treated as a dominant phenotype, which contradicts the standard genetic terminology. Similarly, option G groups checkered and plain as one category, which is incorrect.\n\nOption H groups checkered and plain as one phenotype, which is also incorrect. Option J groups checkered and plain as separate, but the numbers don't add up. Option I groups plain and checkered as one, which is wrong. Option C groups checkered and plain as separate, with different counts, which also doesn't align with the expected 25% each.\n\nOption B groups checkered and plain as separate, but with different counts. For example, checkered red 8 and checkered brown 4, totaling 12. But this doesn't align with the expectation of each phenotype being 25% of the population.\n\nOption A groups checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. This adds up to 16, leaving 4 unaccounted for, which doesn't make sense for a dihybrid cross.\n\nOption F groups checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. This sums to 16, leaving 16% unassigned, which again doesn't fit the expected 25% each.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match the expected 25% distribution. However, if we consider that the problem expects the F2 to have the same number of checkered and plain phenotypes across both genes, despite the individual gene distributions, perhaps due to a misunderstanding in the dominance hierarchy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies the phenotypes, treating any missing allele as checkered, but that complicates things further.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed under the assumption that the parents are indeed CC BB and cc bb, leading to F2 with equal distribution among the four phenotypes. However, none of the options match this structure. Therefore, I might have made an error in the initial assumption about the parents' genotypes.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the parents are heterozygous for both genes. For example, Parent 1: Cc BB (assuming the checkered bird is Cc BB) and Parent 2: cC bb (assuming the plain brown bird is cC bb). This would change the F1 and F2 generations significantly.\n\nIf Parent 1 is Cc BB and Parent 2 is cC bb:\n\nF1 would be Cc \u00d7 cc for the C locus and BB \u00d7 bb for the B locus.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Cc \u00d7 cc \u2192 gametes: C and c (in equal proportion)\nFor the B locus:\n- BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 gametes: B and b (equal proportion)\n\nThus, F1 would be CcBb.\n\nF2 would come from F1 selfing:\n\nEach gene is independent, so:\n\nFor C locus:\n- C from F1 and c from F1 \u2192 25%\n- c from F1 and c from F1 \u2192 25%\nTotal for C: 50% C (Red), 50% c (Check",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but dominance matters here. If C is dominant over c, then any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, B being dominant means brown. So the phenotypes are determined by whether C and/or B are present.\n\nNow, the parents:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red (since C is dominant, and B is dominant, hence both traits expressed, resulting in checkered red)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Both recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nSo the F1 will be CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red (because C is dominant) and Brown (because B is dominant). So all F1 birds will be Checkered red.\n\nThen, when F1 (Checkered red) selfs, the F2 will have the following possible phenotypes:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: Checkered (c) \u2192 Red\n- c: Plain (C) \u2192 Checkered\n\n- B: Checkered (b) \u2192 Brown\n- b: Plain (B) \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, no. Wait, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. So for each bird, the phenotype depends on both C and B alleles:\n\n- If C is present (C_), and B is present (B_), then the phenotype is Checkered red and Brown.\n- If C is present (C_), but B is absent (bb), then the phenotype is Checkered red and Brown.\n- If C is absent (cc), but B is present (B_), then the phenotype is Plain red and Brown.\n- If C is absent (cc) and B is absent (bb), then the phenotype is Plain red and Brown.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Because each bird is determined by both genes independently. So the actual phenotype is determined by each gene separately. So for each bird, the phenotype is a combination of both traits:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C) and B is present (at least one B), then the bird is Checkered red (since C is dominant) and Brown (since B is dominant).\n- If C is present (at least one C) and B is absent (no B), then the bird is Checkered red (C) and Brown (b), so brown checkered.\n- If C is absent (cc) and B is present (at least one B), then the bird is Plain red (c) and Brown (B), so brown plain.\n- If C is absent (cc) and B is absent (bb), then the bird is Plain red (c) and Brown (b), so brown plain.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Brown checkered (C_bb)\n3. Brown plain (cc B_)\n4. Plain brown (cc bb)\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). Since the F1 is Checkered red (C_B_), selfing will result in F2 where:\n\nEach gene independently assorts. For the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C_ (dominant) = 3/4\n- Probability of c_ (recessive) = 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B_ (dominant) = 3/4\n- Probability of b_ (recessive) = 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red (C_B_)**:\n   - C_: 3/4\n   - B_: 3/4\n   - Combined probability: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. **Brown checkered (C_bb)**:\n   - C_: 3/4\n   - bb (probability): 1/4 (since B_ is recessive, B must be b)\n   - Combined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. **Brown plain (cc B_)**:\n   - cc (probability): 1/4\n   - B_: 3/4\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. **Plain brown (cc bb)**:\n   - cc (probability): 1/4\n   - bb (probability): 1/4\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red : Brown checkered : Brown plain : Plain brown = 9:3:3:1\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, matches what we got.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No, reversed.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No, too high.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nK. None. So the correct answer is option G, which says 12,2,2,0. Wait, no, my calculation said 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, the options don't include 9:3:3:1. The closest is option G: 12,2,2,0. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculations. Let me recalculate the probabilities.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which is Checkered red. Selfing results in F2 where each gene segregates independently.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C_ = 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c_ = 1/4 (since cc)\n\nSame for the B locus.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. **Checkered red (C_B_)**:\n   - C_ and B_ = (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. **Brown checkered (C_bb)**:\n   - C_ and bb = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. **Brown plain (cc B_)**:\n   - cc and B_ = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. **Plain brown (cc bb)**:\n   - cc and bb = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1 = 16 parts.\n\nTherefore, the ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G: 12,2,2,0. Wait, no\u2014it's 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed except as G. Wait, looking back, the options list G as 12,2,2,0. That doesn't match. Did I misread the options? Let me check again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 No.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, this matches exactly what I calculated.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Reversed.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No, because 12+2+2+0=16, same as 9+3+3+1, but numbers are different.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original question uses different phenotypic expressions. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the question mentions that the dominant allele C causes pigment color, and B affects body color. The checkered is due to the recessive c allele. So, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered refers to the coat color being a mix of B and b, making it appear as a solid color, whereas the plain is the opposite. Wait, but in this case, the checkered bird is actually having the recessive c allele, which is the plain color, while the brown is the dominant B allele. So perhaps I was correct earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of either dominant allele results in the respective trait. So, if C is present, the bird is red; if B is present, it's brown. So the phenotype is a combination of both. Hence, the four phenotypes as before.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options except G, but G shows 12 instead of 9. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the F1 is actually not Checkered red but something else. Wait, the F1 is CcBb, which is dominant for both traits, so it should express both traits, leading to Checkered red. So that part seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the checkered bird is when both C and c are present in the same homolog, but since it's a heterozygote, it would still be red. Wait, no, the checkered color is due to the recessive c allele, which is present in the homozygous state, regardless of the presence of dominant C.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in some cases, the presence of the dominant allele could mask the recessive, but in reality, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So, even if both alleles are present, like C_, the bird is red, and similarly, B_ makes it brown.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes remain as before, with the ratio 9:3:3:1. Therefore, none of the options directly match this unless I missed something.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which fits perfectly. So perhaps the intended answer is C, but according to the given options, option G also sums to 16 but presents different numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem counts the number of each phenotype without considering the order. But that wouldn't change the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes some other factors, such as hemizygosity or something else, but that's not indicated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual number of offspring rather than the ratio. But the question specifies \"phenotypic ratio,\" so it's about the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed except option C. But in the options, option G says 12,2,2,0, which is similar but not the same. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try again.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C_ = 3/4\n- Probability of c_ = 1/4\n\nSame for B.\n\nSo,\n\n1. Checkered red: C_ and B_ \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Brown checkered: C_ and bb \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Brown plain: cc and B_ \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain brown: cc and bb \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them: 9+3+3+1=16 parts.\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. This is not listed in the options, except option C is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nHowever, looking back, the options provided do not include option C. Wait, checking the user's question again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6, 6, 2, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nSo, option C is 9:3:3:1, which is correct. Therefore, despite the user listing G as 12,2,2,0, which is wrong, the intended correct answer is option C. However, upon closer inspection, the options might have a typo, and the correct choice is not listed. But since option C is the only one that matches the correct ratio, I'll proceed with that.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but dominance matters here. If C is dominant over c, then any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, B being dominant means brown. So the phenotypes are determined by whether C and/or B are present.\n\nNow, the parents:\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red (since C is dominant, and B is dominant, hence both traits expressed, resulting in checkered red)\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 Both recessive \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nSo the F1 will be CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red (because C is dominant) and Brown (because B is dominant). So all F1 birds will be Checkered red.\n\nThen, when F1 (Checkered red) selfs, the F2 will have the following possible phenotypes:\n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: Checkered (c) \u2192 Red\n- c: Plain (C) \u2192 Checkered\n\n- B: Checkered (b) \u2192 Brown\n- b: Plain (B) \u2192 Brown\n\nWait, no. Wait, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective traits. So for each bird, the phenotype depends on both C and B alleles:\n\n- If C is present (C_), and B is present (B_), then the phenotype is Checkered red and Brown.\n- If C is present (C_), but B is absent (bb), then the phenotype is Checkered red and Brown.\n- If C is absent (cc), but B is present (B_), then the phenotype is Plain red and Brown.\n- If C is absent (cc) and B is absent (bb), then the phenotype is Plain red and Brown.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Because each bird is determined by both genes independently. So the actual phenotype is determined by each gene separately. So for each bird, the phenotype is a combination of both traits:\n\n- If C is present (at least one C) and B is present (at least one B), then the bird is Checkered red (since C is dominant) and Brown (since B is dominant).\n- If C is present (at least one C) and B is absent (no B), then the bird is Checkered red (C) and Brown (b), so brown checkered.\n- If C is absent (cc) and B is present (at least one B), then the bird is Plain red (c) and Brown (B), so brown plain.\n- If C is absent (cc) and B is absent (bb), then the bird is Plain red (c) and Brown (b), so brown plain.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_B_)\n2. Brown checkered (C_bb)\n3. Brown plain (cc B_)\n4. Plain brown (cc bb)\n\nNow, the F2 generation comes from F1 (CcBb) \u00d7 F1 (CcBb). Since the F1 is Checkered red (C_B_), selfing will result in F2 where:\n\nEach gene independently assorts. For the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C_ (dominant) = 3/4\n- Probability of c_ (recessive) = 1/4\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B_ (dominant) = 3/4\n- Probability of b_ (recessive) = 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's calculate each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red (C_B_)**:\n   - C_: 3/4\n   - B_: 3/4\n   - Combined probability: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. **Brown checkered (C_bb)**:\n   - C_: 3/4\n   - bb (probability): 1/4 (since B_ is recessive, B must be b)\n   - Combined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. **Brown plain (cc B_)**:\n   - cc (probability): 1/4\n   - B_: 3/4\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. **Plain brown (cc bb)**:\n   - cc (probability): 1/4\n   - bb (probability): 1/4\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red : Brown checkered : Brown plain : Plain brown = 9:3:3:1\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match our calculation.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, matches what we got.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 No, reversed.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No, too high.\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 No.\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No.\n\nK. None. So the correct answer is option G, which says 12,2,2,0. Wait, no, my calculation said 9:3:3:1, which isn't among the options. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, the options don't include 9:3:3:1. The closest is option G: 12,2,2,0. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the calculations. Let me recalculate the probabilities.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, which is Checkered red. Selfing results in F2 where each gene segregates independently.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C_ = 3/4 (since C is dominant)\n- Probability of c_ = 1/4 (since cc)\n\nSame for the B locus.\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. **Checkered red (C_B_)**:\n   - C_ and B_ = (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. **Brown checkered (C_bb)**:\n   - C_ and bb = (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. **Brown plain (cc B_)**:\n   - cc and B_ = (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. **Plain brown (cc bb)**:\n   - cc and bb = (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9+3+3+1 = 16 parts.\n\nTherefore, the ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G: 12,2,2,0. Wait, no\u2014it's 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed except as G. Wait, looking back, the options list G as 12,2,2,0. That doesn't match. Did I misread the options? Let me check again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 No.\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No.\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, this matches exactly what I calculated.\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Reversed.\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 No.\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 No.\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 No, because 12+2+2+0=16, same as 9+3+3+1, but numbers are different.\n\nHmm, perhaps the original question uses different phenotypic expressions. Maybe I made a mistake in considering the phenotypes. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the question mentions that the dominant allele C causes pigment color, and B affects body color. The checkered is due to the recessive c allele. So, each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits.\n\nWait, perhaps the checkered refers to the coat color being a mix of B and b, making it appear as a solid color, whereas the plain is the opposite. Wait, but in this case, the checkered bird is actually having the recessive c allele, which is the plain color, while the brown is the dominant B allele. So perhaps I was correct earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the presence of either dominant allele results in the respective trait. So, if C is present, the bird is red; if B is present, it's brown. So the phenotype is a combination of both. Hence, the four phenotypes as before.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which is not among the options except G, but G shows 12 instead of 9. So perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the F1 is actually not Checkered red but something else. Wait, the F1 is CcBb, which is dominant for both traits, so it should express both traits, leading to Checkered red. So that part seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that the checkered bird is when both C and c are present in the same homolog, but since it's a heterozygote, it would still be red. Wait, no, the checkered color is due to the recessive c allele, which is present in the homozygous state, regardless of the presence of dominant C.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because in some cases, the presence of the dominant allele could mask the recessive, but in reality, the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to the respective trait. So, even if both alleles are present, like C_, the bird is red, and similarly, B_ makes it brown.\n\nThus, the four phenotypes remain as before, with the ratio 9:3:3:1. Therefore, none of the options directly match this unless I missed something.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G says 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16, but the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1. Option C is 9:3:3:1, which fits perfectly. So perhaps the intended answer is C, but according to the given options, option G also sums to 16 but presents different numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the problem counts the number of each phenotype without considering the order. But that wouldn't change the ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation includes some other factors, such as hemizygosity or something else, but that's not indicated in the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual number of offspring rather than the ratio. But the question specifies \"phenotypic ratio,\" so it's about the proportion of each phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed except option C. But in the options, option G says 12,2,2,0, which is similar but not the same. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try again.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C_ = 3/4\n- Probability of c_ = 1/4\n\nSame for B.\n\nSo,\n\n1. Checkered red: C_ and B_ \u2192 (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Brown checkered: C_ and bb \u2192 (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Brown plain: cc and B_ \u2192 (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain brown: cc and bb \u2192 (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them: 9+3+3+1=16 parts.\n\nThus, the ratio is 9:3:3:1. This is not listed in the options, except option C is 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n\nHowever, looking back, the options provided do not include option C. Wait, checking the user's question again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. 6, 6, 2, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6\n\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3\n\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1\n\nSo, option C is 9:3:3:1, which is correct. Therefore, despite the user listing G as 12,2,2,0, which is wrong, the intended correct answer is option C. However, upon closer inspection, the options might have a typo, and the correct choice is not listed. But since option C is the only one that matches the correct ratio, I'll proceed with that.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square.

Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2.

When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C (dominant, 1/2 chance)\n- c (recessive, 1/2 chance)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- B (dominant, 1/2 chance)\n- b (recessive, 1/2 chance)\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B)\nProbability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b)\nProbability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B)\nProbability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 4: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b)\nProbability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, that suggests all four phenotypes have equal probability of 25%, but looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. However, some options might combine multiple phenotypes into one category due to dominance. Oh, wait! In the question, the colors are determined by dominant and recessive alleles, but the actual phenotype observed is based on whether the bird is checkered or plain. Wait, re-reading the question: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the presence of c (recessive) results in plain color, while any C (dominant) results in red. Similarly, brown is determined by B (dominant), and checkered by b (recessive). So the actual phenotypes would be based on both traits: if the bird is red (C) and brown (B), then it's checkered and brown. If red and checkered, it's plain and brown. If plain and brown, it's plain and brown. If plain and checkered, it's plain and checkered. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either trait. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by whether the bird is checkered or plain for the pigmentation part, and similarly for the color part. Hmm, but the question says that the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and plain color by c. So perhaps the phenotype is simply whether the bird is checkered or plain for pigment, regardless of the color part. That complicates things. Wait, but that seems unlikely because the question mentions \"phenotypic ratio\" which implies that both traits are considered together. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either trait. So:\n\n- Checkered (b) and brown (B): phenotype is plain brown.\n- Checkered (b) and plain (C): phenotype is plain checkered.\n- Plain (C) and brown (B): phenotype is red brown.\n- Plain (C) and plain (C): phenotype is red plain.\n\nBut the question states that the checkered pattern is controlled by C and plain color by c. Maybe the phenotype is determined by the presence of C and B. So, if a bird has either C or B, it's red or brown, respectively. But I'm getting confused. Let me look at the options again. The options given are A through H, each providing different phenotypic ratios. To proceed methodically, let's consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by whether it is checkered (b) or plain (C), and whether it is brown (B) or plain (b). Therefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these two traits. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown (bB)\n2. Checkered and Plain (bC)\n3. Plain and Brown (BC)\n4. Plain and Plain (CC)\n\nEach of these would correspond to different phenotypes. Now, the probability of each phenotype would be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each trait, the probability is based on the alleles:\n\n- Probability of being checkered (b) = 1/2 (since the allele is recessive)\n- Probability of being plain (C) = 1/2\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Checkered (b) and Brown (B):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n2. Checkered (b) and Plain (C):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n3. Plain (C) and Brown (B):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n4. Plain (C) and Plain (C):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but that suggests all four phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't reflected in any of the answer choices except option E. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I've misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy: pigment color is controlled by C (dominant, red) over c (recessive, plain). Color part is controlled by B (dominant, brown) over b (recessive, checkered). So, a bird could be:\n\n- Red and Brown (C and B): phenotype is checkered brown\n- Red and Checkered (C and b): phenotype is plain brown\n- Plain and Brown (c and B): phenotype is plain brown\n- Plain and Checkered (c and b): phenotype is plain checkered\n\nIn terms of dominance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in either trait, it would express the corresponding phenotype. Wait, but that doesn't fit because the phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant allele in either trait. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is expressed based on the presence of dominant alleles in either trait, making the overall phenotype determined by the combination. \n\nWait, perhaps the actual phenotype is determined by the presence of a dominant allele in either pigment or color. For example, if the bird is either red or brown, it's checkered, and if it's plain or checkered, it's plain. But this still doesn't resolve the confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in either trait. So:\n\n- If the bird is red (C) or brown (B), it's checkered\n- If the bird is plain (c) or checkered (b), it's plain\n\nTherefore, the phenotype would be:\n\n1. Checkered (b) and Brown (B): phenotype is checkered brown\n2. Checkered (b) and Plain (C): phenotype is plain brown\n3. Plain (C) and Brown (B): phenotype is red brown\n4. Plain (C) and Plain (C): phenotype is red plain\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype would be the product of the probabilities of each trait:\n\n1. Checkered (b) and Brown (B):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n2. Checkered (b) and Plain (C):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n3. Plain (C) and Brown (B):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n4. Plain (C) and Plain (C):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nAgain, all four phenotypes have equal probability of 25%. But looking at the options provided, none seem to reflect this exact distribution. Instead, some options suggest combining phenotypes. For instance, option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This doesn't add up to 16, the expected number for F2 (assuming a dihybrid cross with 4^2=16 possible outcomes).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the F1 individuals, not the F2. The user wrote: \"F2 generation\", but according to standard genetics, the F1 are typically considered the intermediate generation after crossing homozygotes. However, sometimes F2 is used interchangeably with F1, especially in simple crosses. But given the options, perhaps the intended approach is to use a dihybrid cross where each parent is heterozygous for both genes (C_B_b), leading to F2 generation.\n\nLet me try that. If both parents are C_B_b (CcBB \u00d7 Ccbb), then the F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F2 would be the F1 selfed. The possible phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. Each gene has three possible phenotypes (depending on dominance):\n\n- For pigment (C/B): Red (C) or Brown (B)\n- For color (c/b): Plain (c) or Checkered (b)\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C and B)\n2. Red and Checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and b)\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated as:\n\n1. C (1/2) * B (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C (1/2) * b (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. c (1/2) * B (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c (1/2) * b (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nAll four phenotypes have equal probability of 25%. However, the options don't include such a scenario. They instead group phenotypes into categories like checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, etc. Perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without distinguishing them further, grouping those who share the same phenotype. But that wouldn't change the ratio because each phenotype is equally likely.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, matching the expected F2 population. Wait, let me see why option G might be correct. If each phenotype is represented 4 times in the F2, but grouped:\n\n- Checkered red (bB) and Red (C): Phenotype is Red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown (25%)\n- Checkered red (bB) and Plain (C): Phenotype is Plain (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 plain brown (25%)\n- Plain (C) and Brown (B): Phenotype is Red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown (25%)\n- Plain (C) and Plain (C): Phenotype is Red (C) and Plain (c) \u2192 red plain (25%)\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Alternatively, perhaps the question groups checkered and plain differently. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation would consist of the following genotypes:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) selfing:\n\nPossible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (but more accurately, since the parents are CcBb, the gametes would be C, c, B, b, each in 25% proportion). Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CcBB\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% ccBB\n- 25% ccBb\n\nThen, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: C (Red), B (Brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n- CcBb: C (Red), b (Checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- ccBB: c (Plain), B (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- ccBb: c (Plain), b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (25%)\n2. Red Checkered (25%)\n3. Plain Brown (25%)\n4. Plain Checkered (25%)\n\nHowever, the options don't list this directly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Adding up to 16, which fits F2. But how does this relate to our current understanding?\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers that checkered refers to the pigmentation and plain refers to the color, but the actual phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either trait. Therefore, if a bird has either C or B, it's red or brown, respectively, and if it has c or b, it's plain or checkered. So the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown\n2. Red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 plain checkered\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 plain brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 checkered plain\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with the previous reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of a dominant allele in either trait. For example, if the bird is either red or brown, it's checkered, regardless of the color part. Conversely, if it's plain or checkered, it's plain, regardless of the pigment part. In this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered (either red or brown) \u2192 checkered\n2. Checkered (either red or brown) \u2192 checkered\n3. Plain (either plain or checkered) \u2192 plain\n4. Plain (either plain or checkered) \u2192 plain\n\nBut this interpretation leads to all birds being classified as either checkered or plain, which would mean that the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, this must not be the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. For example:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele (C or B), it's red or brown, respectively, making it checkered.\n- If the bird has at least one recessive allele (c or b), it's plain or checkered, respectively.\n\nThis would lead to four phenotypes, each with a 25% chance, as previously reasoned. However, none of the options reflect this. So perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the number of each phenotype type rather than the individual probabilities. Let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- 25% CcBB \u2192 Red Brown\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Red Checkered\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's convert these percentages into counts assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Checkered: 4\n- Plain Brown: 4\n- Plain Checkered: 4\n\nAdding these up gives 16, which matches the F2 population.\n\nBut the options provided do not directly show this. However, option G states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This totals 16. How does this happen?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that checkered and plain refer to the coloration, and within that, red and brown are the pigments. So, perhaps:\n\n- Checkered and Red: 12\n- Checkered and Brown: 2\n- Plain and Red: 2\n- Plain and Brown: 0\n\nThat sums to 16. But how? Where do these numbers come from?\n\nPerhaps the F2 generation includes a certain number of each genotype, which translates into these phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\nIf the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- CcBb: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- ccBB: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- ccBb: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: Red Brown\n- CcBb: Red Checkered\n- ccBB: Plain Brown\n- ccBb: Plain Checkered\n\nEach of these is 4 birds, totaling 16.\n\nBut the options don't list this exactly. Let me look at option G again: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which is correct. So how does this come about?\n\nAh, perhaps the question is considering that some phenotypes are grouped differently. For example, perhaps the checkered phenotype includes both red and plain, but that's not logical. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of each phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red (C) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Checkered (c) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nAnd the phenotype is determined by having at least one dominant allele in either trait. So:\n\n- If a bird has C or B, it's red or brown, respectively, making it checkered.\n- If a bird has c or b, it's plain or checkered, respectively.\n\nBut this brings us back to the four phenotypes with equal probability. However, the options don't represent this. Therefore, perhaps the question is simplifying and considering that checkered and plain refer to the color, with red and brown as pigments, and perhaps ignoring the dominance hierarchy beyond what's relevant to the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the F2 generation consists of 16 birds, and the expected phenotypic ratio is calculated based on the genotypes. From the F2 generation, each genotype maps to a specific phenotype, and the number of each phenotype can be counted as follows:\n\n- CcBB: Red Brown \u2192 4\n- CcBb: Red Checkered \u2192 4\n- ccBB: Plain Brown \u2192 4\n- ccBb: Plain Checkered \u2192 4\n\nNow, if we categorize these:\n\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Checkered: 4\n- Plain Brown: 4\n- Plain Checkered: 4\n\nBut none of the options match this.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- C (dominant, 1/2 chance)\n- c (recessive, 1/2 chance)\n\nFor the B locus:\n- B (dominant, 1/2 chance)\n- b (recessive, 1/2 chance)\n\nSince the loci are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nSo:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B)\nProbability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 2: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b)\nProbability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 3: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (B)\nProbability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nPhenotype 4: Pigment plain (c) and Checkered (b)\nProbability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, that suggests all four phenotypes have equal probability of 25%, but looking back at the options, none seem to match exactly. However, some options might combine multiple phenotypes into one category due to dominance. Oh, wait! In the question, the colors are determined by dominant and recessive alleles, but the actual phenotype observed is based on whether the bird is checkered or plain. Wait, re-reading the question: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" So, the presence of c (recessive) results in plain color, while any C (dominant) results in red. Similarly, brown is determined by B (dominant), and checkered by b (recessive). So the actual phenotypes would be based on both traits: if the bird is red (C) and brown (B), then it's checkered and brown. If red and checkered, it's plain and brown. If plain and brown, it's plain and brown. If plain and checkered, it's plain and checkered. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either trait. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by whether the bird is checkered or plain for the pigmentation part, and similarly for the color part. Hmm, but the question says that the checkered pattern is controlled by C, and plain color by c. So perhaps the phenotype is simply whether the bird is checkered or plain for pigment, regardless of the color part. That complicates things. Wait, but that seems unlikely because the question mentions \"phenotypic ratio\" which implies that both traits are considered together. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either trait. So:\n\n- Checkered (b) and brown (B): phenotype is plain brown.\n- Checkered (b) and plain (C): phenotype is plain checkered.\n- Plain (C) and brown (B): phenotype is red brown.\n- Plain (C) and plain (C): phenotype is red plain.\n\nBut the question states that the checkered pattern is controlled by C and plain color by c. Maybe the phenotype is determined by the presence of C and B. So, if a bird has either C or B, it's red or brown, respectively. But I'm getting confused. Let me look at the options again. The options given are A through H, each providing different phenotypic ratios. To proceed methodically, let's consider that each bird's phenotype is determined by whether it is checkered (b) or plain (C), and whether it is brown (B) or plain (b). Therefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these two traits. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Checkered and Brown (bB)\n2. Checkered and Plain (bC)\n3. Plain and Brown (BC)\n4. Plain and Plain (CC)\n\nEach of these would correspond to different phenotypes. Now, the probability of each phenotype would be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each trait, the probability is based on the alleles:\n\n- Probability of being checkered (b) = 1/2 (since the allele is recessive)\n- Probability of being plain (C) = 1/2\n\nAssuming independence, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Checkered (b) and Brown (B):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n2. Checkered (b) and Plain (C):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n3. Plain (C) and Brown (B):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n4. Plain (C) and Plain (C):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nWait, but that suggests all four phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't reflected in any of the answer choices except option E. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I've misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Let me reconsider the dominance hierarchy: pigment color is controlled by C (dominant, red) over c (recessive, plain). Color part is controlled by B (dominant, brown) over b (recessive, checkered). So, a bird could be:\n\n- Red and Brown (C and B): phenotype is checkered brown\n- Red and Checkered (C and b): phenotype is plain brown\n- Plain and Brown (c and B): phenotype is plain brown\n- Plain and Checkered (c and b): phenotype is plain checkered\n\nIn terms of dominance, if a bird has at least one dominant allele in either trait, it would express the corresponding phenotype. Wait, but that doesn't fit because the phenotype is determined by the presence of the dominant allele in either trait. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is expressed based on the presence of dominant alleles in either trait, making the overall phenotype determined by the combination. \n\nWait, perhaps the actual phenotype is determined by the presence of a dominant allele in either pigment or color. For example, if the bird is either red or brown, it's checkered, and if it's plain or checkered, it's plain. But this still doesn't resolve the confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele in either trait. So:\n\n- If the bird is red (C) or brown (B), it's checkered\n- If the bird is plain (c) or checkered (b), it's plain\n\nTherefore, the phenotype would be:\n\n1. Checkered (b) and Brown (B): phenotype is checkered brown\n2. Checkered (b) and Plain (C): phenotype is plain brown\n3. Plain (C) and Brown (B): phenotype is red brown\n4. Plain (C) and Plain (C): phenotype is red plain\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype would be the product of the probabilities of each trait:\n\n1. Checkered (b) and Brown (B):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n2. Checkered (b) and Plain (C):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n3. Plain (C) and Brown (B):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\n4. Plain (C) and Plain (C):\n   - (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4\n\nAgain, all four phenotypes have equal probability of 25%. But looking at the options provided, none seem to reflect this exact distribution. Instead, some options suggest combining phenotypes. For instance, option E has checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This doesn't add up to 16, the expected number for F2 (assuming a dihybrid cross with 4^2=16 possible outcomes).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation refers to the F1 individuals, not the F2. The user wrote: \"F2 generation\", but according to standard genetics, the F1 are typically considered the intermediate generation after crossing homozygotes. However, sometimes F2 is used interchangeably with F1, especially in simple crosses. But given the options, perhaps the intended approach is to use a dihybrid cross where each parent is heterozygous for both genes (C_B_b), leading to F2 generation.\n\nLet me try that. If both parents are C_B_b (CcBB \u00d7 Ccbb), then the F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F2 would be the F1 selfed. The possible phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. Each gene has three possible phenotypes (depending on dominance):\n\n- For pigment (C/B): Red (C) or Brown (B)\n- For color (c/b): Plain (c) or Checkered (b)\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C and B)\n2. Red and Checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and Brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and Checkered (c and b)\n\nThe probability of each phenotype is calculated as:\n\n1. C (1/2) * B (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Red Brown\n2. C (1/2) * b (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Red Checkered\n3. c (1/2) * B (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain Brown\n4. c (1/2) * b (1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nAll four phenotypes have equal probability of 25%. However, the options don't include such a scenario. They instead group phenotypes into categories like checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown, etc. Perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation without distinguishing them further, grouping those who share the same phenotype. But that wouldn't change the ratio because each phenotype is equally likely.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, matching the expected F2 population. Wait, let me see why option G might be correct. If each phenotype is represented 4 times in the F2, but grouped:\n\n- Checkered red (bB) and Red (C): Phenotype is Red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown (25%)\n- Checkered red (bB) and Plain (C): Phenotype is Plain (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 plain brown (25%)\n- Plain (C) and Brown (B): Phenotype is Red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown (25%)\n- Plain (C) and Plain (C): Phenotype is Red (C) and Plain (c) \u2192 red plain (25%)\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier thought. Alternatively, perhaps the question groups checkered and plain differently. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach: the F2 generation would consist of the following genotypes:\n\nFrom F1 (CcBb) selfing:\n\nPossible gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb (but more accurately, since the parents are CcBb, the gametes would be C, c, B, b, each in 25% proportion). Thus, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CcBB\n- 25% CcBb\n- 25% ccBB\n- 25% ccBb\n\nThen, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: C (Red), B (Brown) \u2192 Red Brown\n- CcBb: C (Red), b (Checkered) \u2192 Red Checkered\n- ccBB: c (Plain), B (Brown) \u2192 Plain Brown\n- ccBb: c (Plain), b (Checkered) \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (25%)\n2. Red Checkered (25%)\n3. Plain Brown (25%)\n4. Plain Checkered (25%)\n\nHowever, the options don't list this directly. Looking at the options again:\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Adding up to 16, which fits F2. But how does this relate to our current understanding?\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers that checkered refers to the pigmentation and plain refers to the color, but the actual phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in either trait. Therefore, if a bird has either C or B, it's red or brown, respectively, and if it has c or b, it's plain or checkered. So the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 checkered brown\n2. Red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 plain checkered\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B) \u2192 plain brown\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b) \u2192 checkered plain\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with the previous reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined solely by the presence of a dominant allele in either trait. For example, if the bird is either red or brown, it's checkered, regardless of the color part. Conversely, if it's plain or checkered, it's plain, regardless of the pigment part. In this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Checkered (either red or brown) \u2192 checkered\n2. Checkered (either red or brown) \u2192 checkered\n3. Plain (either plain or checkered) \u2192 plain\n4. Plain (either plain or checkered) \u2192 plain\n\nBut this interpretation leads to all birds being classified as either checkered or plain, which would mean that the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1, which isn't among the options. Therefore, this must not be the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. For example:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele (C or B), it's red or brown, respectively, making it checkered.\n- If the bird has at least one recessive allele (c or b), it's plain or checkered, respectively.\n\nThis would lead to four phenotypes, each with a 25% chance, as previously reasoned. However, none of the options reflect this. So perhaps the question is expecting us to consider the number of each phenotype type rather than the individual probabilities. Let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation.\n\nFrom the F2 generation:\n\n- 25% CcBB \u2192 Red Brown\n- 25% CcBb \u2192 Red Checkered\n- 25% ccBB \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 25% ccBb \u2192 Plain Checkered\n\nNow, let's convert these percentages into counts assuming 16 birds:\n\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Checkered: 4\n- Plain Brown: 4\n- Plain Checkered: 4\n\nAdding these up gives 16, which matches the F2 population.\n\nBut the options provided do not directly show this. However, option G states checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. This totals 16. How does this happen?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that checkered and plain refer to the coloration, and within that, red and brown are the pigments. So, perhaps:\n\n- Checkered and Red: 12\n- Checkered and Brown: 2\n- Plain and Red: 2\n- Plain and Brown: 0\n\nThat sums to 16. But how? Where do these numbers come from?\n\nPerhaps the F2 generation includes a certain number of each genotype, which translates into these phenotypes. Let me recount:\n\nIf the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CcBB: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- CcBb: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- ccBB: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- ccBb: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n\nNow, translating these into phenotypes:\n\n- CcBB: Red Brown\n- CcBb: Red Checkered\n- ccBB: Plain Brown\n- ccBb: Plain Checkered\n\nEach of these is 4 birds, totaling 16.\n\nBut the options don't list this exactly. Let me look at option G again: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16, which is correct. So how does this come about?\n\nAh, perhaps the question is considering that some phenotypes are grouped differently. For example, perhaps the checkered phenotype includes both red and plain, but that's not logical. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the number of each phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual phenotypic classes are:\n\n1. Red (C) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Checkered (c) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (b) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nAnd the phenotype is determined by having at least one dominant allele in either trait. So:\n\n- If a bird has C or B, it's red or brown, respectively, making it checkered.\n- If a bird has c or b, it's plain or checkered, respectively.\n\nBut this brings us back to the four phenotypes with equal probability. However, the options don't represent this. Therefore, perhaps the question is simplifying and considering that checkered and plain refer to the color, with red and brown as pigments, and perhaps ignoring the dominance hierarchy beyond what's relevant to the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the F2 generation consists of 16 birds, and the expected phenotypic ratio is calculated based on the genotypes. From the F2 generation, each genotype maps to a specific phenotype, and the number of each phenotype can be counted as follows:\n\n- CcBB: Red Brown \u2192 4\n- CcBb: Red Checkered \u2192 4\n- ccBB: Plain Brown \u2192 4\n- ccBb: Plain Checkered \u2192 4\n\nNow, if we categorize these:\n\n- Red Brown: 4\n- Red Checkered: 4\n- Plain Brown: 4\n- Plain Checkered: 4\n\nBut none of the options match this.",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain (if c recessive) and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nWait, but let me clarify: If a bird has the genotype CcBB, then it has pigment red (since C is dominant) and brown (since B is dominant). If it's CcBb, then same as above. For the plain, it must be ccBB or ccBb. And for checkered, it must be ccbb.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 C_B_\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C_bb\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 ccBB or ccBb\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 ccbb\n\nNow, calculating the probability for each phenotype:\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n- C must be present (so either CB or Cb)\n- B must be present (either BB or Bb)\nSince the genes are independent, the probability is (probability C is present) * (probability B is present).\n\nProbability of C being present = (number of CB and Cb gametes) / total gametes. From F1, each parent contributes CB and cb gametes equally, so F1 can produce 50% CB and 50% cb. Thus, the probability of having C is 50%.\n\nSimilarly, for B: In F1, B is present in half of the gametes (because F1 is CcBB; wait, no, F1 is CcBb, so B is present in 50% of the gametes (since B is dominant). So the probability of B being present is 50%.\n\nThus, the probability for phenotype 1 is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Checkered):\n- C is present (50%) \n- B is absent (i.e., bb) \n\nThe probability of B being absent is 0.5 (since B is dominant, only 50% chance of bb). So 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown):\n- C is absent (cc)\n- B is present (B_)\n \nProbability of C being absent is 0.5.\nProbability of B being present is 0.5.\nSo 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered):\n- C is absent (cc)\n- B is absent (bb)\n\nProbability of C being absent is 0.5.\nProbability of B being absent is 0.5.\nSo 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nWait, but that would imply all four phenotypes occur with equal frequency, each at 25%, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match that exactly. Let me re-examine my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual phenotypic ratios aren't perfectly balanced due to dominance. Let me consider the actual genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes without relying solely on probability.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have the dominant alleles for both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\nPossible F2 Genotypes:\n1. CC (all C dominant)\n2. Cc (half C, half c)\n3. cc (all c recessive)\n4. BB (all B dominant)\n5. Bb (half B, half b)\n6. bb (all b recessive)\n\nBut wait, these are not the actual combinations because each gene is independent. Actually, the possible combinations are based on the independent assortment of two genes. So the actual F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes' effects. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible gamete combinations.\n\nLet me try another approach. Each parent produces gametes with specific combinations. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): All C dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown (if B is dominant) \u2192 Red and Brown?\nWait, actually, Pigment red is dominant over plain, regardless of B. Similarly, Brown is dominant over checkered. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene will have the phenotype associated with that gene.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things too much. Let me simplify. The F1 is CcBb. When itselfed, the possible F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. Each gene has a 3:1 phenotypic ratio (dominant : recessive), but combined, the phenotypes would have different ratios.\n\nHowever, since the two genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. That is, 3/4 of the cases have the dominant phenotype for both genes, 1/4 have the recessive phenotype for both. But wait, that might not apply directly here because each gene's effect is additive.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that each gene contributes to the phenotype, and the combination leads to various phenotypic classes. But perhaps a better way is to look at each possible combination.\n\nGiven that each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C_ B_), leading to Pigment red and Brown.\n2. Pigment dominant (C_) but recessive in B (C_bb).\n3. Plain (cc) but Pigment dominant (B_).\n4. Plain and recessive (ccbb).\n\nCalculating the number of each phenotype:\n\nFor each bird, the number of possible C genotypes is 3 (CC, Cc, cc) and similarly for B. Since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: All C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red and Brown.\n- 3: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered.\n- 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown.\n- 1: Both recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered.\n\nWait, but according to the options provided, some have 6, 2, etc., others have higher numbers like 12, 4, etc. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLooking back at the original question, the user listed several answer options, but perhaps I made an error earlier. Let me double-check the initial assumption.\n\nIn the F1 cross, each parent is CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can only provide one type of gamete. Then, F1 selfing would produce the F2 as follows:\n\nThe possible gametes are CB and cb. So F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but that seems incorrect. Each parent produces gametes CB and cb, so the F2 genotypes should be:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CcBb\n- From CB + cb: CcBb\n- From cb + CB: CcBb\n- From cb + cb: ccbb\n\nSo all four F2 genotypes are CcBb except for the last one, ccbb. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C dominant) and Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Pigment red and Brown.\n2. CcBb \u2192 Same as above.\n3. CcBb \u2192 Same.\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain (c recessive) and Checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Plain and Checkered.\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with the previous approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the principles. Another approach is to use Punnett squares for the F2 cross, considering both genes.\n\nSince each gene is independent, the Punnett square would have four quadrants representing the combinations of the two genes. The F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- 25% CC (all C dominant)\n- 25% Cc (some C, some c)\n- 25% cc (all c recessive)\n- 25% BB (all B dominant)\n- 25% Bb (some B, some b)\n- 25% bb (all b recessive)\n\nBut wait, this isn't right because each F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have 25% for each of the six possible combinations: CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, bb. However, considering dominance, the phenotypes would combine accordingly.\n\nWait, no\u2014if each gene is dominant, then:\n\n- For the pigment gene (C/B): Any bird with at least one C allele will have Pigment red.\n- For the body color gene (B/b): Any bird with at least one B allele will have Brown.\n- Only the phenotype that meets both criteria (both C and B present) will have both Pigment red and Brown.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with what I thought before. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display both traits. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Pigment red and Brown.\n- Pigment red (C_) and Checkered (bb) \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered.\n- Plain (cc) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Plain and Brown.\n- Plain (cc) and Checkered (bb) \u2192 Plain and Checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of the two traits. Now, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by determining how many combinations meet the criteria.\n\nBut since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio would follow a 3:1 ratio for each gene, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the combined traits. However, this may vary depending on dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler than that. Since the dominant alleles are expressed, and the recessive are not, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo for each gene, the possible phenotypes are Pigment red (if C is present) and Checkered (if c is present). Similarly for B. Since both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratios would be based on the combination of the two.\n\nThis makes it easier to compute:\n\n- All C and B present: 25%\n- C present, B absent: 25%\n- C absent, B present: 25%\n- C absent, B absent: 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but if each has 25%, then the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But that contradicts the options provided. Looking back, the options don't suggest a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, most options have numbers like 6, 2, etc., suggesting a different calculation.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming independence. Let me reconsider. If the two genes are linked (not independent), the phenotypic ratios could differ significantly, especially if the dominance patterns change. However, the question doesn't mention linkage, so I'll assume they are independent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers only the dominant alleles for each gene, ignoring the recessive ones. Let's see:\n\n- Pigment red is dominant over plain \u2192 any bird with at least one C allele will be Pigment red.\n- Brown is dominant over checkered \u2192 any bird with at least one B allele will be Brown.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene has at least one dominant allele. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 both C and B present.\n2. Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 C present, B absent.\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 C absent, B present.\n4. Plain and Checkered \u2192 C absent, B absent.\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur with certain probabilities. Since each gene is dominant, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C_ and B_): (prob C present) * (prob B present) = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n- Phenotype 2 (C_ and bb): (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n- Phenotype 3 (cc and B_): (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n- Phenotype 4 (cc and bb): (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nWhich again suggests a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is not among the answer choices. This indicates that perhaps the problem is considering the dominance differently or that the user provided an incomplete setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the notation. Let me revisit the problem statement:\n\n- Gene C: pigment color (C is dominant, plain is recessive)\n- Gene B: body color (B is dominant, checkered is recessive)\n\nThe notation is consistent with standard genetics.\n\nNow, the user provided a Punnett square setup, but perhaps I didn't interpret it correctly. Let me check the provided Punnett square:\n\nGametes: (CB) (cb)\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 only CB gametes\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 only cb gametes\n\nCross: (CB)(cb)\n\nResulting F1: CcBb\n\nThen, the F2 cross involves these F1 individuals crossing, but the problem states \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, but the F2 cross isn't clear whether it's F1 x F1 or F2 x F2. However, the initial setup says \"adihybridcross,\" which typically refers to F1 x F1. So perhaps the user intended to ask about an F1 x F1 cross rather than a F2 cross.\n\nIf that's the case, then the F1 is CcBb, and crossing it with itself would yield F2. Let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb) \u2192 F2.\n\nUsing the standard Punnett square for two independent genes, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\nFor each genotype:\n\n- CC (pigment red, regardless of B)\n- Cc (pigment red, regardless of B)\n- cc (plain, regardless of B)\n\nAnd for B:\n\n- BB (brown, regardless of C)\n- Bb (brown, regardless of C)\n- bb (checkered, regardless of C)\n\nNow, combining these:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, counting the occurrences:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 instances\n- Pigment red and Checkered: Cc bb \u2192 1 instance\n- Plain and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain and Checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 instance\n\nTotal: 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7?\n\nWait, that's 7, but that doesn't add up because 3+1+2+1=7, but the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (4x4). Wait, no\u2014each gamete is 1/4, so 16 total. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\nNumber of each genotype:\n\n- CC (1/4)\n- Cc (1/2)\n- cc (1/4)\n\nAnd:\n\n- BB (1/4)\n- Bb (1/2)\n- bb (1/4)\n\nNow, for each genotype, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nNow, for each genotype:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n- BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\nPigment red and Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 instances\nPigment red and Checkered: Cc bb \u2192 1 instance\nPlain and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\nPlain and Checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 instance\n\nTotal: 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7. But wait, that's 7 out of 16. That doesn't make sense. Perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting.\n\nActually, the correct counts should be:\n\nEach of the four possible C genotypes (CC, Cc, cc) and four possible B genotypes (BB, Bb, bb) lead to 16 combinations. Let's map them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n5.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain (if c recessive) and brown\n4. Plain and checkered\n\nWait, but let me clarify: If a bird has the genotype CcBB, then it has pigment red (since C is dominant) and brown (since B is dominant). If it's CcBb, then same as above. For the plain, it must be ccBB or ccBb. And for checkered, it must be ccbb.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 C_B_\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 C_bb\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 ccBB or ccBb\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 ccbb\n\nNow, calculating the probability for each phenotype:\n\nFor phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n- C must be present (so either CB or Cb)\n- B must be present (either BB or Bb)\nSince the genes are independent, the probability is (probability C is present) * (probability B is present).\n\nProbability of C being present = (number of CB and Cb gametes) / total gametes. From F1, each parent contributes CB and cb gametes equally, so F1 can produce 50% CB and 50% cb. Thus, the probability of having C is 50%.\n\nSimilarly, for B: In F1, B is present in half of the gametes (because F1 is CcBB; wait, no, F1 is CcBb, so B is present in 50% of the gametes (since B is dominant). So the probability of B being present is 50%.\n\nThus, the probability for phenotype 1 is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Checkered):\n- C is present (50%) \n- B is absent (i.e., bb) \n\nThe probability of B being absent is 0.5 (since B is dominant, only 50% chance of bb). So 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown):\n- C is absent (cc)\n- B is present (B_)\n \nProbability of C being absent is 0.5.\nProbability of B being present is 0.5.\nSo 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered):\n- C is absent (cc)\n- B is absent (bb)\n\nProbability of C being absent is 0.5.\nProbability of B being absent is 0.5.\nSo 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.\n\nWait, but that would imply all four phenotypes occur with equal frequency, each at 25%, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking back at the options given, none of them seem to match that exactly. Let me re-examine my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual phenotypic ratios aren't perfectly balanced due to dominance. Let me consider the actual genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes without relying solely on probability.\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on whether they have the dominant alleles for both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\nPossible F2 Genotypes:\n1. CC (all C dominant)\n2. Cc (half C, half c)\n3. cc (all c recessive)\n4. BB (all B dominant)\n5. Bb (half B, half b)\n6. bb (all b recessive)\n\nBut wait, these are not the actual combinations because each gene is independent. Actually, the possible combinations are based on the independent assortment of two genes. So the actual F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes' effects. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of each phenotype based on the possible gamete combinations.\n\nLet me try another approach. Each parent produces gametes with specific combinations. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%): All C dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown (if B is dominant) \u2192 Red and Brown?\nWait, actually, Pigment red is dominant over plain, regardless of B. Similarly, Brown is dominant over checkered. So, any bird with at least one dominant allele for each gene will have the phenotype associated with that gene.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things too much. Let me simplify. The F1 is CcBb. When itselfed, the possible F2 phenotypes are determined by the combination of the two genes. Each gene has a 3:1 phenotypic ratio (dominant : recessive), but combined, the phenotypes would have different ratios.\n\nHowever, since the two genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. That is, 3/4 of the cases have the dominant phenotype for both genes, 1/4 have the recessive phenotype for both. But wait, that might not apply directly here because each gene's effect is additive.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's more accurate to say that each gene contributes to the phenotype, and the combination leads to various phenotypic classes. But perhaps a better way is to look at each possible combination.\n\nGiven that each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both genes dominant (C_ B_), leading to Pigment red and Brown.\n2. Pigment dominant (C_) but recessive in B (C_bb).\n3. Plain (cc) but Pigment dominant (B_).\n4. Plain and recessive (ccbb).\n\nCalculating the number of each phenotype:\n\nFor each bird, the number of possible C genotypes is 3 (CC, Cc, cc) and similarly for B. Since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: All C and B dominant \u2192 Pigment red and Brown.\n- 3: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered.\n- 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Plain, Brown.\n- 1: Both recessive \u2192 Plain, Checkered.\n\nWait, but according to the options provided, some have 6, 2, etc., others have higher numbers like 12, 4, etc. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLooking back at the original question, the user listed several answer options, but perhaps I made an error earlier. Let me double-check the initial assumption.\n\nIn the F1 cross, each parent is CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb, as each parent can only provide one type of gamete. Then, F1 selfing would produce the F2 as follows:\n\nThe possible gametes are CB and cb. So F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, but that seems incorrect. Each parent produces gametes CB and cb, so the F2 genotypes should be:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CcBb\n- From CB + cb: CcBb\n- From cb + CB: CcBb\n- From cb + cb: ccbb\n\nSo all four F2 genotypes are CcBb except for the last one, ccbb. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C dominant) and Brown (B dominant) \u2192 Pigment red and Brown.\n2. CcBb \u2192 Same as above.\n3. CcBb \u2192 Same.\n4. ccbb \u2192 Plain (c recessive) and Checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Plain and Checkered.\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with the previous approach. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the principles. Another approach is to use Punnett squares for the F2 cross, considering both genes.\n\nSince each gene is independent, the Punnett square would have four quadrants representing the combinations of the two genes. The F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- 25% CC (all C dominant)\n- 25% Cc (some C, some c)\n- 25% cc (all c recessive)\n- 25% BB (all B dominant)\n- 25% Bb (some B, some b)\n- 25% bb (all b recessive)\n\nBut wait, this isn't right because each F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have 25% for each of the six possible combinations: CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, bb. However, considering dominance, the phenotypes would combine accordingly.\n\nWait, no\u2014if each gene is dominant, then:\n\n- For the pigment gene (C/B): Any bird with at least one C allele will have Pigment red.\n- For the body color gene (B/b): Any bird with at least one B allele will have Brown.\n- Only the phenotype that meets both criteria (both C and B present) will have both Pigment red and Brown.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with what I thought before. Let me clarify:\n\nIf a bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene, it will display both traits. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Pigment red and Brown.\n- Pigment red (C_) and Checkered (bb) \u2192 Pigment red and Checkered.\n- Plain (cc) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Plain and Brown.\n- Plain (cc) and Checkered (bb) \u2192 Plain and Checkered.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypes correspond to the four combinations of the two traits. Now, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated by determining how many combinations meet the criteria.\n\nBut since each gene is independent, the phenotypic ratio would follow a 3:1 ratio for each gene, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the combined traits. However, this may vary depending on dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler than that. Since the dominant alleles are expressed, and the recessive are not, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo for each gene, the possible phenotypes are Pigment red (if C is present) and Checkered (if c is present). Similarly for B. Since both genes are acting independently, the overall phenotypic ratios would be based on the combination of the two.\n\nThis makes it easier to compute:\n\n- All C and B present: 25%\n- C present, B absent: 25%\n- C absent, B present: 25%\n- C absent, B absent: 25%\n\nWait, that adds up to 100%, but if each has 25%, then the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But that contradicts the options provided. Looking back, the options don't suggest a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, most options have numbers like 6, 2, etc., suggesting a different calculation.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming independence. Let me reconsider. If the two genes are linked (not independent), the phenotypic ratios could differ significantly, especially if the dominance patterns change. However, the question doesn't mention linkage, so I'll assume they are independent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem considers only the dominant alleles for each gene, ignoring the recessive ones. Let's see:\n\n- Pigment red is dominant over plain \u2192 any bird with at least one C allele will be Pigment red.\n- Brown is dominant over checkered \u2192 any bird with at least one B allele will be Brown.\n\nThus, the phenotypes are determined by whether each gene has at least one dominant allele. So the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown \u2192 both C and B present.\n2. Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 C present, B absent.\n3. Plain and Brown \u2192 C absent, B present.\n4. Plain and Checkered \u2192 C absent, B absent.\n\nEach of these four phenotypes would occur with certain probabilities. Since each gene is dominant, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype 1 (C_ and B_): (prob C present) * (prob B present) = (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n- Phenotype 2 (C_ and bb): (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n- Phenotype 3 (cc and B_): (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n- Phenotype 4 (cc and bb): (0.5) * (0.5) = 0.25\n\nWhich again suggests a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is not among the answer choices. This indicates that perhaps the problem is considering the dominance differently or that the user provided an incomplete setup.\n\nWait, perhaps I've misunderstood the notation. Let me revisit the problem statement:\n\n- Gene C: pigment color (C is dominant, plain is recessive)\n- Gene B: body color (B is dominant, checkered is recessive)\n\nThe notation is consistent with standard genetics.\n\nNow, the user provided a Punnett square setup, but perhaps I didn't interpret it correctly. Let me check the provided Punnett square:\n\nGametes: (CB) (cb)\n\nParent 1: CC BB \u2192 only CB gametes\nParent 2: cc bb \u2192 only cb gametes\n\nCross: (CB)(cb)\n\nResulting F1: CcBb\n\nThen, the F2 cross involves these F1 individuals crossing, but the problem states \"adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" Wait, but the F2 cross isn't clear whether it's F1 x F1 or F2 x F2. However, the initial setup says \"adihybridcross,\" which typically refers to F1 x F1. So perhaps the user intended to ask about an F1 x F1 cross rather than a F2 cross.\n\nIf that's the case, then the F1 is CcBb, and crossing it with itself would yield F2. Let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb) \u2192 F2.\n\nUsing the standard Punnett square for two independent genes, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, determining the phenotypes:\n\nFor each genotype:\n\n- CC (pigment red, regardless of B)\n- Cc (pigment red, regardless of B)\n- cc (plain, regardless of B)\n\nAnd for B:\n\n- BB (brown, regardless of C)\n- Bb (brown, regardless of C)\n- bb (checkered, regardless of C)\n\nNow, combining these:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, counting the occurrences:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 instances\n- Pigment red and Checkered: Cc bb \u2192 1 instance\n- Plain and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\n- Plain and Checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 instance\n\nTotal: 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7?\n\nWait, that's 7, but that doesn't add up because 3+1+2+1=7, but the total number of F2 individuals is 16 (4x4). Wait, no\u2014each gamete is 1/4, so 16 total. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\nNumber of each genotype:\n\n- CC (1/4)\n- Cc (1/2)\n- cc (1/4)\n\nAnd:\n\n- BB (1/4)\n- Bb (1/2)\n- bb (1/4)\n\nNow, for each genotype, the phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nNow, for each genotype:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- cc \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n- BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nNow, count the number of each phenotype:\n\nPigment red and Brown: CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB \u2192 3 instances\nPigment red and Checkered: Cc bb \u2192 1 instance\nPlain and Brown: cc BB, cc Bb \u2192 2 instances\nPlain and Checkered: cc bb \u2192 1 instance\n\nTotal: 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7. But wait, that's 7 out of 16. That doesn't make sense. Perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting.\n\nActually, the correct counts should be:\n\nEach of the four possible C genotypes (CC, Cc, cc) and four possible B genotypes (BB, Bb, bb) lead to 16 combinations. Let's map them:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered\n\nCounting each phenotype:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown: Cases 1, 2, 4 \u2192 3\n- Pigment red and Checkered: Case 5 \u2192 1\n- Plain and Brown: Cases 7 \u2192 1\n- Plain and Checkered: Case 9 \u2192 1\n\nTotal: 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1:1:1, which simplifies to 3:1 for Pigment red and Brown vs. Plain and Brown/Checkered.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 6:2:6:2 \u2192 3:1:3:1\nOption B: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 same as A\n",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut the actual phenotypic expression depends on dominance. So let's map it:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- If C is present (dominant), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (recessive), the bird is plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n- If B is present (dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (recessive), the bird is checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C (present) and B (present)\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C (present) and b (present)\n3. Pigment plain and brown: c (present) and B (present)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: c (present) and b (present)\n\nNow, each bird will display only one of these four phenotypes based on whether C and B are dominant or not.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category. Since the F2 is a dihybrid cross resulting from a selfing of F1 (which is CcBb), the expected phenotypic ratios can be calculated using the formula for dihybrid crosses.\n\nThe general formula for dihybrid cross (assuming independent genes):\n\nPhenotype ratios = 9:3:3:1\n\nThis applies to two traits where each can be either dominant or recessive. Here, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio would be split into four categories based on the combination of the two traits.\n\nWait, but the F2 population is 9 (for one trait) and 1 (for another), leading to four phenotypic categories. Alternatively, each trait can be considered separately, but since the traits are linked (they're different genes), the combined ratios depend on both traits.\n\nAlternatively, the phenotypic ratio can be thought of as follows:\n\nEach bird will exhibit a specific combination of the two traits. The number of each phenotypic class can be found by considering all possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nLet me calculate the expected numbers for each phenotype in the F2:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16 (since each parent contributes four gametes, 4x4=16)\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n  - Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Phenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n  - Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Phenotype 3: Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n  - Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Phenotype 4: Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n  - Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4 out of 16\n\nWait, that adds up to 16, which checks out. But according to some sources, the dihybrid cross should have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which sums to 16. However, in our case, the phenotypic ratio seems to be evenly distributed among four categories, each having 4 individuals. That doesn't match the typical 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine the possible phenotypes:\n\nEach bird can be categorized as:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown): Red Brown\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered): Red Checkered\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown): Plain Brown\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered): Plain Checkered\n\nIf the two traits are independent, then the probability for each phenotypic combination is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nEach trait is determined independently, so:\n\nProbability for C (Red) = 3/4 (since 1/2 chance of each allele being dominant)\nProbability for B (Brown) = 3/4\n\nThus, the probability for each phenotypic combination would be:\n\n1. C and B: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C and b: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. c and B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. c and b: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nThat makes sense now. So the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four categories above.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation:\n\n- 9 individuals will exhibit the Red Brown phenotype\n- 3 will exhibit Red Checkered\n- 3 will exhibit Plain Brown\n- 1 will exhibit Plain Checkered\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that doesn't align with what I calculated. According to my calculation, the order is:\n\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nBut Option D states: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, that's reversed. Maybe I got the order wrong. Let me make sure about the naming conventions. \"Checkered\" refers to the plain color, and \"plain\" refers to the checkered color. So:\n\n- checkered red: Plain red (because 'red' is dominant for pigment)\n- checkered brown: Plain brown\n- plain red: Red color (since 'red' is dominant)\n- plain brown: Brown color (since 'brown' is dominant)\n\nWait, no. Actually, 'checkered' is the opposite of 'plain'. So:\n\n- 'Checkered' refers to the plain color (the recessive phenotype)\n- 'Plain' refers to the checkered color (the dominant phenotype)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- checkered red: Plain red (so this would be the case when both C and B are recessive: cc bb)\n- checkered brown: Plain brown (when C is dominant, but B is recessive: Cc bb)\n- plain red: Red color (when C is dominant, and B is recessive: cc Bb)\n- plain brown: Brown color (when C is recessive, and B is dominant: cc BB)\n\nSo according to the dihybrid cross, the counts should be:\n\n- checkered red: 1 (cc bb)\n- checkered brown: 3 (Cc bb)\n- plain red: 3 (cc Bb)\n- plain brown: 9 (cc BB)\n\nWhich matches option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the ratio was 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 plain brown, 3 plain red, 3 checkered red, and 1 checkered brown. Which would mean:\n\n- checkered red: 1\n- checkered brown: 3\n- plain red: 3\n- plain brown: 9\n\nYes, that matches option G.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user provided multiple options, including E and others. Let me double-check the dihybrid cross calculations.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the Punnett square method. Let's construct the Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nThe possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each occurring at a 25% rate.\n\nWhen these gametes combine:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CB + cb = Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CB + cB = Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 plain red\n- cb + cB = cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 plain red\n- cB + cB = cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cB + cb = cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cB + cb = cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me list them properly:\n\nAll possible combinations:\n\n1. CB + CB = CC BB\n2. CB + cb = Cc BB\n3. CB + cB = Cc BB\n4. CB + cb = Cc Bb\n5. cb + cb = cc bb\n6. cb + cB = cc Bb\n7. cb + cb = cc bb\n8. cB + cB = cc BB\n9. cB + cb = cc Bb\n10. cB + cb = cc Bb\n\nNow, categorizing these:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (phenotype: checkered red)\n2. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red (same as above)\n3. Cc BB \u2192 same\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n5. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n6. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n7. cc bb \u2192 same as above\n8. cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc Bb \u2192 same as above\n10. cc Bb \u2192 same as above\n\nCounting the occurrences:\n\n- checkered red: 1 (1st) + 2nd + 3rd \u2192 3 times? Wait, no, each gamete combination leads to one bird. So:\n\nFrom 1-10:\n\n- checkered red appears in 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2192 no, wait, 1 is CC BB, which is checkered red. Then CB + cb is Cc Bb, which is checkered brown. Similarly, the rest:\n\nWait, perhaps better to count the phenotypes directly without getting lost in the gametes.\n\nIn the Punnett square:\n\n- The phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B.\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B present: 1 (from CB + CB, CB + cb, etc.)\n2. Only C present: 3 (from CB + cb, cb + cb, etc.)\n3. Only B present: 3 (from cB + cb, cB + cb, etc.)\n4. Neither present: 1 (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Let me recast:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 checkered red (cc bb)\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown (Cc bb)\nPhenotype 3: B present, C absent \u2192 plain brown (cc BB)\nPhenotype 4: Neither present \u2192 plain red (cc bb)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because:\n\n- C present (C is dominant) and B present (B is dominant) \u2192 checkered red (cc bb)\n- C present and B absent \u2192 checkered brown (Cc bb)\n- B present and C absent \u2192 plain brown (cc BB)\n- Neither present \u2192 plain red (cc bb)\n\nNow, counting each:\n\n- Both C and B: 1 (from CB + CB, CB + cb, etc.) \u2192 1 bird\n- C and not B: 3 (from CB + cb, cb + cb, cB + cb) \u2192 3 birds\n- B and not C: 3 (from cB + cb, cb + cB, cc BB + cb) \u2192 3 birds\n- Neither: 1 (from cb + cb) \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, but that's 8 birds accounted for, but we have 16. Hmm, maybe I missed something.\n\nActually, each of the four phenotypes should account for half of the F2 (since each gene has two possibilities, and the traits are independent).\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nFrom the 10 possible gamete combinations:\n\n- 1 bird: both C and B present \u2192 checkered red\n- 3 birds: C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown\n- 3 birds: B present, C absent \u2192 plain brown\n- 1 bird: neither present \u2192 plain red\n\nBut that sums to 1+3+3+1=8, missing 8 birds. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, each F2 individual is formed by a gamete from each parent. Since each parent contributes 4 gametes, there are 4\u00d74=16 possible combinations. Each combination results in one bird.\n\nNow, the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 checkered red (cc bb)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown (Cc bb)\n3. B present, C absent \u2192 plain brown (cc BB)\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain red (cc bb)\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B present: How many?\n\nLooking at the Punnett square, the only way to get both C and B is when each parent contributes a C and a B. That happens in 1 way: CB from each parent. Wait, no. Each parent can contribute CB or cb. So for both parents to contribute CB, that's 1/4 chance for each, so 1/16 chance for CB + CB. Similarly, for CB + cb, that's 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 for each of the four combinations. Wait, perhaps a table would help.\n\nLet me make a grid of the F1 gametes:\n\nParent 1: Gametes are CB, cb\nParent 2: Gametes are CB, cb\n\nCombination:\n\n- CB + CB: both C and B \u2192 checkered red\n- CB + cb: C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown\n- cb + CB: C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown\n- cb + cb: neither \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, that's only four birds, but we know there are 16. Oh, because each F1 gamete is present in equal frequency, so the Punnett square would have 4 x 4 = 16 birds, with each combination occurring once. So:\n\nFrom the four possible combinations, each results in one bird, so:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 checkered red (1 bird)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 checkered brown (1 bird)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 checkered brown (1 bird)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 plain red (1 bird)\n\nBut that's only 4 birds. To reach 16, each combination must occur four times. So the actual counts would be:\n\n- checkered red: 4 birds\n- checkered brown: 8 birds\n- plain brown: 8 birds\n- plain red: 4 birds\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4+8+8+4=24, which exceeds the total of 16. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nLet me approach it differently. The Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 is 4x4, giving 16 birds. Each cell represents a possible combination of gametes, leading to a bird. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThe phenotypes correspond to the presence of dominant C and B alleles. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the number of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the number of ways each trait can be expressed.\n\n- Both C and B dominant (C and B present): This occurs in 1/4 of the cases (only when each parent contributes a C and a B). Since each parent can contribute CB or cb, the only way to have both C and B is to have CB from both parents. So 1 case.\n- Only C dominant (C present, B absent): This occurs when one parent contributes CB and the other contributes cb. There are 2 such combinations (CB from one parent and cb from the other, and vice versa).\n- Only B dominant (B present, C absent): Similar to above, occurs in 2 cases.\n- Neither dominant: Occurs when both parents contribute cb, resulting in cc bb.\n\nSince each of the 16 birds is equally likely, the counts are:\n\n- Both C and B: 4 (since 1/4 of 16)\n- C dominant (and B absent): 8 (since 2/4 of 16)\n- B dominant (and C absent): 8 (since 2/4 of 16)\n- Neither: 4 (since 1/4 of 16)\n\nWait, but that sums to 4+8+8+4=24, which is impossible. There must be an error in this reasoning.\n\nAh! I realize the mistake now. Each of the 16 birds is equally represented in the Punnett square, but the way the phenotypes are counted isn't simply additive because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits simultaneously.\n\nInstead, the correct approach is to recognize that the dihybrid cross follows the 9:3:3:1 ratio, regardless of the order of the traits. Therefore, in the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant (checkered red): 9\n2. C dominant, B absent (checkered brown): 3\n3. B dominant, C absent (plain brown): 3\n4. Neither dominant (plain red): 1\n\nHowever, the question lists the options as:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nGiven the correct dihybrid",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut the actual phenotypic expression depends on dominance. So let's map it:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- If C is present (dominant), the bird is red.\n- If c is present (recessive), the bird is plain.\n\nFor body color (B):\n- If B is present (dominant), the bird is brown.\n- If b is present (recessive), the bird is checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: C (present) and B (present)\n2. Pigment red and checkered: C (present) and b (present)\n3. Pigment plain and brown: c (present) and B (present)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: c (present) and b (present)\n\nNow, each bird will display only one of these four phenotypes based on whether C and B are dominant or not.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category. Since the F2 is a dihybrid cross resulting from a selfing of F1 (which is CcBb), the expected phenotypic ratios can be calculated using the formula for dihybrid crosses.\n\nThe general formula for dihybrid cross (assuming independent genes):\n\nPhenotype ratios = 9:3:3:1\n\nThis applies to two traits where each can be either dominant or recessive. Here, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio would be split into four categories based on the combination of the two traits.\n\nWait, but the F2 population is 9 (for one trait) and 1 (for another), leading to four phenotypic categories. Alternatively, each trait can be considered separately, but since the traits are linked (they're different genes), the combined ratios depend on both traits.\n\nAlternatively, the phenotypic ratio can be thought of as follows:\n\nEach bird will exhibit a specific combination of the two traits. The number of each phenotypic class can be found by considering all possible combinations of the two traits.\n\nLet me calculate the expected numbers for each phenotype in the F2:\n\nTotal F2 individuals = 16 (since each parent contributes four gametes, 4x4=16)\n\n- Phenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n  - Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Phenotype 2: Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n  - Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Phenotype 3: Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n  - Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4 out of 16\n- Phenotype 4: Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n  - Probability = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 4 out of 16\n\nWait, that adds up to 16, which checks out. But according to some sources, the dihybrid cross should have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, which sums to 16. However, in our case, the phenotypic ratio seems to be evenly distributed among four categories, each having 4 individuals. That doesn't match the typical 9:3:3:1 ratio. Perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me re-examine the possible phenotypes:\n\nEach bird can be categorized as:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown): Red Brown\n2. C (Red) and b (Checkered): Red Checkered\n3. c (Plain) and B (Brown): Plain Brown\n4. c (Plain) and b (Checkered): Plain Checkered\n\nIf the two traits are independent, then the probability for each phenotypic combination is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nEach trait is determined independently, so:\n\nProbability for C (Red) = 3/4 (since 1/2 chance of each allele being dominant)\nProbability for B (Brown) = 3/4\n\nThus, the probability for each phenotypic combination would be:\n\n1. C and B: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C and b: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. c and B: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. c and b: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16 parts, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nThat makes sense now. So the phenotypic distribution is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four categories above.\n\nTherefore, in the F2 generation:\n\n- 9 individuals will exhibit the Red Brown phenotype\n- 3 will exhibit Red Checkered\n- 3 will exhibit Plain Brown\n- 1 will exhibit Plain Checkered\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nWait, hold on\u2014that doesn't align with what I calculated. According to my calculation, the order is:\n\n- Red Brown: 9\n- Red Checkered: 3\n- Plain Brown: 3\n- Plain Checkered: 1\n\nBut Option D states: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nHmm, that's reversed. Maybe I got the order wrong. Let me make sure about the naming conventions. \"Checkered\" refers to the plain color, and \"plain\" refers to the checkered color. So:\n\n- checkered red: Plain red (because 'red' is dominant for pigment)\n- checkered brown: Plain brown\n- plain red: Red color (since 'red' is dominant)\n- plain brown: Brown color (since 'brown' is dominant)\n\nWait, no. Actually, 'checkered' is the opposite of 'plain'. So:\n\n- 'Checkered' refers to the plain color (the recessive phenotype)\n- 'Plain' refers to the checkered color (the dominant phenotype)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- checkered red: Plain red (so this would be the case when both C and B are recessive: cc bb)\n- checkered brown: Plain brown (when C is dominant, but B is recessive: Cc bb)\n- plain red: Red color (when C is dominant, and B is recessive: cc Bb)\n- plain brown: Brown color (when C is recessive, and B is dominant: cc BB)\n\nSo according to the dihybrid cross, the counts should be:\n\n- checkered red: 1 (cc bb)\n- checkered brown: 3 (Cc bb)\n- plain red: 3 (cc Bb)\n- plain brown: 9 (cc BB)\n\nWhich matches option G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 9\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the ratio was 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 9 plain brown, 3 plain red, 3 checkered red, and 1 checkered brown. Which would mean:\n\n- checkered red: 1\n- checkered brown: 3\n- plain red: 3\n- plain brown: 9\n\nYes, that matches option G.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user provided multiple options, including E and others. Let me double-check the dihybrid cross calculations.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to use the Punnett square method. Let's construct the Punnett square for CcBb \u00d7 CcBb.\n\nThe possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb, each occurring at a 25% rate.\n\nWhen these gametes combine:\n\n- CB + CB = CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CB + cb = Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CB + cB = Cc BB \u2192 checkered red\n- CB + cb = Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n- cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 plain red\n- cb + cB = cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cb + cb = cc bb \u2192 plain red\n- cB + cB = cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n- cB + cb = cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n- cB + cb = cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me list them properly:\n\nAll possible combinations:\n\n1. CB + CB = CC BB\n2. CB + cb = Cc BB\n3. CB + cB = Cc BB\n4. CB + cb = Cc Bb\n5. cb + cb = cc bb\n6. cb + cB = cc Bb\n7. cb + cb = cc bb\n8. cB + cB = cc BB\n9. cB + cb = cc Bb\n10. cB + cb = cc Bb\n\nNow, categorizing these:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 checkered red (phenotype: checkered red)\n2. Cc BB \u2192 checkered red (same as above)\n3. Cc BB \u2192 same\n4. Cc Bb \u2192 checkered brown\n5. cc bb \u2192 plain red\n6. cc Bb \u2192 plain brown\n7. cc bb \u2192 same as above\n8. cc BB \u2192 plain brown\n9. cc Bb \u2192 same as above\n10. cc Bb \u2192 same as above\n\nCounting the occurrences:\n\n- checkered red: 1 (1st) + 2nd + 3rd \u2192 3 times? Wait, no, each gamete combination leads to one bird. So:\n\nFrom 1-10:\n\n- checkered red appears in 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2192 no, wait, 1 is CC BB, which is checkered red. Then CB + cb is Cc Bb, which is checkered brown. Similarly, the rest:\n\nWait, perhaps better to count the phenotypes directly without getting lost in the gametes.\n\nIn the Punnett square:\n\n- The phenotypes are determined by the presence of C and B.\n\nNumber of each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B present: 1 (from CB + CB, CB + cb, etc.)\n2. Only C present: 3 (from CB + cb, cb + cb, etc.)\n3. Only B present: 3 (from cB + cb, cB + cb, etc.)\n4. Neither present: 1 (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Let me recast:\n\nPhenotype 1: Both C and B present \u2192 checkered red (cc bb)\nPhenotype 2: C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown (Cc bb)\nPhenotype 3: B present, C absent \u2192 plain brown (cc BB)\nPhenotype 4: Neither present \u2192 plain red (cc bb)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because:\n\n- C present (C is dominant) and B present (B is dominant) \u2192 checkered red (cc bb)\n- C present and B absent \u2192 checkered brown (Cc bb)\n- B present and C absent \u2192 plain brown (cc BB)\n- Neither present \u2192 plain red (cc bb)\n\nNow, counting each:\n\n- Both C and B: 1 (from CB + CB, CB + cb, etc.) \u2192 1 bird\n- C and not B: 3 (from CB + cb, cb + cb, cB + cb) \u2192 3 birds\n- B and not C: 3 (from cB + cb, cb + cB, cc BB + cb) \u2192 3 birds\n- Neither: 1 (from cb + cb) \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, but that's 8 birds accounted for, but we have 16. Hmm, maybe I missed something.\n\nActually, each of the four phenotypes should account for half of the F2 (since each gene has two possibilities, and the traits are independent).\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nFrom the 10 possible gamete combinations:\n\n- 1 bird: both C and B present \u2192 checkered red\n- 3 birds: C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown\n- 3 birds: B present, C absent \u2192 plain brown\n- 1 bird: neither present \u2192 plain red\n\nBut that sums to 1+3+3+1=8, missing 8 birds. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, each F2 individual is formed by a gamete from each parent. Since each parent contributes 4 gametes, there are 4\u00d74=16 possible combinations. Each combination results in one bird.\n\nNow, the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B present \u2192 checkered red (cc bb)\n2. C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown (Cc bb)\n3. B present, C absent \u2192 plain brown (cc BB)\n4. Neither present \u2192 plain red (cc bb)\n\nNow, the number of each phenotype:\n\n1. Both C and B present: How many?\n\nLooking at the Punnett square, the only way to get both C and B is when each parent contributes a C and a B. That happens in 1 way: CB from each parent. Wait, no. Each parent can contribute CB or cb. So for both parents to contribute CB, that's 1/4 chance for each, so 1/16 chance for CB + CB. Similarly, for CB + cb, that's 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16 for each of the four combinations. Wait, perhaps a table would help.\n\nLet me make a grid of the F1 gametes:\n\nParent 1: Gametes are CB, cb\nParent 2: Gametes are CB, cb\n\nCombination:\n\n- CB + CB: both C and B \u2192 checkered red\n- CB + cb: C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown\n- cb + CB: C present, B absent \u2192 checkered brown\n- cb + cb: neither \u2192 plain red\n\nWait, that's only four birds, but we know there are 16. Oh, because each F1 gamete is present in equal frequency, so the Punnett square would have 4 x 4 = 16 birds, with each combination occurring once. So:\n\nFrom the four possible combinations, each results in one bird, so:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 checkered red (1 bird)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 checkered brown (1 bird)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 checkered brown (1 bird)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 plain red (1 bird)\n\nBut that's only 4 birds. To reach 16, each combination must occur four times. So the actual counts would be:\n\n- checkered red: 4 birds\n- checkered brown: 8 birds\n- plain brown: 8 birds\n- plain red: 4 birds\n\nWait, that can't be right because 4+8+8+4=24, which exceeds the total of 16. Clearly, I'm making a mistake here.\n\nLet me approach it differently. The Punnett square for F1 \u00d7 F1 is 4x4, giving 16 birds. Each cell represents a possible combination of gametes, leading to a bird. The phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nThe phenotypes correspond to the presence of dominant C and B alleles. Since each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles, the number of each phenotype can be calculated by considering the number of ways each trait can be expressed.\n\n- Both C and B dominant (C and B present): This occurs in 1/4 of the cases (only when each parent contributes a C and a B). Since each parent can contribute CB or cb, the only way to have both C and B is to have CB from both parents. So 1 case.\n- Only C dominant (C present, B absent): This occurs when one parent contributes CB and the other contributes cb. There are 2 such combinations (CB from one parent and cb from the other, and vice versa).\n- Only B dominant (B present, C absent): Similar to above, occurs in 2 cases.\n- Neither dominant: Occurs when both parents contribute cb, resulting in cc bb.\n\nSince each of the 16 birds is equally likely, the counts are:\n\n- Both C and B: 4 (since 1/4 of 16)\n- C dominant (and B absent): 8 (since 2/4 of 16)\n- B dominant (and C absent): 8 (since 2/4 of 16)\n- Neither: 4 (since 1/4 of 16)\n\nWait, but that sums to 4+8+8+4=24, which is impossible. There must be an error in this reasoning.\n\nAh! I realize the mistake now. Each of the 16 birds is equally represented in the Punnett square, but the way the phenotypes are counted isn't simply additive because each bird's phenotype is determined by both traits simultaneously.\n\nInstead, the correct approach is to recognize that the dihybrid cross follows the 9:3:3:1 ratio, regardless of the order of the traits. Therefore, in the F2 generation, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the four phenotypes:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant (checkered red): 9\n2. C dominant, B absent (checkered brown): 3\n3. B dominant, C absent (plain brown): 3\n4. Neither dominant (plain red): 1\n\nHowever, the question lists the options as:\n\nA. checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nGiven the correct dihybrid",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if both recessive)\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match this exact breakdown. Instead, the options list checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Hmm, perhaps the way the genes interact is different. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that checkered is a dominant phenotype regardless of pigment color. Wait, perhaps the problem defines \"checkered\" as a separate phenotype even if pigment is absent. That might complicate things. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is controlled by the recessive allele c.\n- Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B.\n- Brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\n\nSo, the checkered pattern is dependent on gene C. If either C is present or not, it could be checkered. Similarly, the pigment color depends on gene B. If B is present, it's brown; if not, it's plain. So the phenotype combines these two traits. Therefore, each bird has a combination of these traits, leading to four possible phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Checkered red: B present and C present\n2. Checkered brown: B present and C absent\n3. Plain red: B absent and C present\n4. Plain brown: B absent and C absent\n\nNow, we need to determine how often each of these phenotypes appears in the F2 generation. To do this, we'll use the standard approach of determining the probability of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's consider the F2 generation. The F1 from the dihybrid cross (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) will produce gametes with the following distribution:\n\n- For gene C: 25% C (dominant, red), 25% c (recessive, plain)\n- For gene B: 25% B (dominant, brown), 25% b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, each combination of C and B alleles in the F1 will occur with a probability of (25% for C) * (25% for B) = 6.25% for each specific genotype.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n1. **Checkered red (B present, C present)**:\n   - Probability of C present: 25%\n   - Probability of B present: 25%\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n2. **Checkered brown (B present, C absent)**:\n   - Probability of C absent: 75%\n   - Probability of B present: 25%\n   - Combined probability: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n\n3. **Plain red (B absent, C present)**:\n   - Probability of C present: 25%\n   - Probability of B absent: 75%\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n4. **Plain brown (B absent, C absent)**:\n   - Probability of C absent: 75%\n   - Probability of B absent: 75%\n   - Combined probability: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n\nWait, but this doesn't add up to 100% because some phenotypes combine. Let me double-check. Actually, each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of the two traits, so the sum should be 100%.\n\nLooking at the calculations:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75%\n- Plain red: 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 56.25%\n\nAdding them together: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio. However, the options provided don't include decimal percentages. They likely want the ratio expressed in whole numbers relative to each other. So, let's convert the probabilities into whole number ratios:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25 \u2192 Multiply by 16 to get 100 (since 6.25*16=100)\n- Checkered brown: 18.75 \u2192 Multiply by 16 to get 300\n- Plain red: 18.75 \u2192 Multiply by 16 to get 300\n- Plain brown: 56.25 \u2192 Multiply by 16 to get 900\n\nWait, that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps scaling by 4 to make the math easier:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25/4 = 1.5625 \u2192 Not helpful. Maybe better to express as fractions.\n\nAlternatively, recognize that 6.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 56.25 simplifies to 1 : 3 : 3 : 16. Because:\n\nDivide each by 6.25:\n\n- 6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the previous calculation. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach. Instead of calculating probabilities, perhaps look at the actual genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nEach F2 bird can be represented by their genotype for the two genes:\n\n- For C: CC (red), Cc (red), cc (plain)\n- For B: BB (brown), Bb (brown), bb (checkered)\n\nSo the possible genotypic combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting with my earlier approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count the number of each phenotype directly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, but since we're dealing with phenotypes, each phenotype corresponds to certain genotypes. Let me map each phenotype to its corresponding genotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered red (phenotype)**: Requires at least one dominant C (so CC or Cc) and at least one dominant B (BB or Bb). So the genotypes are CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb. These correspond to 4 out of 9 cases.\n   \n2. **Checkered brown (phenotype)**: Requires C dominant (CC or Cc) and B recessive (bb). Genotypes: CC bb, Cc bb. These correspond to 2 out of 9 cases.\n\n3. **Plain red (phenotype)**: Requires C recessive (cc) and B dominant (BB or Bb). Genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb. These correspond to 2 out of 9 cases.\n\n4. **Plain brown (phenotype)**: Requires C recessive (cc) and B recessive (bb). Genotype: cc bb. This corresponds to 1 out of 9 cases.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9\n- Checkered brown: 2/9\n- Plain red: 2/9\n- Plain brown: 1/9\n\nTo express this as a ratio, we can multiply numerator and denominator by 9 to eliminate denominators:\n\n4 : 2 : 2 : 1\n\nWhich simplifies to 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our 4:2:2:1 ratio.\n\nOption J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't match.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's a zero plain brown, which isn't accurate.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Again, not matching.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4. No.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1. That matches our simplified ratio after multiplying by 1:1:1:1/4. Wait, but 9:3:3:1 divided by 4 gives 9/4 : 3/4 : 3/4 : 1/4, which isn't exactly what we have. Our ratio is 4:2:2:1, which is equivalent to 12:6:6:3 when scaled by 3. But none of the options seem to reflect that exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes to genotypes. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype(s)\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | Any genotype where C is present and B is present (i.e., CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\nCheckered brown | Any genotype where C is present and B is absent (CC bb, Cc bb)\nPlain red | Any genotype where C is absent and B is present (cc BB, cc Bb)\nPlain brown | Only cc bb\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1=9\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. None of the options exactly match this except possibly option G, which is 12:2:2:0, but that's not correct because we have 1 plain brown.\n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which is more than 9, so it's incorrect.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's 16 again.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which is less than 9? Wait, no, 2+6+3+1=12, which exceeds 9, so that's wrong.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't account for all phenotypes.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match the 4:2:2:1 ratio. But option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16, so that's too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo and meant F1 instead of F2. But according to the user's instruction, he wants the answer for F2. So perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the phenotypic ratio. Let me recalculate the probabilities.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of B and C. The F2 generation has a 9:3:3:1 dihybrid ratio. Each phenotype corresponds to a subset:\n\n- Checkered red: B present and C present \u2192 (2/3)(3/4) = 6/12\n- Checkered brown: B present and C absent \u2192 (2/3)(1/4) = 2/12\n- Plain red: B absent and C present \u2192 (1/3)(3/4) = 3/12\n- Plain brown: B absent and C absent \u2192 (1/3)(1/4) = 1/12\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Calculating the probabilities as fractions of the total:\n\n- Checkered red (B and C present): (2/3)*(3/4) = 6/12\n- Checkered brown (B present, C absent): (2/3)*(1/4) = 2/12\n- Plain red (B absent, C present): (1/3)*(3/4) = 3/12\n- Plain brown (B absent, C absent): (1/3)*(1/4) = 1/12\n\nThis totals 6/12 + 2/12 + 3/12 + 1/12 = 12/12, which is correct.\n\nExpressed as a ratio: 6:2:3:1\n\nBut the options don't have this. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended F1 instead of F2, but according to the instructions, the question is about F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds, not the probability ratios. In that case, each phenotype would correspond to a certain number of birds based on the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nIf we assume a population size that makes the counts integers, say 12 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 6\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThat totals 12, which fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But none of the options reflect this exactly.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which is too much.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if both recessive)\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match this exact breakdown. Instead, the options list checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown. Hmm, perhaps the way the genes interact is different. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that checkered is a dominant phenotype regardless of pigment color. Wait, perhaps the problem defines \"checkered\" as a separate phenotype even if pigment is absent. That might complicate things. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Checkered pattern is controlled by a dominant gene C.\n- Plain color is controlled by the recessive allele c.\n- Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B.\n- Brown color is controlled by the recessive allele b.\n\nSo, the checkered pattern is dependent on gene C. If either C is present or not, it could be checkered. Similarly, the pigment color depends on gene B. If B is present, it's brown; if not, it's plain. So the phenotype combines these two traits. Therefore, each bird has a combination of these traits, leading to four possible phenotypic classes:\n\n1. Checkered red: B present and C present\n2. Checkered brown: B present and C absent\n3. Plain red: B absent and C present\n4. Plain brown: B absent and C absent\n\nNow, we need to determine how often each of these phenotypes appears in the F2 generation. To do this, we'll use the standard approach of determining the probability of each genotype leading to each phenotype.\n\nFirst, let's consider the F2 generation. The F1 from the dihybrid cross (CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) will produce gametes with the following distribution:\n\n- For gene C: 25% C (dominant, red), 25% c (recessive, plain)\n- For gene B: 25% B (dominant, brown), 25% b (recessive, checkered)\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, each combination of C and B alleles in the F1 will occur with a probability of (25% for C) * (25% for B) = 6.25% for each specific genotype.\n\nNow, let's calculate the frequency of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\n1. **Checkered red (B present, C present)**:\n   - Probability of C present: 25%\n   - Probability of B present: 25%\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\n2. **Checkered brown (B present, C absent)**:\n   - Probability of C absent: 75%\n   - Probability of B present: 25%\n   - Combined probability: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n\n3. **Plain red (B absent, C present)**:\n   - Probability of C present: 25%\n   - Probability of B absent: 75%\n   - Combined probability: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n\n4. **Plain brown (B absent, C absent)**:\n   - Probability of C absent: 75%\n   - Probability of B absent: 75%\n   - Combined probability: 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n\nWait, but this doesn't add up to 100% because some phenotypes combine. Let me double-check. Actually, each phenotype corresponds to a unique combination of the two traits, so the sum should be 100%.\n\nLooking at the calculations:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25%\n- Checkered brown: 18.75%\n- Plain red: 18.75%\n- Plain brown: 56.25%\n\nAdding them together: 6.25 + 18.75 + 18.75 + 56.25 = 100%, which checks out.\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio. However, the options provided don't include decimal percentages. They likely want the ratio expressed in whole numbers relative to each other. So, let's convert the probabilities into whole number ratios:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25 \u2192 Multiply by 16 to get 100 (since 6.25*16=100)\n- Checkered brown: 18.75 \u2192 Multiply by 16 to get 300\n- Plain red: 18.75 \u2192 Multiply by 16 to get 300\n- Plain brown: 56.25 \u2192 Multiply by 16 to get 900\n\nWait, that seems off. Alternatively, perhaps scaling by 4 to make the math easier:\n\n- Checkered red: 6.25/4 = 1.5625 \u2192 Not helpful. Maybe better to express as fractions.\n\nAlternatively, recognize that 6.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 56.25 simplifies to 1 : 3 : 3 : 16. Because:\n\nDivide each by 6.25:\n\n- 6.25 / 6.25 = 1\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 18.75 / 6.25 = 3\n- 56.25 / 6.25 = 9\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the previous calculation. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try another approach. Instead of calculating probabilities, perhaps look at the actual genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nEach F2 bird can be represented by their genotype for the two genes:\n\n- For C: CC (red), Cc (red), cc (plain)\n- For B: BB (brown), Bb (brown), bb (checkered)\n\nSo the possible genotypic combinations are:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Checkered red\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n3. CC bb \u2192 Plain brown\n4. Cc BB \u2192 Checkered red\n5. Cc Bb \u2192 Checkered brown\n6. Cc bb \u2192 Plain brown\n7. cc BB \u2192 Plain red\n8. cc Bb \u2192 Plain brown\n9. cc bb \u2192 Checkered red\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting with my earlier approach. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count the number of each phenotype directly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1, but since we're dealing with phenotypes, each phenotype corresponds to certain genotypes. Let me map each phenotype to its corresponding genotypes:\n\n1. **Checkered red (phenotype)**: Requires at least one dominant C (so CC or Cc) and at least one dominant B (BB or Bb). So the genotypes are CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb. These correspond to 4 out of 9 cases.\n   \n2. **Checkered brown (phenotype)**: Requires C dominant (CC or Cc) and B recessive (bb). Genotypes: CC bb, Cc bb. These correspond to 2 out of 9 cases.\n\n3. **Plain red (phenotype)**: Requires C recessive (cc) and B dominant (BB or Bb). Genotypes: cc BB, cc Bb. These correspond to 2 out of 9 cases.\n\n4. **Plain brown (phenotype)**: Requires C recessive (cc) and B recessive (bb). Genotype: cc bb. This corresponds to 1 out of 9 cases.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4/9\n- Checkered brown: 2/9\n- Plain red: 2/9\n- Plain brown: 1/9\n\nTo express this as a ratio, we can multiply numerator and denominator by 9 to eliminate denominators:\n\n4 : 2 : 2 : 1\n\nWhich simplifies to 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options provided, option D says: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't match our 4:2:2:1 ratio.\n\nOption J says: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That also doesn't match.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That's a zero plain brown, which isn't accurate.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Again, not matching.\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4. No.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1. That matches our simplified ratio after multiplying by 1:1:1:1/4. Wait, but 9:3:3:1 divided by 4 gives 9/4 : 3/4 : 3/4 : 1/4, which isn't exactly what we have. Our ratio is 4:2:2:1, which is equivalent to 12:6:6:3 when scaled by 3. But none of the options seem to reflect that exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the phenotypes to genotypes. Let me recount:\n\nPhenotype | Genotype(s)\n--- | ---\nCheckered red | Any genotype where C is present and B is present (i.e., CC BB, CC Bb, Cc BB, Cc Bb)\nCheckered brown | Any genotype where C is present and B is absent (CC bb, Cc bb)\nPlain red | Any genotype where C is absent and B is present (cc BB, cc Bb)\nPlain brown | Only cc bb\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- Checkered red: 4\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 2\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nTotal: 4+2+2+1=9\n\nThus, the ratio is 4:2:2:1. None of the options exactly match this except possibly option G, which is 12:2:2:0, but that's not correct because we have 1 plain brown.\n\nLooking again at the options:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which is more than 9, so it's incorrect.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That's 16 again.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, which is less than 9? Wait, no, 2+6+3+1=12, which exceeds 9, so that's wrong.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't account for all phenotypes.\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Sum is 16.\n\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Sum is 16.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match the 4:2:2:1 ratio. But option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16, so that's too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the problem. Let me read it again.\n\nThe problem says: \"For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo and meant F1 instead of F2. But according to the user's instruction, he wants the answer for F2. So perhaps I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the phenotypic ratio. Let me recalculate the probabilities.\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of B and C. The F2 generation has a 9:3:3:1 dihybrid ratio. Each phenotype corresponds to a subset:\n\n- Checkered red: B present and C present \u2192 (2/3)(3/4) = 6/12\n- Checkered brown: B present and C absent \u2192 (2/3)(1/4) = 2/12\n- Plain red: B absent and C present \u2192 (1/3)(3/4) = 3/12\n- Plain brown: B absent and C absent \u2192 (1/3)(1/4) = 1/12\n\nWait, that's a different approach. Calculating the probabilities as fractions of the total:\n\n- Checkered red (B and C present): (2/3)*(3/4) = 6/12\n- Checkered brown (B present, C absent): (2/3)*(1/4) = 2/12\n- Plain red (B absent, C present): (1/3)*(3/4) = 3/12\n- Plain brown (B absent, C absent): (1/3)*(1/4) = 1/12\n\nThis totals 6/12 + 2/12 + 3/12 + 1/12 = 12/12, which is correct.\n\nExpressed as a ratio: 6:2:3:1\n\nBut the options don't have this. Option G is 12:2:2:0, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended F1 instead of F2, but according to the instructions, the question is about F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of the number of birds, not the probability ratios. In that case, each phenotype would correspond to a certain number of birds based on the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nIf we assume a population size that makes the counts integers, say 12 birds:\n\n- Checkered red: 6\n- Checkered brown: 2\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nThat totals 12, which fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But none of the options reflect this exactly.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which is too much. Option D is 1,3,9,3\u219216 again.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended F1, but the question is about F2. Regardless, none of the options seem to match the 4:2:2:1 ratio. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which is a different ratio, and option J is 2,6,3,1\u219212, which still doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best choice among the options is option E, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps the user asked for the phenotypic ratio without normalization, so 4:2:2:1. Looking at the options again, option G is 12:2:2:0, which is 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, 0 plain brown. That doesn't fit because we have 4 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 1 plain brown.\n\nNone of the options perfectly match 4:2:2:1. However, option D is 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16, but that's inconsistent. Option J is 2,6,3,1\u219212, which is close but not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended F1 instead of F2, but the question clearly specifies F2. Given that, and considering the options, option E has the highest number of checkered red, which might be incorrect.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Based on the dihybrid cross and the given options, I think the correct phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which doesn't match any option exactly. However, option D is 1,3,9,3, which sums to 16, but perhaps the user rounded somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the user expects the ratio without normalization, making it 4:2:2:1, which is not among the options. \n\nWait, looking again, option G is 12:2:2:0, which seems like a trihybrid ratio, but that's not applicable here.\n\nPerhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, I might have made an error in interpreting the problem. Let me try another approach. If the dihybrid cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a homozygous plain brown (cc bb), then the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the expected F2 genotypes are 25% CC BB, 25% CC Bb, 25% cc BB, 25% cc Bb. The phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC BB: Checkered red\n- CC Bb: Checkered brown\n- cc BB: Plain red\n- cc Bb: Plain brown\n\nThus, in F2, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, the options don't reflect this. The closest is option D: 1,3,9,3, which adds to 16. But that suggests a trihybrid situation, which doesn't apply here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is confusing the F2 with F1, and the correct ratio is 1:1:1:1, but that's not listed.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the best answer among the options is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. But that's 16 birds, which doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended F1, but the question is about F2. Without further clarification, I'll go with option E, but I'm unsure.\n\nWait, perhaps I made",

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the dominant C controls pigment color, and the recessive c controls plain. The dominant B controls brown, and the recessive b controls checkered. So the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Pigmented plain and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Pigmented plain and checkered (cc_b_)\n\nNow, for the F2 generation, which comes from F1 selfing (since F1 is CcBb), the F2 would have the following probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: C (dominant) = 75%, c (recessive) = 25%\nFor the B locus: B (dominant) = 75%, b (recessive) = 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratios are calculated by multiplying the probabilities. But wait, each gene contributes to the phenotype independently. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is dominant and/or B is dominant.\n\nSo the number of phenotypic categories is 2 (for C) x 2 (for B) = 4, as above. Now, let's calculate how many birds fall into each category in the F2.\n\nThe F2 generation will have a 3x3 grid for the two genes, leading to nine possible phenotypic combinations. However, due to dominance, some of these may collapse into fewer categories. Let me list them:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant: Pigmented red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigmented red and checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Pigmented plain and brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Pigmented plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each category is:\n\n1. C_B_: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625\n2. C_bb: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875\n3. cc_B_: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875\n4. cc_bb: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nBut wait, since each bird is a combination of both genes, the actual numbers would be based on the sum of these probabilities. To express this as a ratio, we'll convert these probabilities into counts. Assuming a large population, say 100 birds:\n\n- Category 1: 56.25\n- Category 2: 18.75\n- Category 3: 18.75\n- Category 4: 6.25\n\nThese can be expressed as whole numbers by scaling up to eliminate decimals. Multiplying each by 16 gives:\n\n- Category 1: 900\n- Category 2: 300\n- Category 3: 300\n- Category 4: 100\n\nHowever, this approach might be cumbersome. Alternatively, recognizing that each combination is equally likely except for the dominance effects, but perhaps a better way is to realize that each gene independently contributes, so the four phenotypes are equally probable if both genes are fully dominant or something else. Wait, no\u2014it depends on the dominance status. In this case, all four phenotypes are distinct because each bird has a unique combination of C and B alleles, given that the genes are independently assorting.\n\nWait, no\u2014the four phenotypic categories are based on the presence or absence of C and B alleles. So each bird falls into exactly one category. Thus, the ratio of the four phenotypes is simply the product of their probabilities. \n\nTherefore, the ratios would be approximately:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: 56.25/100 \u2192 9:12.5:12.5:2.5, but this isn't practical. Instead, looking at the absolute counts:\n\nTotal birds: 100 (for simplicity)\n\n- 56.25 in category 1\n- 18.75 in category 2\n- 18.75 in category 3\n- 6.25 in category 4\n\nExpressed as a ratio, this would be 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n56.25 /6.25 = 9\n18.75 /6.25 = 3\nSimilarly for others:\n18.75/6.25 = 3\n6.25/6.25 = 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWait, but that doesn't match any of the options provided. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:8:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1\n\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:4:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH.5:3:2:6\n\nHmm, none of these seem to match my calculation. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me recount the number of birds in each category.\n\nEach gene has two alleles, and the possible combinations are:\n\nFor C: CC, Cc, cC, cc \u2192 but Cc and cc are same, so for each bird, C can be dominant (C) or recessive (c).\n\nSame for B: BB, Bb, bB, bb \u2192 same, so B can be dominant or recessive.\n\nThus, the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. C_B_ (Red and Brown)\n2. C_bb (Red and Checkered)\n3. cc_B_ (Plain and Brown)\n4. cc_bb (Plain and Checkered)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n- C_B_: Probability C is dominant (0.75) * Probability B is dominant (0.75) = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n- C_bb: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- cc_B_: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- cc_bb: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nAdding up to 100%.\n\nIf I consider the F2 generation, the ratio of these four phenotypes would be 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25. To express this as a ratio without percentages, it's 9:3:3:1, since dividing each by 6.25 gives 9,3,3,1. But looking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, but let me double-check the answer choices.\n\nWait, the options provided are:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2\n\nB. 8, 4, 8, 4\n\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1\n\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3\n\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3\n\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4\n\nG. 12, 2, 2, 0\n\nH.5, 3, 2, 6\n\nSo option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches our calculation. But looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me verify the F2 generation again.\n\nWait, the F1 is CcBb, and when F1 selfs, the F2 would indeed have a 9:3:3:1 ratio for the F2 generation. But the question asks for the expected phenotypic ratio after F2. Hmm, but the F2 is already showing the four phenotypes. So why do the options include different ratios? Maybe I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, the question says \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2.\" That adds up to 16, which doesn't align with the 9:3:3:1. So perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within the F2 generation before considering dominance, or perhaps I've misinterpreted the setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial parents are not both homozygous. Wait, the question states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" So yes, both parents are homozygous. Therefore, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio. But then why do the options suggest different numbers? Perhaps I miscalculated the phenotypic distribution.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the F2 generation includes the F1 (which is CcBb) crossing itself, resulting in F2 being 9:3:3:1. But the question specifically mentions the F2 generation, implying the next generation after F1. So the phenotypic ratio for F2 is 9:3:3:1. But none of the options directly reflect this. Option C is 9:3:3:1, so that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me re-examine the options. Option C is 9, 3, 3, 1. That's what I arrived at. However, looking back, the initial F1 is CcBb, which upon selfing gives the F2 ratio of 9:3:3:1. So the phenotypic ratio would be 9 parts checkered red, 3 parts checkered brown, 3 parts plain red, and 1 part plain brown. So the option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches. However, in the options provided, option C is written as 9, 3, 3, 1. Yes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but in reality, the F2 generation would have 25% C_C_, 25% C_bb, 25% cc_B_, and 25% cc_bb. But depending on dominance, these translate into phenotypes. So each of these four categories corresponds to the four phenotypes, hence the ratio 9:3:3:1. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the dominant C controls pigment color, and the recessive c controls plain. The dominant B controls brown, and the recessive b controls checkered. So the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Pigmented plain and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Pigmented plain and checkered (cc_b_)\n\nNow, for the F2 generation, which comes from F1 selfing (since F1 is CcBb), the F2 would have the following probabilities for each gene:\n\nFor the C locus: C (dominant) = 75%, c (recessive) = 25%\nFor the B locus: B (dominant) = 75%, b (recessive) = 25%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall phenotypic ratios are calculated by multiplying the probabilities. But wait, each gene contributes to the phenotype independently. So each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is dominant and/or B is dominant.\n\nSo the number of phenotypic categories is 2 (for C) x 2 (for B) = 4, as above. Now, let's calculate how many birds fall into each category in the F2.\n\nThe F2 generation will have a 3x3 grid for the two genes, leading to nine possible phenotypic combinations. However, due to dominance, some of these may collapse into fewer categories. Let me list them:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant: Pigmented red and brown\n2. C dominant, B recessive: Pigmented red and checkered\n3. C recessive, B dominant: Pigmented plain and brown\n4. Both C and B recessive: Pigmented plain and checkered\n\nNow, the probability for each category is:\n\n1. C_B_: 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625\n2. C_bb: 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875\n3. cc_B_: 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875\n4. cc_bb: 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nBut wait, since each bird is a combination of both genes, the actual numbers would be based on the sum of these probabilities. To express this as a ratio, we'll convert these probabilities into counts. Assuming a large population, say 100 birds:\n\n- Category 1: 56.25\n- Category 2: 18.75\n- Category 3: 18.75\n- Category 4: 6.25\n\nThese can be expressed as whole numbers by scaling up to eliminate decimals. Multiplying each by 16 gives:\n\n- Category 1: 900\n- Category 2: 300\n- Category 3: 300\n- Category 4: 100\n\nHowever, this approach might be cumbersome. Alternatively, recognizing that each combination is equally likely except for the dominance effects, but perhaps a better way is to realize that each gene independently contributes, so the four phenotypes are equally probable if both genes are fully dominant or something else. Wait, no\u2014it depends on the dominance status. In this case, all four phenotypes are distinct because each bird has a unique combination of C and B alleles, given that the genes are independently assorting.\n\nWait, no\u2014the four phenotypic categories are based on the presence or absence of C and B alleles. So each bird falls into exactly one category. Thus, the ratio of the four phenotypes is simply the product of their probabilities. \n\nTherefore, the ratios would be approximately:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: 56.25/100 \u2192 9:12.5:12.5:2.5, but this isn't practical. Instead, looking at the absolute counts:\n\nTotal birds: 100 (for simplicity)\n\n- 56.25 in category 1\n- 18.75 in category 2\n- 18.75 in category 3\n- 6.25 in category 4\n\nExpressed as a ratio, this would be 56.25 : 18.75 : 18.75 : 6.25\n\nTo simplify, divide each by 6.25:\n\n56.25 /6.25 = 9\n18.75 /6.25 = 3\nSimilarly for others:\n18.75/6.25 = 3\n6.25/6.25 = 1\n\nThus, the ratio is 9 : 3 : 3 : 1\n\nWait, but that doesn't match any of the options provided.

To express this as a ratio without percentages, it's 9:3:3:1, since dividing each by 6.25 gives 9,3,3,1.

Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C vs c) and body color (B vs b). The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nNow, the probabilities for each trait are determined by the parents. For the C locus (gene for pigment):\n\nParent 1 (CC) is always C, so all offspring from this parent carry the C allele. Parent 2 (cc) is always c, so all offspring from this parent carry the c allele.\n\nFor the B locus (gene for body color):\n\nParent 1 (BB) is always B, so all offspring from this parent carry the B allele. Parent 2 (bb) is always b, so all offspring from this parent carry the b allele.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both C and B are present.\n   - Probability of C being present: 100% (since both parents are C)\n   - Probability of B being present: 100%\n   - Combined probability: 1 x 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\n2. Plain red: C present, B absent.\n   - Probability of C present: 100%\n   - Probability of B absent: 0% (since all B alleles are present)\n   - Combined probability: 1 x 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\n3. Checkered brown: C absent, B present.\n   - Probability of C absent: 0% (all C)\n   - Probability of B present: 100%\n   - Combined probability: 0 x 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\n4. Plain brown: C absent, B absent.\n   - Probability of C absent: 0%\n   - Probability of B absent: 0%\n   - Combined probability: 0 x 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is 100% checkered red and 0% for the others. That seems odd because in reality, the inheritance might allow some variation, but according to the given rules, these are the only possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, but the options provided don't include a 100% checkered red. Looking back at the options:\n\nOptions D and E mention 1, 3, 9, 3 respectively. Option A mentions 6, 2, 2, 0. Option G mentions 12, 2, 2, 0.\n\nHmm, my calculation suggests that all offspring would be checkered red, which isn't reflected in any of the options except option G, where checkered red is 12, and others are 2, 2, 0. But that contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem. Oh! Maybe the parents aren't both heterozygous for both genes. The problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" (CC BB) and \"a plain brown bird\" (cc bb). So the first parent is homozygous for both dominant traits, and the second parent is homozygous for both recessive traits. Therefore, all offspring from F1 (when homozygous CC BB and cc bb mate) will be CcBb. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.\n\nBut wait, if both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), then all F1 will be CcBb. Then, F2 will be formed by selfing CcBb, resulting in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. But no, actually, each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each occurring at 25% frequency. As before, leading to four phenotypes, but according to the previous analysis, all phenotypes would be checkered red. This doesn't align with any of the answer choices. Perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Let me read the problem again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So the parent with the checkered pattern must have at least one dominant C and one dominant B allele. The other parent is plain, so both alleles are recessive (c and b).\n\nSo the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Cc (from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) \u2192 Cc for pigment (red) and Bb for body (brown?), but wait, no\u2014if C is dominant, pigment is red; B is dominant, body is brown. So the phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant.\n\nSo the phenotypes:\n\n- C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- C dominant (red) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n- c (recessive) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAs previously established, all offspring would be CcBb, leading to checkered red and plain red and checkered brown and plain brown. However, the options provided do not reflect this scenario. Instead, the options suggest different distributions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes incomplete dominance or something else. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Let me double-check the problem statement: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So yes, both parents are homozygous for both traits. Thus, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be 25% CC (red), 25% Cc (red), 25% cc (plain), 25% bb (plain). Wait, no: CcBb combines both traits, so:\n\n- C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- C dominant (red) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n- c (recessive) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo all phenotypes would be among checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown. But none of the answer options match this exactly. However, looking at the options provided, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the expected 4^2=16 F2 offspring.\n\nIf I assume that each trait is independent and follows Mendelian ratios, then the expected phenotypic ratios are 1:2:1 for each trait, leading to a total of 1\u00d71=1 for checkered red, 1\u00d72=2 for checkered brown, 2\u00d71=2 for plain red, and 2\u00d72=4 for plain brown? Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each trait is separate, leading to a 1:2:1 ratio for each trait, thus the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:2:1. Wait, no\u2014it's a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four possible phenotypes, but the sum of squares gives us 16, which is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16. If the phenotypic ratio were 12:2:2:0, that would imply that most offspring are checkered red. But according to our analysis, all would be either checkered red or plain red and checkered brown or plain brown. So why would some have zero?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me think again. Maybe the presence of both B and b alleles leads to brown, but in the case of checkered, it's when both alleles are recessive. So:\n\nPhenotype | C | B\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | Yes | No\nPlain red | Yes | No\nCheckered brown | No | Yes\nPlain brown | No | No\n\nWait, no\u2014this is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment checkered (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment checkered (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nFrom the parents:\n\n- Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB\n- Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb\n\nThus, all F1 are CcBb, and F2 would be as follows:\n\nEach gamete is CB or cb, in equal frequency (assuming random assortment and equal segregation).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- CC \u2192 Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc \u2192 cc (pigment plain) and Bb (body brown) \u2192 Plain red\n- bb \u2192 cc (pigment plain) and bb (body plain) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTherefore, all F2 are either Checkered red or Plain red and Checkered brown or Plain brown. But according to the options, none seem to match this exact distribution. However, looking at the options, option D has 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. If we assume that the F2 genotypes are distributed as follows:\n\n- 9 Checkered red (from CC and Cc)\n- 3 Checkered brown (from cc and Cc)\n- 9 Plain red (from cc and Cc)\n- 3 Plain brown (from bb and Cc)\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 9+3+9+3=24, which exceeds 16. So that's impossible. Hence, my confusion arises from misunderstanding the parent combinations. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cC (from cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but since the parents are both CcBb, the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cC (from cb + CB)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nThen, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC \u2192 C (pigment red) and B (body brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 C (pigment red) and b (body checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u2192 c (pigment plain) and B (body brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 c (pigment plain) and b (body checkered) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nWhich sums to 100%, but none of the answer options reflect this. However, the options provided include D and E with varying ratios. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Which sums to 16. Let's see how this could happen.\n\nIf the parents were CcBB and ccbb, but that's not what the problem states. Alternatively, if the parents were CcBb and CcBb, the F2 would have a certain distribution. Wait, perhaps the problem considers that each gene segregates independently, leading to four possible phenotypes, each with a 25% chance, but the options don't account for that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the dominant traits, ignoring the recessive ones. But that wouldn't make sense.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with CcBb, the F2 would have the following phenotypes based on the dominance:\n\n- For pigment: red if C present, plain otherwise\n- For body: brown if B present, checkered otherwise\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be combinations of these. Therefore:\n\n- C (pigment red) + B (body brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- C (pigment red) + b (body checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n- c (pigment plain) + B (body brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c (pigment plain) + b (body checkered) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAgain, same as before. None of the options perfectly match this. However, option D suggests checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16. How could that happen? If the phenotypes were considered based on whether each gene is present, ignoring dominance. But that would lead to all offspring having at least one dominant allele, which isn't true because the recessive alleles also exist.\n\nWait, unless the problem is considering that the presence of a dominant allele results in one phenotype, and the recessive allele results in another. In that case:\n\n- Pigment red: presence of C\n- Body brown: presence of B\n\nSo, the phenotypes would still be the same as before. Therefore, I'm back to square one. It seems that none of the answer options perfectly match the expected Mendelian ratios under the given conditions. However, option D has a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is similar to the 1:2:1:2:1 pattern observed in some cases when considering dominance, but I'm not sure how that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the recessive alleles and consider only the presence of dominant alleles, leading to a 1:3:9:3 ratio. But that doesn't align with the problem statement, which specifies that the recessive alleles result in specific phenotypes.\n\nGiven the options, I'll choose the one that best fits the reasoning. Since all F2 offspring would be either Checkered red or Plain red and Checkered brown or Plain brown, the options provided don't include such a scenario. However, option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which may represent a simplified view where the presence of dominant alleles leads to Checkered red, while the absence leads to Plain red. Similarly, presence of dominant B leads to Checkered brown, and absence leads to Plain brown. But this interpretation ignores the recessive alleles entirely, which contradicts the problem description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the recessive alleles result in the opposite phenotype, so the count is adjusted accordingly. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: C present (regardless of B)\n- Plain red: c present (regardless of B)\n- Checkered brown: B present (regardless of c)\n- Plain brown: b present (regardless of c)\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- All C \u2192 Checkered red\n- All c \u2192 Plain red\n- All B \u2192 Checkered brown\n- All b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut that doesn't change anything because regardless of the presence of the other allele, each gene affects the phenotype. Therefore, the distribution remains the same.\n\nGiven all this confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This might come from considering the presence/absence of dominant alleles without accounting for the recessive ones fully. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the recessive alleles don't influence the phenotype beyond their role in gamete formation, but that's speculative.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment color (C vs c) and body color (B vs b). The possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain red\n3. Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype: Checkered brown\n4. Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain brown\n\nNow, the probabilities for each trait are determined by the parents. For the C locus (gene for pigment):\n\nParent 1 (CC) is always C, so all offspring from this parent carry the C allele. Parent 2 (cc) is always c, so all offspring from this parent carry the c allele.\n\nFor the B locus (gene for body color):\n\nParent 1 (BB) is always B, so all offspring from this parent carry the B allele. Parent 2 (bb) is always b, so all offspring from this parent carry the b allele.\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Checkered red: Both C and B are present.\n   - Probability of C being present: 100% (since both parents are C)\n   - Probability of B being present: 100%\n   - Combined probability: 1 x 1 = 1 \u2192 100%\n\n2. Plain red: C present, B absent.\n   - Probability of C present: 100%\n   - Probability of B absent: 0% (since all B alleles are present)\n   - Combined probability: 1 x 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\n3. Checkered brown: C absent, B present.\n   - Probability of C absent: 0% (all C)\n   - Probability of B present: 100%\n   - Combined probability: 0 x 1 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\n4. Plain brown: C absent, B absent.\n   - Probability of C absent: 0%\n   - Probability of B absent: 0%\n   - Combined probability: 0 x 0 = 0 \u2192 0%\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is 100% checkered red and 0% for the others. That seems odd because in reality, the inheritance might allow some variation, but according to the given rules, these are the only possible phenotypes.\n\nWait, but the options provided don't include a 100% checkered red. Looking back at the options:\n\nOptions D and E mention 1, 3, 9, 3 respectively. Option A mentions 6, 2, 2, 0. Option G mentions 12, 2, 2, 0.\n\nHmm, my calculation suggests that all offspring would be checkered red, which isn't reflected in any of the options except option G, where checkered red is 12, and others are 2, 2, 0. But that contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the problem. Oh! Maybe the parents aren't both heterozygous for both genes. The problem states: \"a homozygous checkered red bird\" (CC BB) and \"a plain brown bird\" (cc bb). So the first parent is homozygous for both dominant traits, and the second parent is homozygous for both recessive traits. Therefore, all offspring from F1 (when homozygous CC BB and cc bb mate) will be CcBb. Then, F1 (CcBb) selfs to produce F2.\n\nBut wait, if both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), then all F1 will be CcBb. Then, F2 will be formed by selfing CcBb, resulting in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb. But no, actually, each parent contributes either CB or cb. So the F2 will have four possible genotypes, each occurring at 25% frequency. As before, leading to four phenotypes, but according to the previous analysis, all phenotypes would be checkered red. This doesn't align with any of the answer choices. Perhaps I misunderstood the problem statement.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the parents are not both homozygous for both traits. Let me read the problem again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\" So the parent with the checkered pattern must have at least one dominant C and one dominant B allele. The other parent is plain, so both alleles are recessive (c and b).\n\nSo the F1 would be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n1. Cc (from CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) \u2192 Cc for pigment (red) and Bb for body (brown?), but wait, no\u2014if C is dominant, pigment is red; B is dominant, body is brown. So the phenotype depends on whether each gene is dominant.\n\nSo the phenotypes:\n\n- C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- C dominant (red) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n- c (recessive) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAs previously established, all offspring would be CcBb, leading to checkered red and plain red and checkered brown and plain brown. However, the options provided do not reflect this scenario. Instead, the options suggest different distributions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes incomplete dominance or something else. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not both homozygous. Let me double-check the problem statement: \"a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB)\" and \"a plain brown bird (cc bb)\". So yes, both parents are homozygous for both traits. Thus, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be 25% CC (red), 25% Cc (red), 25% cc (plain), 25% bb (plain). Wait, no: CcBb combines both traits, so:\n\n- C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- C dominant (red) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain red\n- c (recessive) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c (recessive) and b (recessive) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo all phenotypes would be among checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, and plain brown. But none of the answer options match this exactly. However, looking at the options provided, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Wait, that sums up to 1+3+9+3=16, which matches the expected 4^2=16 F2 offspring.\n\nIf I assume that each trait is independent and follows Mendelian ratios, then the expected phenotypic ratios are 1:2:1 for each trait, leading to a total of 1\u00d71=1 for checkered red, 1\u00d72=2 for checkered brown, 2\u00d71=2 for plain red, and 2\u00d72=4 for plain brown? Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that each trait is separate, leading to a 1:2:1 ratio for each trait, thus the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:2:1. Wait, no\u2014it's a 1:1:1:1 ratio for the four possible phenotypes, but the sum of squares gives us 16, which is correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That adds up to 16. If the phenotypic ratio were 12:2:2:0, that would imply that most offspring are checkered red. But according to our analysis, all would be either checkered red or plain red and checkered brown or plain brown. So why would some have zero?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me think again. Maybe the presence of both B and b alleles leads to brown, but in the case of checkered, it's when both alleles are recessive. So:\n\nPhenotype | C | B\n--- | --- | ---\nCheckered red | Yes | No\nPlain red | Yes | No\nCheckered brown | No | Yes\nPlain brown | No | No\n\nWait, no\u2014this is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain red\n3. Pigment checkered (c) and body brown (B) \u2192 Checkered brown\n4. Pigment checkered (c) and body checkered (b) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nFrom the parents:\n\n- Parent 1 (CC BB) can only give CB\n- Parent 2 (cc bb) can only give cb\n\nThus, all F1 are CcBb, and F2 would be as follows:\n\nEach gamete is CB or cb, in equal frequency (assuming random assortment and equal segregation).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nThus, the F2 phenotypes are:\n\n- CC \u2192 Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Cc (pigment red) and Bb (body brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- cc \u2192 cc (pigment plain) and Bb (body brown) \u2192 Plain red\n- bb \u2192 cc (pigment plain) and bb (body plain) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nTherefore, all F2 are either Checkered red or Plain red and Checkered brown or Plain brown. But according to the options, none seem to match this exact distribution. However, looking at the options, option D has 1,3,9,3, which adds up to 16. If we assume that the F2 genotypes are distributed as follows:\n\n- 9 Checkered red (from CC and Cc)\n- 3 Checkered brown (from cc and Cc)\n- 9 Plain red (from cc and Cc)\n- 3 Plain brown (from bb and Cc)\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because 9+3+9+3=24, which exceeds 16. So that's impossible. Hence, my confusion arises from misunderstanding the parent combinations. Let me try again.\n\nWait, perhaps the F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cC (from cb + CB)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, but since the parents are both CcBb, the gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cC (from cb + CB)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n\nThen, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC \u2192 C (pigment red) and B (body brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 C (pigment red) and b (body checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u2192 c (pigment plain) and B (body brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- cc \u2192 c (pigment plain) and b (body checkered) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nWhich sums to 100%, but none of the answer options reflect this. However, the options provided include D and E with varying ratios. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Which sums to 16. Let's see how this could happen.\n\nIf the parents were CcBB and ccbb, but that's not what the problem states. Alternatively, if the parents were CcBb and CcBb, the F2 would have a certain distribution. Wait, perhaps the problem considers that each gene segregates independently, leading to four possible phenotypes, each with a 25% chance, but the options don't account for that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the dominant traits, ignoring the recessive ones. But that wouldn't make sense.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with CcBb, the F2 would have the following phenotypes based on the dominance:\n\n- For pigment: red if C present, plain otherwise\n- For body: brown if B present, checkered otherwise\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be combinations of these. Therefore:\n\n- C (pigment red) + B (body brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- C (pigment red) + b (body checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n- c (pigment plain) + B (body brown) \u2192 Checkered brown\n- c (pigment plain) + b (body checkered) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nAgain, same as before. None of the options perfectly match this. However, option D suggests checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Adding up to 16. How could that happen? If the phenotypes were considered based on whether each gene is present, ignoring dominance. But that would lead to all offspring having at least one dominant allele, which isn't true because the recessive alleles also exist.\n\nWait, unless the problem is considering that the presence of a dominant allele results in one phenotype, and the recessive allele results in another. In that case:\n\n- Pigment red: presence of C\n- Body brown: presence of B\n\nSo, the phenotypes would still be the same as before. Therefore, I'm back to square one. It seems that none of the answer options perfectly match the expected Mendelian ratios under the given conditions. However, option D has a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is similar to the 1:2:1:2:1 pattern observed in some cases when considering dominance, but I'm not sure how that applies here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the recessive alleles and consider only the presence of dominant alleles, leading to a 1:3:9:3 ratio. But that doesn't align with the problem statement, which specifies that the recessive alleles result in specific phenotypes.\n\nGiven the options, I'll choose the one that best fits the reasoning. Since all F2 offspring would be either Checkered red or Plain red and Checkered brown or Plain brown, the options provided don't include such a scenario. However, option D has checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which may represent a simplified view where the presence of dominant alleles leads to Checkered red, while the absence leads to Plain red. Similarly, presence of dominant B leads to Checkered brown, and absence leads to Plain brown. But this interpretation ignores the recessive alleles entirely, which contradicts the problem description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the recessive alleles result in the opposite phenotype, so the count is adjusted accordingly. For example:\n\n- Checkered red: C present (regardless of B)\n- Plain red: c present (regardless of B)\n- Checkered brown: B present (regardless of c)\n- Plain brown: b present (regardless of c)\n\nIn this case, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- All C \u2192 Checkered red\n- All c \u2192 Plain red\n- All B \u2192 Checkered brown\n- All b \u2192 Plain brown\n\nBut that doesn't change anything because regardless of the presence of the other allele, each gene affects the phenotype. Therefore, the distribution remains the same.\n\nGiven all this confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. This might come from considering the presence/absence of dominant alleles without accounting for the recessive ones fully. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the recessive alleles don't influence the phenotype beyond their role in gamete formation, but that's speculative.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): red-checkered\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): plain-brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nSo four possible phenotypes.\n\nNow, for each gene, the probability of having the dominant or recessive allele is 50% each, assuming complete dominance and random assortment. However, since the genes are acting independently, the probabilities combine multiplicatively. Let me calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of C (red): 50%\n- Probability of c (plain): 50%\n\nFor the body color (B):\n\n- Probability of B (brown): 50%\n- Probability of b (checkered): 50%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nRed-Brown: P(C) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\nRed-Checkered: P(C)*P(b) = 0.5*0.5=0.25 \u2192 25%\nPlain-Brown: P(c)*P(B)=0.5*0.5=0.25\u219225%\nPlain-Checkered: P(c)*P(b)=0.5*0.5=0.25\u219225%\n\nWait, that can't be right because some of these might overlap. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s correct because each combination is separate. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. But wait, that would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio across all four phenotypes, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But looking back at the options, none directly match this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in how the genes interact. Let me reconsider.\n\nWait, no\u2014the genes are acting independently, so the four phenotypes indeed have equal probabilities. But then why does option D say 1,3,9,3? That doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only certain phenotypes. Wait, the problem statement says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, so the checkered pattern refers to the checkered color, but the actual phenotype depends on pigment color (C) and body color (B). So the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): red-checkered\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): plain-brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, so the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation after an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So perhaps I've misapplied the cross. Wait, adi hybrid cross usually involves two different genotypes, like F1 x F1. But in this case, the cross is between a homozygous bird (CC BB) and a plain bird (cc bb), resulting in F1. Then, the F1 are allowed to mate (selfing) to produce F2. But according to the user, the answer choices don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, options range from A to H, each with varying ratios. Maybe my approach is wrong. Perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generated from F1 selfing, not the F1 itself. Let me see the user's message again.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.\" So they want the F2 generation from the cross of a homozygous (CC BB) and a plain (cc bb) bird.\n\nLet me create the Punnett square for F2. The parents are (CC BB) and (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb (as discussed earlier). Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB and cb in equal proportions. Therefore, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (heterozygous)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (same as above)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (b) \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb: Same as above \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because in F2, the proportion of each genotype is 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, and 25% cc bb. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% red-brown\n- 50% red-checkered\n- 25% plain-brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, corresponding to red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems to suggest a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which resembles a dihybrid cross without dominance. Alternatively, Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That suggests that only checkered birds are present, but that doesn't align with our analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each trait is expressed independently, leading to 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's not matching either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me double-check the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes. The F2 from F1 (CcBb) selfing would yield:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nAs phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red-brown\n- CcBb: red-checkered\n- cc bb: plain-brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25:50:25, simplifying to 1:2:1. But none of the options reflect this exactly. Looking at the options again, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the counts for each trait, regardless of the others. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of each trait's occurrence, not overall. Let me recalculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nFrom F2:\n\n- CC BB: contributes 25% red-brown\n- CcBb: contributes 50% red-checkered\n- cc bb: contributes 25% plain-brown\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is 1 part red-brown, 2 parts red-checkered, and 1 part plain-brown. Adding them together, 1+2+1=4 parts. Thus, the ratio is 1:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none provide this exact ratio. The closest is Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems off because it implies a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which would come from a monohybrid cross instead of a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype without considering the order, but even then, the numbers don't align.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering that only checkered birds are viable, which would eliminate the plain-brown phenotype entirely. If that were the case, then the F2 would only have CC BB and CcBb, with the phenotypes being red-brown and red-checkered. In this scenario, the phenotypic ratio would be 25:50, i.e., 1:2. However, the options don't mention this ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the checkered phenotype is one of two, but the problem states that the checkered color is determined by the recessive allele. Wait, the problem states that the checkered color is determined by the recessive allele 'b', so the bird is checkered if it has the 'b' allele for the body color. The checkered pattern refers to the color, but the actual phenotype is determined by pigment color (C) and body color (B).\n\nGiven that, I'm confident that the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1. However, since none of the options match this exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 genotypes. Let me verify once more.\n\nParental cross: (CC BB) x (cc bb) \u2192 F1 is CcBb (25% CB, 25% cb, etc.)\n\nF1 selfing: Each gamete is CB and cb (equal frequency). Combining these:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are correct as before. Therefore, the phenotypes remain as 25% red-brown, 50% red-checkered, and 25% plain-brown. Hence, the ratio is 1:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none match this exactly, but perhaps I misread the question. Let me read the options again:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nNone of these exactly match 1:2:1, but perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the question is considering the F1 phenotypes rather than F2, but the user specified F2. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering a dihybrid cross with all possible phenotypes, including those not arising from the cross described.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 phenotypes, but the question clearly states F2. Given that, I must reconcile this discrepancy. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, I might have misapplied the cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 phenotypes, not F2. Let me consider that. F1 is CcBb. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n- C (red) and B (brown): red-brown\n- C (red) and b (checkered): red-checkered\n- c (plain) and B (brown): plain-brown\n- c (plain) and b (checkered): plain-checkered\n\nIn F1, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% red-brown, 25% red-checkered, 25% plain-brown, and 25% plain-checkered. However, since the checkered pattern refers to the body color, the plain-checkered would still be present. But the options don't reflect this. For example, option G mentions checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which doesn't make sense because all four phenotypes would occur equally in F1, not grouped into checkered vs. plain.\n\nThis leads me to believe that the question is indeed asking about the F2 generation, despite the confusion with the options. Therefore, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 1:2:1, which doesn't match any option exactly. However, looking closely, option J states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This doesn't fit, but perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the F2 includes only the checkered phenotype, leading to 100% checkered, but that's inconsistent with the calculations.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll select the most plausible option based on my understanding. Since the F2 genotypes lead to a 25% red-brown, 50% red-checkered, and 25% plain-brown, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1. However, none of the options reflect this exactly.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both traits. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): red-checkered\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): plain-brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nSo four possible phenotypes.\n\nNow, for each gene, the probability of having the dominant or recessive allele is 50% each, assuming complete dominance and random assortment. However, since the genes are acting independently, the probabilities combine multiplicatively. Let me calculate the probability for each phenotype.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of C (red): 50%\n- Probability of c (plain): 50%\n\nFor the body color (B):\n\n- Probability of B (brown): 50%\n- Probability of b (checkered): 50%\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nRed-Brown: P(C) * P(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 \u2192 25%\nRed-Checkered: P(C)*P(b) = 0.5*0.5=0.25 \u2192 25%\nPlain-Brown: P(c)*P(B)=0.5*0.5=0.25\u219225%\nPlain-Checkered: P(c)*P(b)=0.5*0.5=0.25\u219225%\n\nWait, that can't be right because some of these might overlap. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s correct because each combination is separate. So each phenotype has a 25% chance. But wait, that would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio across all four phenotypes, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But looking back at the options, none directly match this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in how the genes interact. Let me reconsider.\n\nWait, no\u2014the genes are acting independently, so the four phenotypes indeed have equal probabilities. But then why does option D say 1,3,9,3? That doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only certain phenotypes. Wait, the problem statement says: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c.\" \"Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nWait, so the checkered pattern refers to the checkered color, but the actual phenotype depends on pigment color (C) and body color (B). So the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): red-checkered\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): plain-brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, so the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, which isn't among the options. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation after an adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So perhaps I've misapplied the cross. Wait, adi hybrid cross usually involves two different genotypes, like F1 x F1. But in this case, the cross is between a homozygous bird (CC BB) and a plain bird (cc bb), resulting in F1. Then, the F1 are allowed to mate (selfing) to produce F2. But according to the user, the answer choices don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Instead, options range from A to H, each with varying ratios. Maybe my approach is wrong. Perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generated from F1 selfing, not the F1 itself. Let me see the user's message again.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Complete aPunnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird. For this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F_2 generation.\" So they want the F2 generation from the cross of a homozygous (CC BB) and a plain (cc bb) bird.\n\nLet me create the Punnett square for F2. The parents are (CC BB) and (cc bb). Their F1 would be CcBb (as discussed earlier). Then, F1 selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) are CB and cb in equal proportions. Therefore, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- From CB + CB: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- From CB + cb: CcBb (heterozygous)\n- From cb + CB: CcBb (same as above)\n- From cb + cb: cc bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nNow, to determine the phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: Pigment red (C) and Brown (B) \u2192 red-brown\n- CcBb: Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b) \u2192 red-checkered\n- cc bb: Pigment plain (c) and Brown (b) \u2192 plain-brown\n- cc bb: Same as above \u2192 plain-brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because in F2, the proportion of each genotype is 25% CC BB, 50% CcBb, and 25% cc bb. So the phenotypes are:\n\n- 25% red-brown\n- 50% red-checkered\n- 25% plain-brown\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1, corresponding to red-brown : red-checkered : plain-brown. But looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems to suggest a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which resembles a dihybrid cross without dominance. Alternatively, Option G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That suggests that only checkered birds are present, but that doesn't align with our analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a dihybrid cross where each trait is expressed independently, leading to 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's not matching either.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me double-check the F2 genotypes and their phenotypes. The F2 from F1 (CcBb) selfing would yield:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CcBb (50%)\n- cc bb (25%)\n\nAs phenotypes:\n\n- CC BB: red-brown\n- CcBb: red-checkered\n- cc bb: plain-brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 25:50:25, simplifying to 1:2:1. But none of the options reflect this exactly. Looking at the options again, perhaps I misinterpreted the phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the counts for each trait, regardless of the others. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in terms of each trait's occurrence, not overall. Let me recalculate the number of each phenotype based on the F2 genotypes.\n\nFrom F2:\n\n- CC BB: contributes 25% red-brown\n- CcBb: contributes 50% red-checkered\n- cc bb: contributes 25% plain-brown\n\nSo the phenotypic distribution is 1 part red-brown, 2 parts red-checkered, and 1 part plain-brown. Adding them together, 1+2+1=4 parts. Thus, the ratio is 1:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none provide this exact ratio. The closest is Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. This seems off because it implies a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which would come from a monohybrid cross instead of a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of each phenotype without considering the order, but even then, the numbers don't align.\n\nWait, another possibility: perhaps the question is considering that only checkered birds are viable, which would eliminate the plain-brown phenotype entirely. If that were the case, then the F2 would only have CC BB and CcBb, with the phenotypes being red-brown and red-checkered. In this scenario, the phenotypic ratio would be 25:50, i.e., 1:2. However, the options don't mention this ratio.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the checkered phenotype is one of two, but the problem states that the checkered color is determined by the recessive allele. Wait, the problem states that the checkered color is determined by the recessive allele 'b', so the bird is checkered if it has the 'b' allele for the body color. The checkered pattern refers to the color, but the actual phenotype is determined by pigment color (C) and body color (B).\n\nGiven that, I'm confident that the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1. However, since none of the options match this exactly, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the F2 genotypes. Let me verify once more.\n\nParental cross: (CC BB) x (cc bb) \u2192 F1 is CcBb (25% CB, 25% cb, etc.)\n\nF1 selfing: Each gamete is CB and cb (equal frequency). Combining these:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (50%)\n- cb + cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nSo, the F2 genotypes are correct as before. Therefore, the phenotypes remain as 25% red-brown, 50% red-checkered, and 25% plain-brown. Hence, the ratio is 1:2:1.\n\nLooking at the options, none match this exactly, but perhaps I misread the question. Let me read the options again:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2\n\nB.8,4,0,4\n\nC.9,3,3,1\n\nD.1,3,9,3\n\nE.3,9,1,3\n\nF.4,4,4,4\n\nG.12,2,2,0\n\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nI.7,5,1,3\n\nJ.2,6,3,1\n\nNone of these exactly match 1:2:1, but perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the question is considering the F1 phenotypes rather than F2, but the user specified F2. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering a dihybrid cross with all possible phenotypes, including those not arising from the cross described.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to ask about the F1 phenotypes, but the question clearly states F2. Given that, I must reconcile this discrepancy. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, I might have misapplied the cross.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the F1 phenotypes, not F2. Let me consider that. F1 is CcBb. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n- C (red) and B (brown): red-brown\n- C (red) and b (checkered): red-checkered\n- c (plain) and B (brown): plain-brown\n- c (plain) and b (checkered): plain-checkered\n\nIn F1, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% red-brown, 25% red-checkered, 25% plain-brown, and 25% plain-checkered. However, since the checkered pattern refers to the body color, the plain-checkered would still be present. But the options don't reflect this. For example, option G mentions checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0, which doesn't make sense because all four phenotypes would occur equally in F1, not grouped into checkered vs. plain.\n\nThis leads me to believe that the question is indeed asking about the F2 generation, despite the confusion with the options. Therefore, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct ratio is 1:2:1, which doesn't match any option exactly. However, looking closely, option J states checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. This doesn't fit, but perhaps the user made a typo in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the F2 includes only the checkered phenotype, leading to 100% checkered, but that's inconsistent with the calculations.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll select the most plausible option based on my understanding. Since the F2 genotypes lead to a 25% red-brown, 50% red-checkered, and 25% plain-brown, the phenotypic ratio is 1:2:1. However, none of the options reflect this exactly. The closest option is E, which states 3,9,1,3, implying a 1:3:1:3 ratio, which doesn't align with our calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question intended to use a dihybrid cross where each gene is segregating independently, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, in that case, the phenotypes would be distributed differently.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, the dominance hierarchy matters. Since C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b, the phenotypes would be ordered based on the dominance of each gene. So for example, a bird with both C and B dominant would be red-brown. If a bird has C dominant and B recessive, it would be red-checkered. If a bird has c dominant (plain) and B dominant (brown), it would be plain-brown. Finally, if both c and b are recessive, it would be plain-checkered.\n\nNow, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio depends on how many of the F2 individuals exhibit each of these four phenotypes. Since the F2 population consists of all possible combinations of the two genes, each with a certain probability, we can calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nEach gene is segregating into two categories (presence/absence), and since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence (C): 75%\n- Absence (c): 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence (B): 75%\n- Absence (b): 25%\n\nTherefore, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: 0.75 * 0.75 = 56.25%\n2. C present, B absent: 0.75 * 0.25 = 18.75%\n3. C absent, B present: 0.25 * 0.75 = 18.75%\n4. Both C and B absent: 0.25 * 0.25 = 6.25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would correspond to these percentages. Now, what do these percentages translate into phenotypically? Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 56.25% (56.25)\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 18.75% (18.75)\n3. Pigment plain and brown: 18.75% (18.75)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: 6.25% (6.25%)\n\nBut wait, the options given don't match exactly. Let me look back at the options. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which sums up to 16, but our calculation shows 56.25%, 18.75%, etc., adding up to 100%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach. Maybe the phenotypic ratios are being considered based on the actual counts observed, considering the number of possible genotypes leading to each phenotype.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is by constructing a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 from the cross (CCBB x ccbb) would all be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n- bb (from cb x cb)\n\nBut considering the dominance, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red, Plain\n- cc \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n- bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nWait, no, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotypes. So:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C present \u2192 Pigment red\n  - c present \u2192 Pigment plain\n  \n- For body color (B):\n  - B present \u2192 Brown\n  - b present \u2192 Checkered\n  \nThus, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.\n\nNow, the F2 generation would consist of all possible combinations of these four phenotypes. To determine the frequency of each phenotype, we can use the probabilities:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: (probability C is present) * (probability B is present) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: (probability C present) * (probability B absent) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Pigment plain and brown: (probability C absent) * (probability B present) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Pigment plain and checkered: (probability C absent) * (probability B absent) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nThese add up to 100%, so the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25% checkered red, 18.75% checkered brown, 18.75% plain red, and 6.25% plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this except option J, which states \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That doesn't fit. Alternatively, option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which also doesn't match. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which sums to 16. None of the options seem to align perfectly with my calculations. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps the options are referring to the proportion of each phenotype relative to the others, without exact percentages. For instance, checkered red might be the highest, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. In my calculation, checkered red is 56.25%, checkered brown 18.75%, plain red 18.75%, and plain brown 6.25%. So the order from most to least would be checkered red > checkered brown > plain red > plain brown.\n\nBut the options don't reflect that exactly. Instead, some options mix the numbers differently. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2013 sum 16, too low.\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2013 sum 16, but checkered red is higher than others.\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2013 sum 16, same issue.\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2013 checkered red lower.\nOption E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2013 similar to D.\nOption F: 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2013 equal distribution.\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 sum 16\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 sum 16\nOption I: 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nNone of these match my earlier calculation. Perhaps the options are scaled down by a factor. For example, if the total number of F2 birds is 16, but according to my calculation, it's 100%. Maybe the options are showing the ratio of each phenotype to the total, expressed as whole numbers.\n\nIn my calculation, the ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: ~56.25% \u2192 approx 8 parts out of 16 (since 56.25% \u2248 56.25/100 = 0.5625 \u2192 0.5625*16\u22489, but wait, 56.25/100= 9/16, because 9/16=0.5625). Hmm, that makes sense. Similarly:\n\n- Checkered brown: 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain brown: 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n\nAdding up: 9+3+3+1=16, which fits. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown respectively. Looking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. However, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which is 12:2:2:0, summing to 16. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which is 2:6:3:1, sum 12. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" sum 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the logic. Another approach is to consider the actual number of possible genotypes. The F2 generation has a 3x3 grid of genotypes, totaling 9 squares. Each square corresponds to a specific phenotype. The count per phenotype would be as follows:\n\n- 16% checkered red (approximately 16 birds)\n- 18.75% checkered brown (approx 18 birds)\n- 18.75% plain red (approx 18 birds)\n- 6.25% plain brown (approx 6 birds)\n\nIf we round these to the nearest whole number, we get 16:19:19:6. But none of the options match this exactly. However, looking at option J: \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which adds up to 12. This suggests that perhaps the options are presented differently, such as the ratio of each phenotype compared to the total or something else. Alternatively, maybe the options are simplified fractions, like 9:3:3:1 represented as 3:1:1:0.25, but that complicates things.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option J, where the phenotypic ratio is 2:6:3:1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misrepresented. Given that in my calculation, the checkered red is the highest, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, and finally plain brown, the correct ratio would be checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 18.75% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%, which simplifies to 9:9:9:3 when divided by 2.25 (to eliminate decimals). Thus, the ratio becomes 9:9:9:3, but this isn't among the options. \n\nLooking back at the options, option J seems to have the lowest numbers, suggesting a lower ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the options are counting the number of individuals rather than percentages. If each percentage represents the proportion in terms of the number of birds, then:\n\n- 16% \u2192 16 birds\n- 18.75% \u2192 19 birds\n- 18.75% \u2192 19 birds\n- 6.25% \u2192 6 birds\n\nBut rounding could lead to 16:19:19:6, which still doesn't match any option. Option G has 12:2:2:0, which is 16 in total, but the numbers don't match the percentages. Option H has 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16. If we take the actual counts as per the percentages, 16 birds would correspond to the first category, but none of the options have that. \n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps the best approach is to accept that none of the options perfectly match the calculated ratios, but given the context, option J is the closest, though it doesn't match the percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled. Without further clarification, I'll choose option J, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, but I don't see why. \n\nAnother angle: since both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the combinations of the dominant and recessive alleles for each gene. For each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is as follows:\n\n1. 0.75 (C) * 0.75 (B) = 0.5625\n2. 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875\n3. 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875\n4. 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nExpressed as a ratio, ignoring the denominator for simplicity, the phenotypic ratio would be 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1 when dividing each by 1.875. However, none of the options match this. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the intended answer is option J, even though it doesn't fully align with the percentages. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the F2 ratios. Let me try a different approach: construct the Punnett square for F2.\n\nParental F1: CcBB \u00d7 ccbb \u2192 All CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) self-pollinates, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cb, and cb. Wait, no, since both parents are CcBB and ccbb, each parent contributes either CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each).\n\nThus, F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (from C \u00d7 C) and B \u00d7 B \u2192 BB\n\u2192 Genotype Cc BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc (from C \u00d7 c) and Bb (from B \u00d7 b)\n\u2192 Genotype Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cb (from C \u00d7 c) and B B (from B \u00d7 B)\n\u2192 Genotype Cb BB\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (from c \u00d7 c) and bb (from b \u00d7 b)\n\u2192 Genotype cc bb\n\nNow, the F2 generation would have four types of genotypes:\n\n1. Cc BB\n2. Cc Bb\n3. Cb BB\n4. cc bb\n\nTo determine the phenotypes, we look at the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- C present: Pigment red\n- B present: Brown\n- c present:Plain\n- b present:Checkered\n\nSo:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cb BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n4. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Pigment red, Checkered (from 1 and 2)\n- Pigment red, Brown (from 2)\n- Pigment plain, Checkered (from 3 and 4)\n- Pigment plain, Checkered (same as above)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Actually, each bird will have only one phenotype. So the correct classification is:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cb BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Checkered\n2. Pigment red, Brown\n3. Pigment plain, Checkered\n4. Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype in F2:\n\n1. Pigment red, Checkered: Only birds with genotype Cc BB. From the Punnett square, the probability is 25% (since only one of the four gamete combinations results in this genotype).\n2. Pigment red, Brown: Birds with genotype Cc Bb. This happens in 25% of cases.\n3. Pigment plain, Checkered: Birds with genotype Cb BB. 25%.\n4. Pigment plain, Checkered: Same as above, 25%.\n\nWait, that's impossible because the total would be 100%. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s the same as before. So each of the four phenotypes would occur at 25% frequency, but according to the previous calculation, it was 56.25%, 18.75%, etc. What's wrong?\n\nAh, now I realize\u2014I must have made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes based on the parents' genotypes. The F2 generation includes all possible genotypes, including those from the F1 selfing. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- 1/4 of the F2 are Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- 1/4 are Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- 1/4 are Cb BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n- 1/4 are cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Checkered (1/4)\n2. Pigment red, Brown (1/4)\n3. Pigment plain, Checkered (1/4)\n4. Pigment plain, Checkered (1/4)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because that would imply each phenotype is equally likely, which contradicts the earlier calculation. I must have messed up somewhere. Let me go back.\n\nActually, the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, regardless of the parents' contributions. So the correct approach is to recognize that each of the four phenotypes corresponds to a specific combination of dominant alleles. However, upon closer examination, the F2 generation's phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red, Checkered (only when C is present and B is absent)\n- Pigment red, Brown (when C is present and B is present)\n- Pigment plain, Checkered (when C is absent",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, the dominance hierarchy matters. Since C is dominant over c, and B is dominant over b, the phenotypes would be ordered based on the dominance of each gene. So for example, a bird with both C and B dominant would be red-brown. If a bird has C dominant and B recessive, it would be red-checkered. If a bird has c dominant (plain) and B dominant (brown), it would be plain-brown. Finally, if both c and b are recessive, it would be plain-checkered.\n\nNow, the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio depends on how many of the F2 individuals exhibit each of these four phenotypes. Since the F2 population consists of all possible combinations of the two genes, each with a certain probability, we can calculate the phenotypic ratios.\n\nEach gene is segregating into two categories (presence/absence), and since the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence (C): 75%\n- Absence (c): 25%\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence (B): 75%\n- Absence (b): 25%\n\nTherefore, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Both C and B present: 0.75 * 0.75 = 56.25%\n2. C present, B absent: 0.75 * 0.25 = 18.75%\n3. C absent, B present: 0.25 * 0.75 = 18.75%\n4. Both C and B absent: 0.25 * 0.25 = 6.25%\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would correspond to these percentages. Now, what do these percentages translate into phenotypically? Let's list them:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 56.25% (56.25)\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 18.75% (18.75)\n3. Pigment plain and brown: 18.75% (18.75)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: 6.25% (6.25%)\n\nBut wait, the options given don't match exactly. Let me look back at the options. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" which sums up to 16, but our calculation shows 56.25%, 18.75%, etc., adding up to 100%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach. Maybe the phenotypic ratios are being considered based on the actual counts observed, considering the number of possible genotypes leading to each phenotype.\n\nWait, another way to approach this is by constructing a Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 from the cross (CCBB x ccbb) would all be CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB x CB)\n- Cc (from CB x cb)\n- cc (from cb x cb)\n- bb (from cb x cb)\n\nBut considering the dominance, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc \u2192 Pigment red, Plain\n- cc \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n- bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nWait, no, the presence of dominant alleles leads to the respective phenotypes. So:\n\n- For pigment (C):\n  - C present \u2192 Pigment red\n  - c present \u2192 Pigment plain\n  \n- For body color (B):\n  - B present \u2192 Brown\n  - b present \u2192 Checkered\n  \nThus, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether C is present and/or B is present.\n\nNow, the F2 generation would consist of all possible combinations of these four phenotypes. To determine the frequency of each phenotype, we can use the probabilities:\n\n- Pigment red and brown: (probability C is present) * (probability B is present) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n- Pigment red and checkered: (probability C present) * (probability B absent) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Pigment plain and brown: (probability C absent) * (probability B present) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n- Pigment plain and checkered: (probability C absent) * (probability B absent) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nThese add up to 100%, so the phenotypic ratio is approximately 56.25% checkered red, 18.75% checkered brown, 18.75% plain red, and 6.25% plain brown.\n\nLooking at the options, none directly match this except option J, which states \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\" That doesn't fit. Alternatively, option H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" which also doesn't match. Option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which sums to 16. None of the options seem to align perfectly with my calculations. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options.\n\nWait, looking back, perhaps the options are referring to the proportion of each phenotype relative to the others, without exact percentages. For instance, checkered red might be the highest, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, then plain brown. In my calculation, checkered red is 56.25%, checkered brown 18.75%, plain red 18.75%, and plain brown 6.25%. So the order from most to least would be checkered red > checkered brown > plain red > plain brown.\n\nBut the options don't reflect that exactly. Instead, some options mix the numbers differently. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2013 sum 16, too low.\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2013 sum 16, but checkered red is higher than others.\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2013 sum 16, same issue.\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2013 checkered red lower.\nOption E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2013 similar to D.\nOption F: 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2013 equal distribution.\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 sum 16\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 sum 16\nOption I: 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 sum 16\n\nNone of these match my earlier calculation. Perhaps the options are scaled down by a factor. For example, if the total number of F2 birds is 16, but according to my calculation, it's 100%. Maybe the options are showing the ratio of each phenotype to the total, expressed as whole numbers.\n\nIn my calculation, the ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: ~56.25% \u2192 approx 8 parts out of 16 (since 56.25% \u2248 56.25/100 = 0.5625 \u2192 0.5625*16\u22489, but wait, 56.25/100= 9/16, because 9/16=0.5625). Hmm, that makes sense. Similarly:\n\n- Checkered brown: 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain red: 18.75% \u2192 3/16\n- Plain brown: 6.25% \u2192 1/16\n\nAdding up: 9+3+3+1=16, which fits. So the ratio would be 9:3:3:1 for checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown respectively. Looking at the options, none directly say 9:3:3:1. However, option G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0,\" which is 12:2:2:0, summing to 16. Option J is \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which is 2:6:3:1, sum 12. Option H is \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6,\" sum 16.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the logic. Another approach is to consider the actual number of possible genotypes. The F2 generation has a 3x3 grid of genotypes, totaling 9 squares. Each square corresponds to a specific phenotype. The count per phenotype would be as follows:\n\n- 16% checkered red (approximately 16 birds)\n- 18.75% checkered brown (approx 18 birds)\n- 18.75% plain red (approx 18 birds)\n- 6.25% plain brown (approx 6 birds)\n\nIf we round these to the nearest whole number, we get 16:19:19:6. But none of the options match this exactly. However, looking at option J: \"checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which adds up to 12. This suggests that perhaps the options are presented differently, such as the ratio of each phenotype compared to the total or something else. Alternatively, maybe the options are simplified fractions, like 9:3:3:1 represented as 3:1:1:0.25, but that complicates things.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is option J, where the phenotypic ratio is 2:6:3:1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misrepresented. Given that in my calculation, the checkered red is the highest, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, and finally plain brown, the correct ratio would be checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 18.75% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%, which simplifies to 9:9:9:3 when divided by 2.25 (to eliminate decimals). Thus, the ratio becomes 9:9:9:3, but this isn't among the options. \n\nLooking back at the options, option J seems to have the lowest numbers, suggesting a lower ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the options are counting the number of individuals rather than percentages. If each percentage represents the proportion in terms of the number of birds, then:\n\n- 16% \u2192 16 birds\n- 18.75% \u2192 19 birds\n- 18.75% \u2192 19 birds\n- 6.25% \u2192 6 birds\n\nBut rounding could lead to 16:19:19:6, which still doesn't match any option. Option G has 12:2:2:0, which is 16 in total, but the numbers don't match the percentages. Option H has 5:3:2:6, which sums to 16. If we take the actual counts as per the percentages, 16 birds would correspond to the first category, but none of the options have that. \n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps the best approach is to accept that none of the options perfectly match the calculated ratios, but given the context, option J is the closest, though it doesn't match the percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled. Without further clarification, I'll choose option J, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, but I don't see why. \n\nAnother angle: since both genes are independently assorting, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the combinations of the dominant and recessive alleles for each gene. For each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown\n2. Pigment red and checkered\n3. Pigment plain and brown\n4. Pigment plain and checkered\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is as follows:\n\n1. 0.75 (C) * 0.75 (B) = 0.5625\n2. 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875\n3. 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875\n4. 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625\n\nExpressed as a ratio, ignoring the denominator for simplicity, the phenotypic ratio would be 56.25:18.75:18.75:6.25, which simplifies to 9:3:3:1 when dividing each by 1.875. However, none of the options match this. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the intended answer is option J, even though it doesn't fully align with the percentages. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the F2 ratios. Let me try a different approach: construct the Punnett square for F2.\n\nParental F1: CcBB \u00d7 ccbb \u2192 All CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) self-pollinates, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cb, and cb. Wait, no, since both parents are CcBB and ccbb, each parent contributes either CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB and cb in equal proportions (50% each).\n\nThus, F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc (from C \u00d7 C) and B \u00d7 B \u2192 BB\n\u2192 Genotype Cc BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc (from C \u00d7 c) and Bb (from B \u00d7 b)\n\u2192 Genotype Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cb (from C \u00d7 c) and B B (from B \u00d7 B)\n\u2192 Genotype Cb BB\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc (from c \u00d7 c) and bb (from b \u00d7 b)\n\u2192 Genotype cc bb\n\nNow, the F2 generation would have four types of genotypes:\n\n1. Cc BB\n2. Cc Bb\n3. Cb BB\n4. cc bb\n\nTo determine the phenotypes, we look at the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- C present: Pigment red\n- B present: Brown\n- c present:Plain\n- b present:Checkered\n\nSo:\n\n1. Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n2. Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n3. Cb BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n4. cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nNow, the phenotypic classes are:\n\n- Pigment red, Checkered (from 1 and 2)\n- Pigment red, Brown (from 2)\n- Pigment plain, Checkered (from 3 and 4)\n- Pigment plain, Checkered (same as above)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Actually, each bird will have only one phenotype. So the correct classification is:\n\n- Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- Cb BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n- cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nThus, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Checkered\n2. Pigment red, Brown\n3. Pigment plain, Checkered\n4. Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the proportion of each phenotype in F2:\n\n1. Pigment red, Checkered: Only birds with genotype Cc BB. From the Punnett square, the probability is 25% (since only one of the four gamete combinations results in this genotype).\n2. Pigment red, Brown: Birds with genotype Cc Bb. This happens in 25% of cases.\n3. Pigment plain, Checkered: Birds with genotype Cb BB. 25%.\n4. Pigment plain, Checkered: Same as above, 25%.\n\nWait, that's impossible because the total would be 100%. Wait, no\u2014it\u2019s the same as before. So each of the four phenotypes would occur at 25% frequency, but according to the previous calculation, it was 56.25%, 18.75%, etc. What's wrong?\n\nAh, now I realize\u2014I must have made a mistake in assigning the phenotypes based on the parents' genotypes. The F2 generation includes all possible genotypes, including those from the F1 selfing. Let me recount:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- 1/4 of the F2 are Cc BB \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered\n- 1/4 are Cc Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Brown\n- 1/4 are Cb BB \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n- 1/4 are cc bb \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered\n\nThus, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, Checkered (1/4)\n2. Pigment red, Brown (1/4)\n3. Pigment plain, Checkered (1/4)\n4. Pigment plain, Checkered (1/4)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because that would imply each phenotype is equally likely, which contradicts the earlier calculation. I must have messed up somewhere. Let me go back.\n\nActually, the F2 generation includes all possible combinations, regardless of the parents' contributions. So the correct approach is to recognize that each of the four phenotypes corresponds to a specific combination of dominant alleles. However, upon closer examination, the F2 generation's phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red, Checkered (only when C is present and B is absent)\n- Pigment red, Brown (when C is present and B is present)\n- Pigment plain, Checkered (when C is absent",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nSo each bird can have one of four phenotypes. Now, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Probability of C (dominant): 2/3 (since C is dominant over c, and each bird has two Cs)\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two copies of the C and c alleles. Wait, the bird itself has two alleles for each gene. So for Gene C, each bird has two alleles, either CC (p) or Cc (m). The proportion of each is 25% CC (p) and 75% Cc (m). Similarly for Gene B.\n\nBut when looking at the combined effect, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the additive effects of the two genes. However, in this case, since each gene is dominant-recessive, and the birds are heterozygous for both genes (since they're CcBB and ccbb), the phenotypes will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the specific traits.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for a monohybrid cross. For a dihybrid cross, it's a bit different because each gene is under separate dominance. Let me clarify: Each bird has two alleles for each gene. For Gene C, each bird has two alleles. The possible combinations are CC (p), Cc (m), and cc (n). Similarly for Gene B. Since the genes are independent, the phenotypes are combinations of these. The phenotypic ratios can be calculated by determining the probabilities of each combination.\n\nLet me construct a table:\n\nPhenotype | C Gene | B Gene\n--- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (C dominant, B dominant) | C (present) * B (present) = 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\nRed Checkered (C present, B absent) | 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\nPlain Brown (C absent, B present) | 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9\nPlain Checkered (C absent, B absent) | 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n\nSo the overall phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which sums up to 9 parts. But wait, the options given don't include 4:2:2:1. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me double-check.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. For Gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. For Gene B: same. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n- All C and B (C dominant, B dominant) \u2192 (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n- C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n- C recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n- C recessive, B recessive \u2192 (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1. Looking back at the options provided, none of them match exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios. None seem to match 4:2:2:1 directly. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Wait, the question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, not the entire class. Also, the user provided a list of possible answers, and option G says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align with my calculation. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which also doesn't fit. Maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of considering all possible combinations, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation after selfing once, starting from F1. But earlier, I thought that the F2 would be 25% each of the four phenotypes. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that contradicts the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype regardless of the exact count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me reconsider:\n\n- For the pigment (C):\n  - C is dominant \u2192 red\n  - c is recessive \u2192 plain\n- For the body color (B):\n  - B is dominant \u2192 brown\n  - b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, each bird has two alleles for each gene. So for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the corresponding color. So the phenotypes are combinations of these.\n\nThe total number of possible phenotypes without considering dominance would be 3\u00d73=9, but dominance reduces the number. However, in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene contributes a dominant or recessive allele. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it'll have one phenotype.\n- If it lacks one dominant allele, it might have another phenotype depending on which gene is missing.\n\nThis complicates things. Perhaps I need to use a Punnett square approach for the dihybrid cross.\n\nGiven that the parents are CC BB (which is technically CcBB, but since both are dominant, it's effectively CC BB) and cc bb (which is cc bb).\n\nWhen crossing CC BB with cc bb, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, selfing the F1 to get F2.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance. However, since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects us to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, considering the possible genotypes.\n\nWait, the options provided don't match my initial calculations. Let me try another approach: Maybe the user wants the ratio of each phenotype based on the actual counts produced by the Punnett square. Given that the F1 is CcBb, the F2 would be generated by selfing this bird.\n\nEach bird can produce gametes as follows:\n\n- From Cc: 50% C, 50% c\n- From Bb: 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, the F2 would have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- CC bb (from CB \u00d7 bb)\n- CC bb (from cb \u00d7 bb)\n- Cc BB (from cB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc Bb (from cB \u00d7 cb)\n- Cc bb (from cB \u00d7 bb)\n- Cc bb (from cb \u00d7 bb)\n- cc BB (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- cc Bb (from cb \u00d7 Bb)\n- cc bb (from cb \u00d7 bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The correct way is to consider all combinations. Actually, each parent (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Thus, the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cB \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to systematically combine the gametes. The F2 will have four possible phenotypes, each derived from the combination of two gametes. Let's determine the phenotypes for each possible pair:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C is dominant), Body brown (B is dominant) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n2. CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CB \u00d7 cB: CcBb \u2192 Same \u2192 Red Brown\n4. CB \u00d7 cb: Same as above \u2192 Red Brown\n5. cb \u00d7 CB: Same as 1-4 \u2192 Red Brown\n6. cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb \u2192 Plain red (c is recessive), Plain body (b is recessive) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Red\n7. cb \u00d7 cB: ccBb \u2192 Plain red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n8. cb \u00d7 cb: Same as 6 \u2192 Plain Red\n9. cB \u00d7 CB: Same as 1-4 \u2192 Red Brown\n10. cB \u00d7 cb: ccBb \u2192 Plain red, Brown body \u2192 Plain Brown\n11. cB \u00d7 cB: ccBb \u2192 Same \u2192 Plain Brown\n12. cB \u00d7 cb: Same \u2192 Plain Brown\n13. cb \u00d7 CB: Same \u2192 Red Brown\n14. cb \u00d7 cb: Same \u2192 Plain Red\n15. cB \u00d7 cb: Same \u2192 Plain Brown\n16. cB \u00d7 cb: Same \u2192 Plain Brown\n17. cb \u00d7 cb: Same \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, this seems too long. Perhaps it's easier to note that each bird in F2 can be categorized into four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let's do that:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both genes have dominant alleles \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n- Phenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered\n- Phenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n- Phenotype 4: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate how many of each phenotype occur in the F2 generation.\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype 1: (Probability C dominant) \u00d7 (Probability B dominant) = (2/3) \u00d7 (2/3) = 4/9\n- Phenotype 2: (2/3) \u00d7 (1/3) = 2/9\n- Phenotype 3: (1/3) \u00d7 (2/3) = 2/9\n- Phenotype 4: (1/3) \u00d7 (1/3) = 1/9\n\nAdding them up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which matches what I initially thought.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them directly say 4:2:2:1. However, some options combine these ratios differently. Let me see:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16, which is wrong because our ratio is 9+3+3+1=16, but the actual ratio is 4:2:2:1, which sums to 9 parts. So Option G is incorrect.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This suggests a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which is the ratio for a dihybrid cross where each gene is segregating twice, like AABb \u00d7 AaBb. That doesn't apply here since we're dealing with a single cross from a homozygous bird.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This could correspond to a scenario where the F2 generation has a different distribution, possibly due to errors in calculation.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 This implies zero plain red, which isn't correct because some birds will definitely have a plain red phenotype.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 This suggests a 4:4:4:4 ratio, which would mean each phenotype is equally likely, but according to our calculation, it's 4:2:2:1.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Again, unequal distribution.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Summing to 16, which is incorrect.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Again, unequal distribution.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match 4:2:2:1. But perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy. \n\nWait, in some cases, the order of dominance matters. In this case, C is dominant for pigment color, and B is dominant for body color. So, in the final phenotype, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it will display the most prominent phenotype. Otherwise, it may display a secondary phenotype based on which gene is lacking.\n\nHowever, since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio remains 4:2:2:1. Therefore, the correct answer shouldn't be any of the options except perhaps if the user made a typo in the options. But among the given options, the closest is Option G, but it's scaled incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as counting each bird's phenotype individually rather than grouping them by phenotype.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user considered the presence of the recessive allele in each gene separately, leading to a different ratio. For example, if each gene is considered independently, then the ratios would be 1/2 for pigment and 1/2 for body color, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not matching the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user considered the number of dominant vs. recessive alleles in each gene, leading to a different ratio. For pigment color, half the birds will have at least one dominant C allele, and half won't. Similarly for body color. But this still doesn't explain the 4:2:2:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that none of the options match exactly, but Option G provides the sum 9+3+3+1=16, which exceeds the total possible (as each bird has two alleles for each gene, but phenotypically, only four distinct phenotypes exist), it's unlikely to be the correct answer. Option D shows a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to a scenario where each gene segregates twice, like in a test cross, but that's not applicable here.\n\nTherefore, despite the discrepancy, the correct phenotypic ratio based on dominance is 4:2:2:1, which isn't listed. However, among the options, Option G is the only one that accounts for all four phenotypes, albeit with varying numbers. But since the sum is 16, which is impossible, it must be incorrect. Hence, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in interpreting the options.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's options are labeled A to J, with each option having a different ratio. The correct ratio is 4:2:2:1, which isn't present. However, perhaps I've misinterpreted the question. Maybe the user meant to ask about the F1 generation instead of F2, but the question clearly states F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent the ratio in terms of percentages, but that's not indicated.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll have to choose the closest option based on the possible interpretations. Since the user provided several options, and Option G sums to 16, which is higher than the maximum possible for two genes, it's incorrect. Option D suggests a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is typical for a trihybrid cross, not a dihybrid. Option E suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is similar to the dihybrid cross but scaled down. But according to my analysis, the correct ratio is 4:2:2:1, which isn't among the options. However, if forced to pick, perhaps Option G is the closest, even though it's scaled incorrectly. Alternatively, none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.\n\nUpon reflection, I think the best approach is to conclude that none of the options are correct based on the standard dihybrid cross expectation, but since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer was Option G, but it's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. Another angle: perhaps the user is considering the number of birds rather than the phenotypic ratio. For instance, if there are 16 birds, each phenotypic group would have a certain number. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven the options, and recognizing that none perfectly match the correct 4:2:2:1 ratio, perhaps the intended answer was Option G, but it's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I overlooked something in the dominance hierarchy. For instance, in the final phenotype, does the bird's genotype matter beyond the presence of dominant alleles? Or perhaps the user is considering the number of each phenotype based on the number of alleles, not the actual phenotype classification.\n\nIf we count the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, for each bird, the number of checkered and red colors would depend on the alleles. For example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C and one c, it's pigmented red, and if it has at least one B and one b, it's brown. So the phenotype is determined by both genes together, leading to 4:2:2:1.\n\nIf we count the number of each phenotype without focusing on dominance:\n\n- Checkered (cc) can come from CC (only one c) or cc (both c).\n- Red (C_) comes from CB or Cc.\n- Plain (cc) comes from cc.\n- Brown (B_) comes from CB or Bb.\n\nBut this doesn't change the phenotypic ratio; it's still 4:2:2",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nSo each bird can have one of four phenotypes. Now, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor Gene C:\n- Probability of C (dominant): 2/3 (since C is dominant over c, and each bird has two Cs)\nWait, no\u2014each bird has two copies of the C and c alleles. Wait, the bird itself has two alleles for each gene. So for Gene C, each bird has two alleles, either CC (p) or Cc (m). The proportion of each is 25% CC (p) and 75% Cc (m). Similarly for Gene B.\n\nBut when looking at the combined effect, the phenotypic ratios are determined by the additive effects of the two genes. However, in this case, since each gene is dominant-recessive, and the birds are heterozygous for both genes (since they're CcBB and ccbb), the phenotypes will follow a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but adjusted for the specific traits.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's for a monohybrid cross. For a dihybrid cross, it's a bit different because each gene is under separate dominance. Let me clarify: Each bird has two alleles for each gene. For Gene C, each bird has two alleles. The possible combinations are CC (p), Cc (m), and cc (n). Similarly for Gene B. Since the genes are independent, the phenotypes are combinations of these. The phenotypic ratios can be calculated by determining the probabilities of each combination.\n\nLet me construct a table:\n\nPhenotype | C Gene | B Gene\n--- | --- | ---\nRed Brown (C dominant, B dominant) | C (present) * B (present) = 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9\nRed Checkered (C present, B absent) | 2/3 * 1/3 = 2/9\nPlain Brown (C absent, B present) | 1/3 * 2/3 = 2/9\nPlain Checkered (C absent, B absent) | 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9\n\nSo the overall phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which sums up to 9 parts. But wait, the options given don't include 4:2:2:1. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me double-check.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. For Gene C: 25% CC, 50% Cc, 25% cc. For Gene B: same. Since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So:\n\n- All C and B (C dominant, B dominant) \u2192 (2/3)(2/3) = 4/9\n- C dominant, B recessive \u2192 (2/3)(1/3) = 2/9\n- C recessive, B dominant \u2192 (1/3)(2/3) = 2/9\n- C recessive, B recessive \u2192 (1/3)(1/3) = 1/9\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which simplifies to 4:2:2:1. Looking back at the options provided, none of them match exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOptions A to H provide various ratios. None seem to match 4:2:2:1 directly. Perhaps I misunderstood the question. Wait, the question asks for the F2 generation's phenotypic ratio, not the entire class. Also, the user provided a list of possible answers, and option G says 12:2:2:0, which doesn't align with my calculation. Option D is 1:3:9:3, which also doesn't fit. Maybe I need to consider something else.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of considering all possible combinations, perhaps the question is asking about the F2 generation after selfing once, starting from F1. But earlier, I thought that the F2 would be 25% each of the four phenotypes. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that contradicts the options. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as counting the number of each phenotype regardless of the exact count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the dominance rules. Let me reconsider:\n\n- For the pigment (C):\n  - C is dominant \u2192 red\n  - c is recessive \u2192 plain\n- For the body color (B):\n  - B is dominant \u2192 brown\n  - b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nNow, each bird has two alleles for each gene. So for each gene, the presence of the dominant allele leads to the corresponding color. So the phenotypes are combinations of these.\n\nThe total number of possible phenotypes without considering dominance would be 3\u00d73=9, but dominance reduces the number. However, in reality, each bird's phenotype is determined by whether each gene contributes a dominant or recessive allele. So:\n\n- If the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it'll have one phenotype.\n- If it lacks one dominant allele, it might have another phenotype depending on which gene is missing.\n\nThis complicates things. Perhaps I need to use a Punnett square approach for the dihybrid cross.\n\nGiven that the parents are CC BB (which is technically CcBB, but since both are dominant, it's effectively CC BB) and cc bb (which is cc bb).\n\nWhen crossing CC BB with cc bb, the F1 would be CcBb. Then, selfing the F1 to get F2.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the expected F2 phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but adjusted based on dominance. However, since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects us to count the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, considering the possible genotypes.\n\nWait, the options provided don't match my initial calculations. Let me try another approach: Maybe the user wants the ratio of each phenotype based on the actual counts produced by the Punnett square. Given that the F1 is CcBb, the F2 would be generated by selfing this bird.\n\nEach bird can produce gametes as follows:\n\n- From Cc: 50% C, 50% c\n- From Bb: 50% B, 50% b\n\nThus, the F2 would have the following possible genotypes:\n\n- CC BB (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- CC Bb (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- CC bb (from CB \u00d7 bb)\n- CC bb (from cb \u00d7 bb)\n- Cc BB (from cB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc Bb (from cB \u00d7 cb)\n- Cc bb (from cB \u00d7 bb)\n- Cc bb (from cb \u00d7 bb)\n- cc BB (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- cc Bb (from cb \u00d7 Bb)\n- cc bb (from cb \u00d7 bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. The correct way is to consider all combinations. Actually, each parent (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Thus, the F2 would have the following combinations:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cB \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- cB \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccBb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to systematically combine the gametes. The F2 will have four possible phenotypes, each derived from the combination of two gametes. Let's determine the phenotypes for each possible pair:\n\n1. CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb \u2192 Pigment red (C is dominant), Body brown (B is dominant) \u2192 Phenotype: Red Brown\n2. CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb \u2192 C dominant, B dominant \u2192 Red Brown\n3. CB \u00d7 cB: CcBb \u2192 Same \u2192 Red Brown\n4. CB \u00d7 cb: Same as above \u2192 Red Brown\n5. cb \u00d7 CB: Same as 1-4 \u2192 Red Brown\n6. cb \u00d7 cb: ccbb \u2192 Plain red (c is recessive), Plain body (b is recessive) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Red\n7. cb \u00d7 cB: ccBb \u2192 Plain red, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype: Plain Brown\n8. cb \u00d7 cb: Same as 6 \u2192 Plain Red\n9. cB \u00d7 CB: Same as 1-4 \u2192 Red Brown\n10. cB \u00d7 cb: ccBb \u2192 Plain red, Brown body \u2192 Plain Brown\n11. cB \u00d7 cB: ccBb \u2192 Same \u2192 Plain Brown\n12. cB \u00d7 cb: Same \u2192 Plain Brown\n13. cb \u00d7 CB: Same \u2192 Red Brown\n14. cb \u00d7 cb: Same \u2192 Plain Red\n15. cB \u00d7 cb: Same \u2192 Plain Brown\n16. cB \u00d7 cb: Same \u2192 Plain Brown\n17. cb \u00d7 cb: Same \u2192 Plain Red\n\nWait, this seems too long. Perhaps it's easier to note that each bird in F2 can be categorized into four phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. Let's do that:\n\n- Phenotype 1: Both genes have dominant alleles \u2192 Pigment red, Body brown\n- Phenotype 2: C dominant, B recessive \u2192 Pigment red, Body checkered\n- Phenotype 3: C recessive, B dominant \u2192 Pigment plain, Body brown\n- Phenotype 4: C recessive, B recessive \u2192 Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate how many of each phenotype occur in the F2 generation.\n\nSince each gene is independent, the probability of each phenotype is:\n\n- Phenotype 1: (Probability C dominant) \u00d7 (Probability B dominant) = (2/3) \u00d7 (2/3) = 4/9\n- Phenotype 2: (2/3) \u00d7 (1/3) = 2/9\n- Phenotype 3: (1/3) \u00d7 (2/3) = 2/9\n- Phenotype 4: (1/3) \u00d7 (1/3) = 1/9\n\nAdding them up: 4/9 + 2/9 + 2/9 + 1/9 = 9/9 = 1, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 4:2:2:1, which matches what I initially thought.\n\nLooking back at the options, none of them directly say 4:2:2:1. However, some options combine these ratios differently. Let me see:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Total 16, which is wrong because our ratio is 9+3+3+1=16, but the actual ratio is 4:2:2:1, which sums to 9 parts. So Option G is incorrect.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This suggests a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which is the ratio for a dihybrid cross where each gene is segregating twice, like AABb \u00d7 AaBb. That doesn't apply here since we're dealing with a single cross from a homozygous bird.\n\nOption E: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This could correspond to a scenario where the F2 generation has a different distribution, possibly due to errors in calculation.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 This implies zero plain red, which isn't correct because some birds will definitely have a plain red phenotype.\n\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 This suggests a 4:4:4:4 ratio, which would mean each phenotype is equally likely, but according to our calculation, it's 4:2:2:1.\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Again, unequal distribution.\n\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Summing to 16, which is incorrect.\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 Again, unequal distribution.\n\nHmm, none of the options perfectly match 4:2:2:1. But perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me re-examine the dominance hierarchy. \n\nWait, in some cases, the order of dominance matters. In this case, C is dominant for pigment color, and B is dominant for body color. So, in the final phenotype, if the bird has at least one dominant allele for both genes, it will display the most prominent phenotype. Otherwise, it may display a secondary phenotype based on which gene is lacking.\n\nHowever, since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratio remains 4:2:2:1. Therefore, the correct answer shouldn't be any of the options except perhaps if the user made a typo in the options. But among the given options, the closest is Option G, but it's scaled incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different approach, such as counting each bird's phenotype individually rather than grouping them by phenotype.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user considered the presence of the recessive allele in each gene separately, leading to a different ratio. For example, if each gene is considered independently, then the ratios would be 1/2 for pigment and 1/2 for body color, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not matching the options either.\n\nWait, perhaps the user considered the number of dominant vs. recessive alleles in each gene, leading to a different ratio. For pigment color, half the birds will have at least one dominant C allele, and half won't. Similarly for body color. But this still doesn't explain the 4:2:2:1 ratio.\n\nGiven that none of the options match exactly, but Option G provides the sum 9+3+3+1=16, which exceeds the total possible (as each bird has two alleles for each gene, but phenotypically, only four distinct phenotypes exist), it's unlikely to be the correct answer. Option D shows a ratio of 1:3:9:3, which corresponds to a scenario where each gene segregates twice, like in a test cross, but that's not applicable here.\n\nTherefore, despite the discrepancy, the correct phenotypic ratio based on dominance is 4:2:2:1, which isn't listed. However, among the options, Option G is the only one that accounts for all four phenotypes, albeit with varying numbers. But since the sum is 16, which is impossible, it must be incorrect. Hence, perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in interpreting the options.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's options are labeled A to J, with each option having a different ratio. The correct ratio is 4:2:2:1, which isn't present. However, perhaps I've misinterpreted the question. Maybe the user meant to ask about the F1 generation instead of F2, but the question clearly states F2. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent the ratio in terms of percentages, but that's not indicated.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll have to choose the closest option based on the possible interpretations. Since the user provided several options, and Option G sums to 16, which is higher than the maximum possible for two genes, it's incorrect. Option D suggests a 1:3:9:3 ratio, which is typical for a trihybrid cross, not a dihybrid. Option E suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio, which is similar to the dihybrid cross but scaled down. But according to my analysis, the correct ratio is 4:2:2:1, which isn't among the options. However, if forced to pick, perhaps Option G is the closest, even though it's scaled incorrectly. Alternatively, none of the options are correct, but that's unlikely.\n\nUpon reflection, I think the best approach is to conclude that none of the options are correct based on the standard dihybrid cross expectation, but since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer was Option G, but it's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the question. Another angle: perhaps the user is considering the number of birds rather than the phenotypic ratio. For instance, if there are 16 birds, each phenotypic group would have a certain number. But that's speculative.\n\nGiven the options, and recognizing that none perfectly match the correct 4:2:2:1 ratio, perhaps the intended answer was Option G, but it's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I overlooked something in the dominance hierarchy. For instance, in the final phenotype, does the bird's genotype matter beyond the presence of dominant alleles? Or perhaps the user is considering the number of each phenotype based on the number of alleles, not the actual phenotype classification.\n\nIf we count the number of each phenotype without considering dominance, for each bird, the number of checkered and red colors would depend on the alleles. For example:\n\n- If a bird has at least one C and one c, it's pigmented red, and if it has at least one B and one b, it's brown. So the phenotype is determined by both genes together, leading to 4:2:2:1.\n\nIf we count the number of each phenotype without focusing on dominance:\n\n- Checkered (cc) can come from CC (only one c) or cc (both c).\n- Red (C_) comes from CB or Cc.\n- Plain (cc) comes from cc.\n- Brown (B_) comes from CB or Bb.\n\nBut this doesn't change the phenotypic ratio; it's still 4:2:2",

So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each type of phenotype. The possible ratios are determined by the probabilities of each combination of alleles. Let's calculate the probabilities for each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (red) = 3/4 (since \u00be of the F2 have at least one dominant C)\n- Probability of c (plain) = \u00bc\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (checkered) = \u00bc\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities. Let's list the four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding up all probabilities: 9+3+3+1=16, so 16/16=1. That makes sense.\n\nNow, converting these fractions into counts based on a hypothetical total population, say 16 birds, the counts would be:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown: 9\n2. Pigment red, Checkered: 3\n3. Plain, Brown: 3\n4. Plain, Checkered: 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, matches\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't match exactly, but wait, our calculation was 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed as an option except for G, which says 12,2,2,0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me double-check the probabilities. For C: \u00be chance of C (red) and \u00bc for c (plain). Similarly for B: \u00be B, \u00bc b. The phenotypes are combinations of these.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the actual number of each phenotype depends on the number of birds and how many have each combination. For example, with a large number of F2 birds, the ratio would approach 9:3:3:1. If we consider the given options, option G says 12,2,2,0, which doesn't seem right because our calculation shows 9,3,3,1. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only the checkered phenotype as a separate category. Wait, but the options don't include 9:3:3:1, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of C and B without considering the exact count. Wait, looking back, the user didn't specify the total number of birds, but the options suggest specific counts. Maybe I need to recount based on the actual F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nParental F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (probability 25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\nNow, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C is dominant), Body checkered (B is recessive) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc BB: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, what's the frequency of each phenotype?\n\nEach of these four genotypes is equally likely, so each has a 25% chance.\n\nPhenotype 1: 25%\nPhenotype 2: 25%\nPhenotype 3: 25%\nPhenotype 4: 25%\n\nBut wait, this contradicts my earlier calculation where I considered the probabilities for each trait separately. Actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so each phenotype is a combination of both traits. Therefore, the four phenotypes should indeed be equally represented in the F2 generation. So, in terms of numbers, each phenotype would occur approximately 25% of the time. \n\nIf we assume a population size of 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\nPhenotype 1: 4\nPhenotype 2: 4\nPhenotype 3: 4\nPhenotype 4: 4\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. However, looking back at the options, option G says 12,2,2,0, which seems off. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't fit. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16, but the distribution doesn't align. Option J suggests 2,6,3,1, which doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. The user asked for the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the ratio based on the presence of both dominant traits rather than the exact counts. But that still wouldn't align with any of the given options except possibly option G, which is 12,2,2,0, but that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation. Let me re-examine the Punnett square provided in the user's message. They provided a detailed list of gametes and F1 generation, but perhaps they are not needed here since the question is about F2. In their F2 section, they list possible phenotypes and their counts:\n\nA. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nLooking at option G, the ratio is 12:2:2:0. That implies that 12 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 2 plain red, and 0 plain brown birds. Wait, but according to my calculations, all four phenotypes should appear in roughly equal numbers. So why does option G have zero plain brown?\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me go through each bird's phenotype based on their genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C is dominant), Body checkered (B is recessive) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc BB: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of the B allele (dominant) results in brown color, while the b allele (recessive) results in checkered. So regardless of the presence of C, if B is dominant, the bird is brown; if B is recessive, it's checkered. So the phenotypes are based on both genes. Thus, the four phenotypes are indeed equally likely, each occurring 25% of the time.\n\nTherefore, in a large enough sample, each phenotype should occur approximately the same number of times. But looking at the options, none of them directly state 4:4:4:4. However, option G has 12,2,2,0, which doesn't align with equal representation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio based on the number of checkered vs. plain in each trait, ignoring the other trait.\n\nWait, that might be the confusion. Let me clarify: The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, considering all four traits. So the correct ratio should account for both pigments and colors. Hence, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match that. However, option G has 12,2,2,0, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in providing the options, or I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is simplifying the scenario and not accounting for dominance properly. Perhaps the phenotypic ratio is being considered without considering dominance beyond what's given. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended for us to ignore the dominance aspect and treat both genes as independent, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but none of the options match that. Therefore, perhaps the closest answer is option G, which states 12,2,2,0, suggesting that checkered red is the most common, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, and plain brown is rare or absent. But according to our analysis, all four phenotypes should be equally represented, making option G unlikely.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best choice is option G, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in the probabilities. Let me recalculate the probabilities:\n\nFor each trait:\n\n- C (pigment): \u00be chance of red (dominant), \u00bc plain.\n- B (color): \u00be brown, \u00bc checkered.\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both C and B recessive: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, so 16/16=1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach could be to use the Punnett square for F2 and tally the phenotypes directly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird can be categorized based on their combination of C and B alleles:\n\n- For C: \u00be have at least one C (red), \u00bc have c (plain)\n- For B: \u00be have at least one B (brown), \u00bc have b (checkered)\n\nThe four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown): (\u00be)(\u00be) = 9/16\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): (\u00be)(\u00bc) = 3/16\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): (\u00bc)(\u00be) = 3/16\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): (\u00bc)(\u00bc) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the user intended a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to know the ratio of checkered to plain in each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within each trait, not overall. For instance, in the presence of pigment (C), the ratio of red to plain is 3:1. Similarly, for color (B), the ratio of brown to checkered is 3:1. But the question combines these traits, so it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended for us to ignore the dominance aspect and just look at the proportion of each phenotype, treating both genes as independent, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not accurate either.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that represents a balanced ratio, even though it doesn't match the 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended for us to consider only the presence of one trait, leading to option G (12:2:2:0), which might indicate that checkered is dominant in both traits, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Given that, perhaps the closest answer is option G, but I'm not entirely confident. However, based on standard Mendelian inheritance, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option G, despite the discrepancy.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the F2 generation will have a certain number of each type of phenotype. The possible ratios are determined by the probabilities of each combination of alleles. Let's calculate the probabilities for each trait separately and then combine them.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- Probability of C (red) = 3/4 (since \u00be of the F2 have at least one dominant C)\n- Probability of c (plain) = \u00bc\n\nFor the B locus:\n\n- Probability of B (brown) = 3/4\n- Probability of b (checkered) = \u00bc\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for each phenotype is the product of the individual probabilities. Let's list the four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding up all probabilities: 9+3+3+1=16, so 16/16=1. That makes sense.\n\nNow, converting these fractions into counts based on a hypothetical total population, say 16 birds, the counts would be:\n\n1. Pigment red, Brown: 9\n2. Pigment red, Checkered: 3\n3. Plain, Brown: 3\n4. Plain, Checkered: 1\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option G. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes, matches\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't match exactly, but wait, our calculation was 9:3:3:1, which isn't listed as an option except for G, which says 12,2,2,0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me double-check the probabilities. For C: \u00be chance of C (red) and \u00bc for c (plain). Similarly for B: \u00be B, \u00bc b. The phenotypes are combinations of these.\n\nBut wait, another approach: the actual number of each phenotype depends on the number of birds and how many have each combination. For example, with a large number of F2 birds, the ratio would approach 9:3:3:1. If we consider the given options, option G says 12,2,2,0, which doesn't seem right because our calculation shows 9,3,3,1. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only the checkered phenotype as a separate category. Wait, but the options don't include 9:3:3:1, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the presence of C and B without considering the exact count. Wait, looking back, the user didn't specify the total number of birds, but the options suggest specific counts. Maybe I need to recount based on the actual F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Let me try another approach. Using a Punnett square for the F2 generation:\n\nParental F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (probability 25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- cc BB (25%)\n- cc Bb (25%)\n\nNow, for each genotype, determine the phenotype:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C is dominant), Body checkered (B is recessive) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc BB: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nNow, what's the frequency of each phenotype?\n\nEach of these four genotypes is equally likely, so each has a 25% chance.\n\nPhenotype 1: 25%\nPhenotype 2: 25%\nPhenotype 3: 25%\nPhenotype 4: 25%\n\nBut wait, this contradicts my earlier calculation where I considered the probabilities for each trait separately. Actually, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes, so each phenotype is a combination of both traits. Therefore, the four phenotypes should indeed be equally represented in the F2 generation. So, in terms of numbers, each phenotype would occur approximately 25% of the time. \n\nIf we assume a population size of 16 birds, we'd expect:\n\nPhenotype 1: 4\nPhenotype 2: 4\nPhenotype 3: 4\nPhenotype 4: 4\n\nBut none of the options reflect this. However, looking back at the options, option G says 12,2,2,0, which seems off. Option H is 5,3,2,6, which also doesn't fit. Option A is 6,2,6,2, which sums to 16, but the distribution doesn't align. Option J suggests 2,6,3,1, which doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I've misunderstood the question. The user asked for the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the ratio based on the presence of both dominant traits rather than the exact counts. But that still wouldn't align with any of the given options except possibly option G, which is 12,2,2,0, but that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the F2 generation.

So why does option G have zero plain brown?\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypes. Let me go through each bird's phenotype based on their genotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: Pigment red (C is dominant), Body checkered (B is recessive) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC Bb: Pigment red, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc BB: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. cc Bb: Pigment plain, Body brown \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of the B allele (dominant) results in brown color, while the b allele (recessive) results in checkered. So regardless of the presence of C, if B is dominant, the bird is brown; if B is recessive, it's checkered. So the phenotypes are based on both genes. Thus, the four phenotypes are indeed equally likely, each occurring 25% of the time.\n\nTherefore, in a large enough sample, each phenotype should occur approximately the same number of times. But looking at the options, none of them directly state 4:4:4:4. However, option G has 12,2,2,0, which doesn't align with equal representation. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio based on the number of checkered vs. plain in each trait, ignoring the other trait.\n\nWait, that might be the confusion. Let me clarify: The question asks for the phenotypic ratio, considering all four traits. So the correct ratio should account for both pigments and colors. Hence, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but none of the options match that. However, option G has 12,2,2,0, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in providing the options, or I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe the question is simplifying the scenario and not accounting for dominance properly. Perhaps the phenotypic ratio is being considered without considering dominance beyond what's given. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended for us to ignore the dominance aspect and treat both genes as independent, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but none of the options match that. Therefore, perhaps the closest answer is option G, which states 12,2,2,0, suggesting that checkered red is the most common, followed by checkered brown, then plain red, and plain brown is rare or absent. But according to our analysis, all four phenotypes should be equally represented, making option G unlikely.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the best choice is option G, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation in the probabilities. Let me recalculate the probabilities:\n\nFor each trait:\n\n- C (pigment): \u00be chance of red (dominant), \u00bc plain.\n- B (color): \u00be brown, \u00bc checkered.\n\nThe combined probabilities for each phenotype are:\n\n1. Both C and B dominant: (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. C dominant, B recessive: (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. C recessive, B dominant: (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Both C and B recessive: (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nTotal: 9 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 16, so 16/16=1. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1. None of the options match this. However, option G is 12:2:2:0, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in presenting the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach could be to use the Punnett square for F2 and tally the phenotypes directly.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird can be categorized based on their combination of C and B alleles:\n\n- For C: \u00be have at least one C (red), \u00bc have c (plain)\n- For B: \u00be have at least one B (brown), \u00bc have b (checkered)\n\nThe four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown): (\u00be)(\u00be) = 9/16\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): (\u00be)(\u00bc) = 3/16\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): (\u00bc)(\u00be) = 3/16\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): (\u00bc)(\u00bc) = 1/16\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But since none of the options match this, perhaps the user intended a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants to know the ratio of checkered to plain in each trait.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the ratio within each trait, not overall. For instance, in the presence of pigment (C), the ratio of red to plain is 3:1. Similarly, for color (B), the ratio of brown to checkered is 3:1. But the question combines these traits, so it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended for us to ignore the dominance aspect and just look at the proportion of each phenotype, treating both genes as independent, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But that's not accurate either.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to select the option that represents a balanced ratio, even though it doesn't match the 9:3:3:1. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended for us to consider only the presence of one trait, leading to option G (12:2:2:0), which might indicate that checkered is dominant in both traits, but that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Given that, perhaps the closest answer is option G, but I'm not entirely confident. However, based on standard Mendelian inheritance, the correct ratio should be 9:3:3:1, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option G, despite the discrepancy.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

Let me calculate the actual phenotypic ratios. The F2 generation would have four possible genotypic combinations:\n\n1. CC BB: Checkered red\n2. CC Bb: Checkered brown\n3. cc BB: Plain red\n4. cc Bb: Plain brown\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because in the F2, the phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant or recessive. Let's consider each bird individually. For pigment color (C):\n\n- If any C allele is present (i.e., C_), the bird is Checkered red.\n- If c_ is present (i.e., cc_), the bird is Plain red.\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- If any B allele is present (i.e., B_), the bird is Brown.\n- If b_ is present (i.e., bb_), the bird is Checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes are combinations of these two traits. Let's list all possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_): Checkered red\n2. Pigment red (C_) and Checkered (b_): Plain red\n3. Pigment plain (cc_) and Brown (B_): Checkered brown\n4. Pigment plain (cc_) and Checkered (b_): Plain brown\n\nNow, what are the probabilities for each phenotype?\n\nEach bird's phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Since the genes are assorting independently, we can calculate the probability for each phenotype by multiplying the probabilities of each trait.\n\nFirst, for Pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of C_: 3/4 (since Cc has a 3/4 chance of being C_)\n- Probability of c_: 1/4 (since cc has a 1/4 chance of being c_)\n\nSimilarly, for Body color (B):\n\n- Probability of B_: 3/4 (since Bb has a 3/4 chance of being B_)\n- Probability of b_: 1/4 (since bb has a 1/4 chance of being b_)\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are products of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's compute each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red (C_ and B_):**\n   - P(C_) = 3/4\n   - P(B_) = 3/4\n   - Combined: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. **Plain red (c_ and B_):**\n   - P(c_) = 1/4\n   - P(B_) = 3/4\n   - Combined: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n3. **Checkered brown (C_ and b_):**\n   - P(C_) = 3/4\n   - P(b_) = 1/4\n   - Combined: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n4. **Plain brown (c_ and b_):**\n   - P(c_) = 1/4\n   - P(b_) = 1/4\n   - Combined: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding these up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the number of each phenotype type.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption G says: \"Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2192 That doesn't match our 9:3:3:1.

Wait, none of them exactly matches my calculation of 9:3:3:1. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I messed up the probabilities. Let's recalculate:\n\nFor Pigment color (C):\n- C_: 3/4 (since Cc has a 3/4 chance of being C_)\n- c_: 1/4\n\nBody color (B):\n- B_: 3/4 (since Bb has a 3/4 chance of being B_)\n- b_: 1/4\n\nCombined probabilities:\n\n1. Checkered red (C_ and B_):\n   - (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Plain red (c_ and B_):\n   - (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Checkered brown (C_ and b_):\n   - (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (c_ and b_):\n   - (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nYes, that adds up to 16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option J saying \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Wait, no, 9:3:3:1 isn't matching any of the options except possibly J, where the numbers are doubled.

Checkered red (C_ and B_):\n   - (3/4)*(3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. Plain red (c_ and B_):\n   - (1/4)*(3/4) = 3/16\n\n3. Checkered brown (C_ and b_):\n   - (3/4)*(1/4) = 3/16\n\n4. Plain brown (c_ and b_):\n   - (1/4)*(1/4) = 1/16\n\nYes, that adds up to 16 parts. So the ratio is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option J saying \"Checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\".

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nWait, but that's four possible phenotypes. However, some of these might overlap. For example, if a bird is red and brown, regardless of whether it's checkered or plain, it would look like a single phenotype. Similarly, if a bird is plain and brown, regardless of checkered or not, it looks like another phenotype.\n\nBut looking back at the options, the choices given don't include four phenotypes. Instead, the options list phenotypic ratios across specific categories. Looking at the options:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 Total 16, but according to a Punnett square, the F2 should have a certain number of individuals. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Again, adding up to 16. But perhaps the way the phenotypes are being counted is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the proportion of each phenotype rather than the absolute count, but the options provide counts, so probably looking for the actual counts.\n\nSo, let's calculate the expected phenotypic ratios. First, determine the genotypes of the F2 generation. As established earlier, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB: 25%\n- CC bb: 25%\n- cc BB: 25%\n- cc bb: 25%\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\nFor C locus:\n\n- If C is present (either dominant or recessive?), but wait, no: C is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red. So:\n\n- CC and Cc \u2192 red (since C is dominant)\n- cc \u2192 plain\n\nSimilarly, for B locus:\n\n- BB and Bb \u2192 brown\n- bb \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, each bird's phenotype depends on both C and B alleles.\n\nLet's make a table:\n\nBird Type | C Alleles | B Alleles | Phenotype\n--- | --- | --- | ---\nCC BB | C (present) | B (present) | red brown (checkered?) Wait, no. Wait, the colors are separate. The phenotype is determined by the combination of both traits. Wait, but the problem statement says:\n\n- Red color is controlled by C (dominant)\n- Brown color is controlled by B (dominant)\n- Plain color is recessive c\n- Checkered is recessive b\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me clarify:\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene, and the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. So:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - Dominant (C): red\n  - Recessive (c): plain\n- For body color (B):\n  - Dominant (B): brown\n  - Recessive (b): checkered\n\nBut the problem combines these into a single phenotype for each bird. Wait, perhaps the phenotype is determined by the interaction of both traits. For example, if the bird is red and brown, it's a particular phenotype, red-brown. If it's red and checkered, it's red-checkered. If it's plain and brown, plain-brown. If it's plain and checkered, plain-checkered.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red-Brown (both dominant)\n2. Red-Checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain-Brown (c dominant, B dominant)\n4. Plain-Checkered (c dominant, B recessive)\n\nNow, let's see how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nFrom the F2 genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB: Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Phenotype: Red-Brown\n- 25% CC bb: C dominant (red), B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: Red-Checkered\n- 25% cc BB: C recessive (plain), B dominant (brown) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain-Brown\n- 25% cc bb: C recessive (plain), B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain-Checkered\n\nWait, but hold on: For the C locus, CC and Cc are both red because C is dominant. Similarly, for B, BB and Bb are brown, and bb is checkered. Therefore, each bird's phenotype is determined by their combination of C and B alleles. So each bird contributes to only one phenotype based on both loci.\n\nGiven that, each of the four F2 genotypes maps directly to one phenotype:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Red-Brown\n- CC bb \u2192 Red-Checkered\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain-Brown\n- cc bb \u2192 Plain-Checkered\n\nSince each of these genotypes represents exactly one bird type, the number of birds in each phenotype is proportional to the number of individuals in each genotype.\n\nAssuming the F2 generation is produced from a selfing of F1 (which is CcBb), each F2 bird has a 25% chance of each genotype, leading to 25% of the population having each genotype. Therefore, each phenotype would have 25% of the F2 birds.\n\nHowever, looking at the options, none directly state 25%, but option H states checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 16 birds. Wait, but that seems inconsistent because F2 should have 25% in each category, so 4 categories with 25% each would sum to 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering the number of birds rather than percentages. Let's recalculate.\n\nIf each F2 bird has a 25% chance of being in each category, then:\n\n- Red-Brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds out of 16\n- Red-Checkered: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain-Brown: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n- Plain-Checkered: 25% \u2192 4 birds\n\nAdding up to 16 birds.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Sum is 5+3+2+6=16.\n\nThis matches our calculation where each phenotype is 25% of the population. Therefore, the correct answer should reflect that each phenotype is equally represented in the F2 generation.\n\nThus, the correct option is H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the F2 population will have each of these phenotypes in proportion to the product of the individual gene ratios. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence (red): 2/3 (since C is dominant over c, and the F1 is Cc)\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc, so the probability of having at least one dominant C is 2/3. Similarly, the probability of being plain (c c) is 1/3.\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence (brown): 2/3 (since B is dominant over b)\n- Absence (checkered): 1/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Both traits dominant (Red and Brown):\n   - Probability = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\n\n2. Pigment dominant, Checkered (Red and Checkered):\n   - Probability = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9\n\n3. Plain, Pigment Brown (Checkered and Brown):\n   - Probability = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9\n\n4. Plain, Checkered (Checkered and Checkered):\n   - Probability = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratios are 4:2:2:1, which correspond to 4 parts Red-Brown, 2 Red-Checkered, 2 Plain-Brown, and 1 Plain-Checkered. To express this as a ratio, it's 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Doesn't match\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 Close, but the sum is 16 instead of 4\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal, doesn't fit the calculation\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16, doesn't match\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nWait, none of them seem to exactly match 4:2:2:1. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are expressed differently. Let me recount:\n\nEach bird has two traits: pigment (C/B) and body color (B/b). So possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red, body brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red, body checkered (C dominant, b)\n3. Pigment plain, body brown (c, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain, body checkered (c, b)\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n1. 4/9\n2. 2/9\n3. 2/9\n4. 1/9\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1. None of the options perfectly match this. Looking again at option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 That sums to 12, which isn't matching. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Also doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the count rather than the ratio. If we consider each bird as a unit, then for 9 birds (since F2 has 3 x 3 = 9), the counts would be:\n\n- 4: 4 (Red-Brown)\n- 2: 2 (Red-Checkered)\n- 2: 2 (Plain-Brown)\n- 1: 1 (Plain-Checkered)\n\nBut looking at the options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 That adds up to 16, which is too high. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match our 4:2:2:1.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended is option H: 5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match. Or another approach might yield different results, such as considering the actual number of each genotype leading to each phenotype. Let me try constructing the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1: CC BB\nParent 2: cc bb\n\nF1: Cc BB (wait, no: CC BB crossed with cc bb would result in CcBb, right?)\n\nThen, F1 (CcBb) selfed. The possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body plain\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body checkered\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body plain\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nPhenotypically:\n\n1. Red-Pain: Pigment red, Body plain \u2192 25%\n2. Red-Checkered: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 25%\n3. Plain-Pain: Pigment plain, Body plain \u2192 25%\n4. Plain-Checkered: Pigment plain, Body checkered \u2192 25%\n\nSo the ratio is 25% for each. But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation's overall phenotypic distribution without splitting into percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the count of each phenotype. Assuming each bird contributes equally, the F2 would have 9 birds. Thus:\n\n- 4: Red-Pain (because 4/9)\n- 2: Red-Checkered (2/9)\n- 2: Plain-Pain (2/9)\n- 1: Plain-Checkered (1/9)\n\nBut the options don't include this exact breakdown. Alternatively, perhaps the user considered the entire F2 population, where each parent produces 3 x 3 = 9 birds, so 9 birds in total.\n\nIf that's the case, then the counts would be:\n\n- 4: Red-Pain\n- 2: Red-Checkered\n- 2: Plain-Pain\n- 1: Plain-Checkered\n\nWhich corresponds to option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 No, that's 2+6+3+1=12, which is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in counting. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is presented as 4:2:2:1, which would mean:\n\n- 4 parts: Red-Pain\n- 2 parts: Red-Checkered\n- 2 parts: Plain-Pain\n- 1 part: Plain-Checkered\n\nBut none of the options match this exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent the counts differently.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which suggests that perhaps some phenotypes are double-counted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user miscalculated the probabilities. Let me re-express the probabilities correctly.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant, so presence (red) is 2/3\n- Absence (plain) is 1/3\n\nFor the body color (B):\n\n- B is dominant, presence (brown) is 2/3\n- Absence (checkered) is 1/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n1. Both dominant: (2/3)*(2/3)=4/9 \u2192 4\n2. Pigment dominant, checkered: (2/3)*(1/3)=2/9 \u2192 2\n3. Plain, dominant: (1/3)*(2/3)=2/9 \u2192 2\n4. Plain, checkered: (1/3)*(1/3)=1/9 \u2192 1\n\nTotal parts: 4+2+2+1=9, which matches the 3x3 grid.\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1.\n\nNone of the options match this exactly, but looking at option J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 That sums to 12, which is inconsistent. Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't make sense. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16, also inconsistent. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers the actual number of each genotype, not the phenotype. So each bird contributes to the next generation. If F2 has 9 birds, how many of each phenotype?\n\nFrom above:\n\n- 4 birds with pigment red and body plain (Red-Pain)\n- 2 birds with pigment red and body checkered (Red-Checkered)\n- 2 birds with pigment plain and body plain (Plain-Pain)\n- 1 bird with pigment plain and body checkered (Plain-Checkered)\n\nSo the counts would be:\n\n- Red-Pain: 4\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Pain: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 1\n\nExpressed as a ratio, it's 4:2:2:1. The closest option is J, which states 2,6,3,1, but that's a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the numbers without considering the denominator, which would lead to option J being incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user included the entire population, including both parents and the F1, but that complicates things further. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in creating the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume the correct ratio is 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match exactly. However, upon closer inspection, option J seems to be the closest, but it doesn't align with the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use the F1 counts, but that leads to 6,2,6,2, which is option A. But that doesn't match the F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considered the actual number of each genotype in F2, which would be:\n\n- 4: CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, body brown\n- 2: Ccbb \u2192 Pigment red, body checkered\n- 2: ccBB \u2192 Pigment plain, body brown\n- 1: ccbb \u2192 Pigment plain, body checkered\n\nBut if we count phenotypically, that translates to:\n\n- 4: Red-Brown\n- 2: Red-Checkered\n- 2: Plain-Brown\n- 1: Plain-Checkered\n\nStill, none of the options match. Perhaps the user intended to represent the counts without considering the denominator, so option J: 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, but the actual count is 9. This discrepancy makes it unclear.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best choice is option J, but it's not accurate according to my analysis.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the F2 population will have each of these phenotypes in proportion to the product of the individual gene ratios. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence (red): 2/3 (since C is dominant over c, and the F1 is Cc)\nWait, no\u2014the F1 is Cc, so the probability of having at least one dominant C is 2/3. Similarly, the probability of being plain (c c) is 1/3.\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence (brown): 2/3 (since B is dominant over b)\n- Absence (checkered): 1/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the phenotypic ratios can be calculated as follows:\n\n1. Both traits dominant (Red and Brown):\n   - Probability = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9\n\n2. Pigment dominant, Checkered (Red and Checkered):\n   - Probability = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9\n\n3. Plain, Pigment Brown (Checkered and Brown):\n   - Probability = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9\n\n4. Plain, Checkered (Checkered and Checkered):\n   - Probability = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9\n\nTherefore, the expected phenotypic ratios are 4:2:2:1, which correspond to 4 parts Red-Brown, 2 Red-Checkered, 2 Plain-Brown, and 1 Plain-Checkered. To express this as a ratio, it's 4:2:2:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Doesn't match\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 Doesn't match\nC.9,3,3,1 \u2192 Close, but the sum is 16 instead of 4\nD.1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nE.3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nF.4,4,4,4 \u2192 All equal, doesn't fit the calculation\nG.12,2,2,0 \u2192 Sum is 16, doesn't match\nH.5,3,2,6 \u2192 Doesn't match\nI.7,5,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't match\nJ.2,6,3,1 \u2192 Doesn't match\n\nWait, none of them seem to exactly match 4:2:2:1.

Pigment plain, body checkered (c, b)\n\nThe probabilities are:\n\n1. 4/9\n2. 2/9\n3. 2/9\n4. 1/9\n\nSo the ratio is 4:2:2:1. None of the options perfectly match this.

The possible gametes are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red, Body plain\n- Cc: Pigment red, Body checkered\n- cc: Pigment plain, Body plain\n- bb: Pigment plain, Body checkered\n\nPhenotypically:\n\n1. Red-Pain: Pigment red, Body plain \u2192 25%\n2. Red-Checkered: Pigment red, Body checkered \u2192 25%\n3. Plain-Pain: Pigment plain, Body plain \u2192 25%\n4.

But since the options don't reflect this, perhaps the question is considering the F2 generation's overall phenotypic distribution without splitting into percentages. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the count of each phenotype. Assuming each bird contributes equally, the F2 would have 9 birds.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to represent the counts differently.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption J: 2,6,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 12, which suggests that perhaps some phenotypes are double-counted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user miscalculated the probabilities. Let me re-express the probabilities correctly.\n\nFor the pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant, so presence (red) is 2/3\n- Absence (plain) is 1/3\n\nFor the body color (B):\n\n- B is dominant, presence (brown) is 2/3\n- Absence (checkered) is 1/3\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\n1.

Option G: 12,2,2,0 \u2192 Doesn't make sense. Option E: 3,9,1,3 \u2192 Doesn't fit. Option C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Sum is 16, also inconsistent. Option D: 1,3,9,3 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nWait, perhaps the question considers the actual number of each genotype, not the phenotype. So each bird contributes to the next generation. If F2 has 9 birds, how many of each phenotype?\n\nFrom above:\n\n- 4 birds with pigment red and body plain (Red-Pain)\n- 2 birds with pigment red and body checkered (Red-Checkered)\n- 2 birds with pigment plain and body plain (Plain-Pain)\n- 1 bird with pigment plain and body checkered (Plain-Checkered)\n\nSo the counts would be:\n\n- Red-Pain: 4\n- Red-Checkered: 2\n- Plain-Pain: 2\n- Plain-Checkered: 1\n\nExpressed as a ratio, it's 4:2:2:1. The closest option is J, which states 2,6,3,1, but that's a different ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to list the numbers without considering the denominator, which would lead to option J being incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user included the entire population, including both parents and the F1, but that complicates things further. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in creating the options.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume the correct ratio is 4:2:2:1, but none of the options match exactly. However, upon closer inspection, option J seems to be the closest, but it doesn't align with the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to use the F1 counts, but that leads to 6,2,6,2, which is option A. But that doesn't match the F2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considered the actual number of each genotype in F2, which would be:\n\n- 4: CcBb \u2192 Pigment red, body brown\n- 2: Ccbb \u2192 Pigment red, body checkered\n- 2: ccBB \u2192 Pigment plain, body brown\n- 1: ccbb \u2192 Pigment plain, body checkered\n\nBut if we count phenotypically, that translates to:\n\n- 4: Red-Brown\n- 2: Red-Checkered\n- 2: Plain-Brown\n- 1: Plain-Checkered\n\nStill, none of the options match. Perhaps the user intended to represent the counts without considering the denominator, so option J: 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12, but the actual count is 9. This discrepancy makes it unclear.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best choice is option J, but it's not accurate according to my analysis.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Plain color (c) and brown (B dominant, c recessive)\n4. Plain color and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut wait, since each bird has two separate traits, the number of phenotypic classes depends on how many traits are expressed. For example, a bird could be red and brown (both dominant), red and checkered, plain and brown, or plain and checkered.\n\nNow, going back to the F2 cross. The F1 is CcBb. When F1 selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (homozygous red)\n- 25% Cc (heterozygous red)\n- 25% cc (homozygous plain)\n- 25% bb (homozygous brown)\n\nWait, but hold on\u2014no, because each parent contributes one allele. If F1 is CcBb, then each gamete can be CB, cb, cB, or cb, each with 25% probability. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- From CB gamete + CB: CC (pigment red)\n- CB + cb: Cc (pigment red)\n- CB + cB: Cc (pigment red)\n- CB + cb: Cc (pigment red)\n- Similarly for the other gametes:\n  - cb + CB: Cc (pigment red)\n  - cb + cb: cc (plain)\n  - cb + cB: cc (plain)\n  - cb + cb: cc (plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not correct. Actually, the F2 would include all possible combinations of the gametes. Let me make a table:\n\nParental Genotype: CcBb\n\nGametes produced: 25% CB, 25% cb, 25% cB, 25% cb\n\nEach gamete combines with another gamete to form F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CC (pigment red)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 Cc (pigment red)\n3. CB + cB \u2192 Cc (pigment red)\n4. CB + cb \u2192 Cc (pigment red)\n5. cb + CB \u2192 Cc (pigment red)\n6. cb + cb \u2192 cc (plain)\n7. cb + cB \u2192 cc (plain)\n8. cb + cb \u2192 cc (plain)\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- C (red) \u2192 pigment red\n- c (plain) \u2192 pigment plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B (brown) \u2192 brown\n- b (checkered) \u2192 checkered\n\nSince these genes are independent, the phenotypes combine the effects of both genes. So the F2 phenotypes will have the following combinations:\n\n1. CC \u00d7 B (red and brown) \u2192 red brown\n2. CC \u00d7 b (red and checkered) \u2192 red checkered\n3. Cc \u00d7 B (red and brown) \u2192 red brown\n4. Cc \u00d7 b (red and checkered) \u2192 red checkered\n5. cc \u00d7 B (plain and brown) \u2192 plain brown\n6. cc \u00d7 b (plain and checkered) \u2192 plain checkered\n\nNow, the question is about the phenotypic ratio in F2. Let's count the occurrences of each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: red brown \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 2: red checkered \u2192 25%\nPhenotype 3: red checkered \u2192 25%\nWait, no\u2014wait, looking back, some of these might overlap. Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the 8 F2 individuals:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 red brown\n- 50% Cc \u2192 red checkered\n- 25% cc \u2192 plain checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014because 25% CC is red brown, 25% Cc is red checkered, and 25% cc is plain checkered. So:\n\n- Red brown: 25%\n- Red checkered: 25% (from Cc \u00d7 B)\n- Plain checkered: 25% (from cc \u00d7 b)\n\nThat adds up to 75%, leaving 25% unaccounted for. Wait, that can't be right. Let me double-check the counts.\n\nActually, each of the 8 F2 individuals can be categorized as follows:\n\n1. 1/4 CC \u00d7 B \u2192 red brown\n2. 1/4 CC \u00d7 b \u2192 red checkered\n3. 1/4 Cc \u00d7 B \u2192 red brown\n4. 1/4 Cc \u00d7 b \u2192 red checkered\n5. 1/4 cc \u00d7 B \u2192 plain brown\n6. 1/4 cc \u00d7 b \u2192 plain checkered\n7. 1/4 cc \u00d7 B \u2192 plain brown\n8. 1/4 cc \u00d7 b \u2192 plain checkered\n\nWait, but that's 8 individuals. Let's list them:\n\n- Pheno 1: red brown (positions 1 & 3)\n- Pheno 2: red checkered (positions 2 & 4)\n- Pheno 3: plain checkered (positions 6 & 8)\n- Pheno 4: plain brown (positions 5 & 7)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's 8 individuals, each having a unique combination. So:\n\n- 2 individuals are red brown\n- 2 are red checkered\n- 2 are plain checkered\n- 2 are plain brown\n\nAdding up to 8, so the ratio is 2:2:2:2, or 1:1:1:1. That seems too simplistic, but given the calculations, that's correct. Alternatively, sometimes in Punnett squares, overlapping may occur, but in this case, each phenotype is represented equally.\n\nHowever, the options provided don't seem to match this directly. Let me look at the answer choices:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that doesn't align with what I got. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Not matching either. Option A has different numbers. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me approach it differently. Instead of counting the proportion of each genotype, I'll consider the possible phenotypic classes and calculate their ratios based on the number of combinations.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red Brown (R_B)\n2. Red Checkered (R_b)\n3. Plain Checkered (r_b)\n4. Plain Brown (r_B)\n\nTo find the ratio, I need to determine how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category.\n\nFrom the earlier breakdown:\n\n- Pheno 1: red brown \u2192 2 individuals (positions 1 & 3)\n- Pheno 2: red checkered \u2192 2 individuals (positions 2 & 4)\n- Pheno 3: plain checkered \u2192 2 individuals (positions 6 & 8)\n- Pheno 4: plain brown \u2192 2 individuals (positions 5 & 7)\n\nThis would imply a 2:2:2:2 ratio, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. However, none of the answer choices reflect this exact ratio. Let's check the answer options again:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 Red Brown, Checkered Red, Plain Red, Plain Brown\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nHmm, option F is 4,4,4,4\u2014which suggests all phenotypes are equally likely, which matches our calculation. So according to my analysis, the correct ratio is 4:4:4:4, which corresponds to option F. However, I initially thought the correct ratio was 2:2:2:2, which also leads to option F.\n\nWait, but looking back, I might have made an error in the Punnett square setup. Let me re-examine the F1 and F2 generations.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, and when selfed, the F2 should indeed have a 25% chance for each genotype, leading to four phenotypes each with 25% frequency. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which is what option F shows. So why did I think earlier that it was 2:2:2:2?\n\nAh, perhaps I confused the terms. In reality, each phenotype class has an equal number of individuals, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So the correct answer should be option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Let's check the answer options again:\n\nA. 6, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 Red Brown, Checkered Red, Plain Red, Plain Brown\nB. 8,4,0,4\nC.9,3,3,1\nD.1,3,9,3\nE.3,9,1,3\nF.4,4,4,4\nG.12,2,2,0\nH.5,3,2,6\n\nHmm, option F is 4,4,4,4\u2014which suggests all phenotypes are equally likely, which matches our calculation. So according to my analysis, the correct ratio is 4:4:4:4, which corresponds to option F. However, I initially thought the correct ratio was 2:2:2:2, which also leads to option F.\n\nWait, but looking back, I might have made an error in the Punnett square setup. Let me re-examine the F1 and F2 generations.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb, and when selfed, the F2 should indeed have a 25% chance for each genotype, leading to four phenotypes each with 25% frequency. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio should be 1:1:1:1, which is what option F shows. So why did I think earlier that it was 2:2:2:2?\n\nAh, perhaps I confused the terms. In reality, each phenotype class has an equal number of individuals, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. So the correct answer should be option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

Because each bird has two traits, each with two options, leading to 2\u00d72=4 possible combinations.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each gene contributes two traits, leading to 2^2 =4 phenotypes, but some phenotypes might overlap, leading to more phenotypes. Wait, no, if each gene has two traits, then indeed, the phenotypes would be four, unless some phenotypes are identical due to overlapping traits. Alternatively, maybe the phenotypic ratios are given in terms of counts across all four phenotypes.\n\nBut according to the user's options, the answers vary in how many phenotypes are present. For example, option A shows four phenotypes, while option D also shows four. Option J sums to 12, which suggests that the user might have considered all possible phenotypes, including those where both traits are present regardless of dominance, but without dominance, the phenotype would still be the same as the dominant trait.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it differently. The correct way to calculate phenotypic ratios is to consider all possible genotype combinations and determine the resulting phenotypes. Each bird's phenotype depends on whether the dominant alleles are present for each gene.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- If the bird has at least one dominant C allele (i.e., C_), it will exhibit red pigment.\n- If it lacks C (cc), it'll be plain.\n\nFor the B locus:\n- If the bird has at least one dominant B allele (i.e., B_), it'll express brown color.\n- If it lacks B (bb), it'll be checkered.\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these:\n1. Red (C_) + Brown (B_) \u2192 checkered red\n2. Red (C_) + Checkered (bb) \u2192 plain red\n3. Plain (cc) + Brown (B_) \u2192 checkered brown\n4. Plain (cc) + Checkered (bb) \u2192 plain brown\n\nSo, there are four phenotypes: checkered red, plain red, checkered brown, plain brown.\n\nNow, the user's options list various combinations of these phenotypes with different counts. To determine which option is correct, I need to calculate how often each phenotype appears in the F2 generation.\n\nThe F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross between two heterozygotes (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb), but wait, no\u2014that's not right. Actually, the parents are CcBB \u00d7 ccbb. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb). The F1 would be all CcBb, and the F2 would come from crossing F1 with itself.\n\nEach gene acts independently, so the F2 phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each gene's expression.\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Probability of C_: 3/4\n- Probability of cc: 1/4\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Probability of B_: 3/4\n- Probability of bb: 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probability for any combination is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's tabulate the possible combinations:\n\n1. C_ (Red) and B_ (Brown) \u2192 checkered red\n   - Probability: (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. C_ (Red) and bb (Checkered) \u2192 plain red\n   - Probability: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. cc (Plain) and B_ (Brown) \u2192 checkered brown\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. cc (Plain) and bb (Checkered) \u2192 plain brown\n   - Probability: (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, converting these probabilities into actual counts, assuming a large number of F2 individuals, say 16 (to make the math easy):\n\n- checkered red: 9\n- plain red: 3\n- checkered brown: 3\n- plain brown: 1\n\nThis adds up to 16, matching the denominator in some of the answer choices. Looking at the options, choice G says \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2\" \u2014 that doesn't match our calculation. Choice H says \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6.\" That also doesn't match. Choice E has 3 checkered red, 9 plain red, etc.\u2014that matches our count. Wait, in my calculation, checkered red is 9, plain red is 3, checkered brown is 3, plain brown is 1. But none of the options perfectly match this. Let me see the options again.\n\nLooking back, option J sums to 12, which isn't relevant. Option E states \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3,\" which matches exactly what I have except that in our calculation, checkered red is 9 and plain red is 3, not the other way around. Wait, in option E, checkered red is 3 and checkered brown is 9, which would imply that the probabilities were reversed. That seems incorrect. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dominance. Let me double-check. For pigment color (C), dominant C leads to red, recessive c leads to plain. For body color (B), dominant B leads to brown, recessive b leads to checkered. So the phenotypes are indeed as I listed before.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question asks for phenotypic ratios across all four phenotypes, treating cases where multiple traits are expressed as a single phenotype. But in this case, each bird exhibits exactly one phenotype based on both genes. Therefore, the four phenotypes are distinct.\n\nWait, another angle: Maybe the user considers that both traits are expressed even if only one is dominant. In that case, for example, a bird with C and B would display both traits, making the phenotype appear as a blend rather than separate. But typically, in genetics, each trait is expressed separately unless stated otherwise. So I think the initial calculation holds.\n\nGiven that, the correct phenotype distribution is 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to the options. But looking at the options provided:\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This has the checkered red and checkered brown flipped compared to our calculation.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the question asks about the F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, and when crossed with itself, the F2 would have four possible genotypes: CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, and cc bb. But wait, that's only four. Alternatively, considering that F1 is CcBb, and when selfed, the possible genotypes for each gene are:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- From CB gamete: C\n- From cb gamete: c\nSo the phenotypes for C are either red (C present) or plain (c).\n\nSimilarly for B (body color):\n- From CB gamete: B\n- From cb gamete: b\nPhenotypes for B are either brown (B present) or checkered (b present).\n\nSince the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by calculating the probability of each combination.\n\nThe possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C present and B present \u2192 red and brown\n2. C present and B absent \u2192 red and checkered\n3. C absent and B present \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Both C absent and B absent \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nEach combination has a certain probability based on the independent assortment. Let's calculate the probabilities for each phenotype.\n\nFirst, for the C gene:\n- Probability of C present (C_: \u00be) = \u00be\n- Probability of c present (c_: \u00bc) = \u00bc\n\nFor the B gene:\n- Probability of B present (B_: \u00be) = \u00be\n- Probability of b present (b_: \u00bc) = \u00bc\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nLet's list all possible combinations:\n\n1. C_ (\u00be) AND B_ (\u00be) \u2192 red and brown\nProbability: \u00be * \u00be = 9/16\n\n2. C_ (\u00be) AND b_ (\u00bc) \u2192 red and checkered\nProbability: \u00be * \u00bc = 3/16\n\n3. c_ (\u00bc) AND B_ (\u00be) \u2192 plain and brown\nProbability: \u00bc * \u00be = 3/16\n\n4. c_ (\u00bc) AND b_ (\u00bc) \u2192 plain and checkered\nProbability: \u00bc * \u00bc = 1/16\n\nWait, but this seems off because adding up the probabilities: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. But looking back at the options provided, none seem to match exactly. However, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic ratios. Alternatively, maybe the question expects us to consider the number of each phenotype rather than the exact probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, given a certain population size. But without knowing the starting population size, it's hard to determine the exact counts. However, the question doesn't provide that detail, so perhaps we're supposed to look at the theoretical distribution.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16, which matches our calculation.\n\nBut another approach is to count the number of each phenotype based on the possible genotypes.\n\nIn F2:\n\n- CC BB: All red and brown \u2192 1 phenotype\n- CC bb: All red and checkered \u2192 1 phenotype\n- cc BB: All plain and brown \u2192 1 phenotype\n- cc bb: All plain and checkered \u2192 1 phenotype\n\nNow, how many of each genotype do we expect?\n\nFrom the Punnett square, each F2 generation consists of four types of birds:\n\n1. CC BB: 25%\n2. CC bb: 25%\n3. cc BB: 25%\n4. cc bb: 25%\n\nHowever, some of these may combine into the same phenotype. Wait, no\u2014each bird's phenotype depends on both traits, so each type contributes to different phenotypes. Let's see:\n\n- CC BB: red and brown (phenotype A)\n- CC bb: red and checkered (phenotype B)\n- cc BB: plain and brown (phenotype C)\n- cc bb: plain and checkered (phenotype D)\n\nTherefore, each of these four genotypes corresponds to a unique phenotype. Thus, in terms of counts, each phenotype would occur at 25% frequency. If we assume a sample size of 16 (to make numbers whole), then:\n\n- Phenotype A: 4 (25% of 16)\n- Phenotype B: 4\n- Phenotype C: 4\n- Phenotype D: 4\n\nBut the options don't have 4 for any. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking back, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Summing to 16, which matches our earlier calculation. So the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:3:9:3. But wait, that's similar to a binomial expansion where (R + r)^2 gives 1:2:1, but here we're dealing with two traits, leading to 1:3:9:3.\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be checkered red : checkered brown : plain red : plain brown = 1 : 3 : 9 : 3, which corresponds to option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let's calculate the frequency for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red**: Both C and B are present.\n   - Probability = (Probability C is present) * (Probability B is present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. **Plain red**: C present, B absent.\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. **Checkered brown**: C absent, B present.\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. **Plain brown**: C and B absent.\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nSo the phenotypes are fourfold, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1, but scaled according to the actual counts. Alternatively, since each gene has a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive), but since they're linked, but in reality, the genes might assort independently. Wait, but in this case, the parents are homozygous, so no linkage. Let me clarify: the F2 generation comes from F1 crossed with F1, where F1 is CcBb. So the F2 genotypes will be CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for B: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). But since the genes are independent, the combined phenotypes are calculated by multiplying the probabilities for each gene.\n\nWait, but in terms of phenotypic ratios, each gene contributes a certain number of phenotypes. Let me approach this differently. For each bird, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant): Checkered red\n- Pigment red (C dominant) and checkered (B recessive): Plain red\n- Pigment plain (C recessive) and brown (B dominant): Checkered brown\n- Pigment plain (C recessive) and checkered (B recessive): Plain brown\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the combinations of the alleles from each gene. Since each gene is independently inherited, the probabilities multiply. Let's calculate the frequency for each phenotype:\n\n1. **Checkered red**: Both C and B are present.\n   - Probability = (Probability C is present) * (Probability B is present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\n\n2. **Plain red**: C present, B absent.\n   - Probability = (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16\n\n3. **Checkered brown**: C absent, B present.\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16\n\n4. **Plain brown**: C and B absent.\n   - Probability = (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16, which checks out. So the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to Checkered red : Plain red : Checkered brown : Plain brown. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nLooking at option D: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\"\n\nWait, that doesn't match our calculation. Our ratio is 9:3:3:1, which translates to 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 checkered brown, and 1 plain brown. None of the options directly reflect 9:3:3:1. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption G says: \"checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\" \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption H: \"checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\" \u2192 No.\n\nOption A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption B: 8,4,0,4 \u2192 No.\n\nOption C: 9,3,3,1 \u2192 Yes!

C absent and B present:\n   - P(C absent) = 1/4\n   - P(B present) = 3/4\n   - Combined probability = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Both C absent and B absent:\n   - P(C absent) = 1/4\n   - P(B absent) = 1/4\n   - Combined probability = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nWait, but that adds up to 9+3+3+1 = 16, which is correct. So now, translating these probabilities into actual counts in a class of 16 birds:\n\n- 9 red and brown\n- 3 red and checkered\n- 3 plain and brown\n- 1 plain and checkered\n\nBut looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the colors are determined separately. So for each bird, the phenotype depends on both genes. Therefore, the number of phenotypic categories would be 2\u00d72=4, each being a combination of the two traits. Now, calculating the phenotypic ratio:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence (C): dominant (red)\n- Absence (c): plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the probabilities of each gene. Let's calculate the probabilities for each gene first.\n\nFor the C locus (p = frequency of C):\nSince Parent 1 is CC BB, the gametes produced are all CB. So Parent 1 is homozygous dominant, so p = 1, q = 0. Therefore, for C:\n- Probability of C = 1 (100%)\n- Probability of c = 0 (0%)\n\nFor the B locus (q = frequency of B):\nParent 2 is cc bb, so all gametes are cb. Therefore, Parent 2 is homozygous recessive, so q = 1 (100%), p = 0 (0%).\n\nWait, but that seems off because typically, in such cases, if both parents are homozygous, the F1 would be the heterozygote, but here Parent 1 is homozygous dominant (for C) and Parent 2 is homozygous recessive (for B). That might lead to different results. Let me double-check. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (so both alleles for C are dominant, and both alleles for B are dominant)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (so both alleles for C are recessive, and both alleles for B are recessive)\n\nWhen they mate, the F1 would be Cc BB (since Parent 1 can't pass c to F1 because Parent 1 is CC BB; thus, F1 gets C from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only contribute c and b. Therefore, the F1 would be Cc (from C + c) and Bb (from B + b)? Wait, no, wait. Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only contribute c and b. So F1 would be Cc (from C + c) and Bb (from B + b). Wait, but that doesn\u2019t seem right because Parent 1 cannot produce a c allele. Wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only produce gametes CB. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only produce gametes cb. Thus, F1 would be Cc BB and cb bb? Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross. Let me clarify.\n\nThe cross is between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb) bird. So, each bird produces gametes based on their own alleles. The F1 would get one allele from each parent. From Parent 1 (CC BB), the gametes are CB. From Parent 2 (cc bb), the gametes are cb. Therefore, F1 is CcBb. Now, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would consist of the following gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut now, applying the dominance rules to each gene:\n\nFor C:\n- C is dominant \u2192 Pigment red\n- c is recessive \u2192 Plain\n\nFor B:\n- B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n- b is recessive \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype for each bird is determined by whether it has the dominant alleles for both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (C dominant, so red) and B dominant (B dominant, so brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC (red) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc (plain) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. cc (plain) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these four genotypes has a 25% chance. Now, to find the phenotypic ratio, we look at how many of each phenotype occur:\n\nPhenotype 1: 25%\nPhenotype 2: 25%\nPhenotype 3: 25%\nPhenotype 4: 25%\n\nThus, all four phenotypes are equally likely. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Total 16 birds, but our calculation suggests 4 phenotypes each at 25%, totaling 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate. Maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves counting actual birds rather than theoretical probabilities. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. For the C locus:\n\n- Parent 1: Always provides C\n- Parent 2: Always provides c\n\nThus, F1 always receives C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, making Cc. For the B locus:\n\n- Parent 1: Always provides B\n- Parent 2: Always provides b\n\nThus, F1 always receives B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, making Bb. Therefore, F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these four phenotypes is equally likely, occurring at 25% each. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but looking at the options, none of them reflect this. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in reality, some birds may not express all traits. For example, a bird with CcBb could potentially have only pigment red and brown if they also exhibit checkered, but I don't think that's the case here. Each bird is expressed based on both genes, so each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16, matching the F2 population. However, my calculation suggested a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This discrepancy suggests I might have misunderstood the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dihybrid cross isn't between two parents but within a single bird. Let me read the original problem again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! So each bird has two traits: pigment (C/B) and color (B/b). The coat color is determined by the B gene, and the pigment color is determined by the C gene. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of these two traits.\n\nIn that case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C dominant) and checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c recessive) and checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the options provided do not include this exact ratio. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing these gives 16 birds, which matches the F2 population. But my calculation shows 4 phenotypes each at 25%, which is 4:4:4:4, summing to 16.\n\nThis suggests either I made a mistake, or perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual number of birds rather than percentages. If each bird is represented once, then the phenotypic distribution would indeed be 4 equal parts. But looking at the options, none directly match. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That sums to 16 birds as well. In this scenario, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:0.25:0.75, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I need to count the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nLet me reconsider. The F1 is CcBb, which when selfed, produces four possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014if Parent 1 is Cc and Parent 2 is Bb, then the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing. The F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% BB (from cb x cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are computed by considering all possible gamete combinations. The correct way is to create a Punnett square where each F1 gamete combines with each F1 gamete. But since F1 is CcBb, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% BB (from cb x cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014this can't be right because F1 is CcBb, so the gametes are CB, cb, cb, cb. Therefore, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% (CB x CB) \u2192 CC BB\n- 25% (CB x cb) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x CB) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x cb) \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because F1 is CcBb, the gametes are CB, cb, cb, cb. So when F1 (CcBb) mates with itself:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nThe Punnett square would involve all possible combinations:\n\nFrom the C locus: C can combine with C or c.\nFrom the B locus: B can combine with B or b.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each F1 gamete is combined with every other F1 gamete. Actually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- 25% (CB x CB) \u2192 CC BB\n- 25% (CB x cb) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x CB) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x cb) \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut wait, that only accounts for four combinations. I must have missed some. Actually, each F1 gamete is CB, cb, cb, cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but this still only accounts for four combinations, which can't be right because each parent produces four gametes, resulting in 16 possible combinations. So I must have made a mistake. Correctly, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, that's nine possibilities, each at 25%? No, that can't be because each parent has four gametes, leading to 16 combinations, but due to the dominance, some genotypes are the same. Let me recount:\n\nEach F1 gamete is CB, cb, cb, cb. So the F2 genotypes are formed by pairing each F1 gamete with every other F1 gamete.\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut this only accounts for four genotypes, each at 25% occurrence. However, when considering the actual F2 population, the counts would be higher because each gamete pair contributes to the next generation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me switch approaches. Instead of focusing on the Punnett square, I'll compute the number of each phenotype based on the dominance rules.\n\nGiven that F2 is CcBb, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (25%)\n- cc (25%)\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (25%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, applying the dominance rules:\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant \u2192 any bird with at least one C allele will be red.\n- Color brown (B) is dominant \u2192 any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes depend on both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. Cc (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. Cc (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n9. cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 instances\n- Phenotype B: Cases 3, 6 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype C: Cases 7, 8 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype D: Case 9 \u2192 1 instance\n\nWait, that totals 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 instances, but F2 should have 16 birds. Hmm, perhaps I've miscounted. Alternatively, perhaps each genotype represents a certain proportion, but in terms of actual birds, each genotype might correspond to a certain number of phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each bird is expressed based on both genes. For example, a bird with C and B will be Pigment red and brown, regardless of other alleles. So each bird falls into one of four categories:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, to find the number of each phenotype, I need to determine how many of the F2 birds fall into each category. Given that F2 is 1/16 for each genotype, but the phenotypes are dependent on both genes, the actual numbers might differ.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact genotype frequencies, it's challenging to determine the exact number of each phenotype. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes a Mendelian dihybrid cross where each phenotype is equally likely, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this contradicts the given answer choices, which suggest different ratios.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended approach is to recognize that each gene acts independently, leading to four phenotypes each at 25% frequency, hence a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the options don't include this. Looking back at the options, option H states: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Adding these gives 5+3+2+",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the colors are determined separately. So for each bird, the phenotype depends on both genes. Therefore, the number of phenotypic categories would be 2\u00d72=4, each being a combination of the two traits. Now, calculating the phenotypic ratio:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- Presence (C): dominant (red)\n- Absence (c): plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- Presence (B): brown\n- Absence (b): checkered\n\nTherefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nNow, the probability of each phenotype depends on the probabilities of each gene. Let's calculate the probabilities for each gene first.\n\nFor the C locus (p = frequency of C):\nSince Parent 1 is CC BB, the gametes produced are all CB. So Parent 1 is homozygous dominant, so p = 1, q = 0. Therefore, for C:\n- Probability of C = 1 (100%)\n- Probability of c = 0 (0%)\n\nFor the B locus (q = frequency of B):\nParent 2 is cc bb, so all gametes are cb. Therefore, Parent 2 is homozygous recessive, so q = 1 (100%), p = 0 (0%).\n\nWait, but that seems off because typically, in such cases, if both parents are homozygous, the F1 would be the heterozygote, but here Parent 1 is homozygous dominant (for C) and Parent 2 is homozygous recessive (for B). That might lead to different results. Let me double-check. The parents are:\n\n- Parent 1: CC BB (so both alleles for C are dominant, and both alleles for B are dominant)\n- Parent 2: cc bb (so both alleles for C are recessive, and both alleles for B are recessive)\n\nWhen they mate, the F1 would be Cc BB (since Parent 1 can't pass c to F1 because Parent 1 is CC BB; thus, F1 gets C from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2). Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only contribute c and b. Therefore, the F1 would be Cc (from C + c) and Bb (from B + b)? Wait, no, wait. Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only contribute C and B. Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only contribute c and b. So F1 would be Cc (from C + c) and Bb (from B + b). Wait, but that doesn\u2019t seem right because Parent 1 cannot produce a c allele. Wait, Parent 1 is CC BB, so it can only produce gametes CB. Similarly, Parent 2 is cc bb, so it can only produce gametes cb. Thus, F1 would be Cc BB and cb bb? Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross. Let me clarify.\n\nThe cross is between a homozygous dominant (CC BB) and a homozygous recessive (cc bb) bird. So, each bird produces gametes based on their own alleles. The F1 would get one allele from each parent. From Parent 1 (CC BB), the gametes are CB. From Parent 2 (cc bb), the gametes are cb. Therefore, F1 is CcBb. Now, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 would consist of the following gametes: CB and cb, each at 50% frequency. Therefore, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut now, applying the dominance rules to each gene:\n\nFor C:\n- C is dominant \u2192 Pigment red\n- c is recessive \u2192 Plain\n\nFor B:\n- B is dominant \u2192 Brown\n- b is recessive \u2192 Checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype for each bird is determined by whether it has the dominant alleles for both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and determine their phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (C dominant, so red) and B dominant (B dominant, so brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. CC (red) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. cc (plain) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Pigment plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. cc (plain) and b recessive (checkered) \u2192 Pigment plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these four genotypes has a 25% chance. Now, to find the phenotypic ratio, we look at how many of each phenotype occur:\n\nPhenotype 1: 25%\nPhenotype 2: 25%\nPhenotype 3: 25%\nPhenotype 4: 25%\n\nThus, all four phenotypes are equally likely. However, looking back at the options provided, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. 6 checkered red, 2 checkered brown, 6 plain red, 2 plain brown \u2192 Total 16 birds, but our calculation suggests 4 phenotypes each at 25%, totaling 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate. Maybe I misapplied the dominance rules. Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves counting actual birds rather than theoretical probabilities. Let me try another approach.\n\nEach parent contributes one allele for each gene. For the C locus:\n\n- Parent 1: Always provides C\n- Parent 2: Always provides c\n\nThus, F1 always receives C from Parent 1 and c from Parent 2, making Cc. For the B locus:\n\n- Parent 1: Always provides B\n- Parent 2: Always provides b\n\nThus, F1 always receives B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, making Bb. Therefore, F1 is CcBb.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, the possible gametes are CB and cb. So F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, applying dominance:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- Plain (c) and brown (B) \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- Plain (c) and checkered (b) \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nEach of these four phenotypes is equally likely, occurring at 25% each. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but looking at the options, none of them reflect this. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that in reality, some birds may not express all traits. For example, a bird with CcBb could potentially have only pigment red and brown if they also exhibit checkered, but I don't think that's the case here. Each bird is expressed based on both genes, so each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H says: Phenotypic ratio checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That adds up to 5+3+2+6=16, matching the F2 population. However, my calculation suggested a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This discrepancy suggests I might have misunderstood the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the dihybrid cross isn't between two parents but within a single bird. Let me read the original problem again: \"The checkered pattern of pigeons is controlled by a dominant gene C; plain color is determined by the recessive allele c. Red color is controlled by a dominant gene B, and brown color by the recessive allele b.\"\n\nAh! So each bird has two traits: pigment (C/B) and color (B/b). The coat color is determined by the B gene, and the pigment color is determined by the C gene. So each bird's phenotype is a combination of these two traits.\n\nIn that case, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red (C dominant) and checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain (c recessive) and brown (B dominant) \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain (c recessive) and checkered (b recessive) \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the options provided do not include this exact ratio. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Summing these gives 16 birds, which matches the F2 population. But my calculation shows 4 phenotypes each at 25%, which is 4:4:4:4, summing to 16.\n\nThis suggests either I made a mistake, or perhaps the question expects us to consider the actual number of birds rather than percentages. If each bird is represented once, then the phenotypic distribution would indeed be 4 equal parts. But looking at the options, none directly match. Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That sums to 16 birds as well. In this scenario, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:9:1:3, which simplifies to 1:3:0.25:0.75, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I need to count the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nLet me reconsider. The F1 is CcBb, which when selfed, produces four possible gametes: CB, cb, cb, cb. Wait, no\u2014if Parent 1 is Cc and Parent 2 is Bb, then the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from selfing. The F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% BB (from cb x cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 genotypes are computed by considering all possible gamete combinations. The correct way is to create a Punnett square where each F1 gamete combines with each F1 gamete. But since F1 is CcBb, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB x CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB x cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb x cb)\n- 25% BB (from cb x cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014this can't be right because F1 is CcBb, so the gametes are CB, cb, cb, cb. Therefore, the F2 would have:\n\n- 25% (CB x CB) \u2192 CC BB\n- 25% (CB x cb) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x CB) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x cb) \u2192 cc bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Because F1 is CcBb, the gametes are CB, cb, cb, cb. So when F1 (CcBb) mates with itself:\n\n- CcBb \u00d7 CcBb\n\nThe Punnett square would involve all possible combinations:\n\nFrom the C locus: C can combine with C or c.\nFrom the B locus: B can combine with B or b.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (25%)\n- CC Bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- CC bb (25%)\n- Cc BB (25%)\n- Cc Bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n- Cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each F1 gamete is combined with every other F1 gamete. Actually, the correct breakdown is:\n\n- 25% (CB x CB) \u2192 CC BB\n- 25% (CB x cb) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x CB) \u2192 Cc Bb\n- 25% (cb x cb) \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut wait, that only accounts for four combinations. I must have missed some. Actually, each F1 gamete is CB, cb, cb, cb. So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb (25%)\n\nWait, but this still only accounts for four combinations, which can't be right because each parent produces four gametes, resulting in 16 possible combinations. So I must have made a mistake. Correctly, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% Cc BB\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% Cc Bb\n- 25% cc Bb\n- 25% CC bb\n- 25% Cc bb\n- 25% cc bb\n\nWait, that's nine possibilities, each at 25%? No, that can't be because each parent has four gametes, leading to 16 combinations, but due to the dominance, some genotypes are the same. Let me recount:\n\nEach F1 gamete is CB, cb, cb, cb. So the F2 genotypes are formed by pairing each F1 gamete with every other F1 gamete.\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 Cc Bb\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 cc bb\n\nBut this only accounts for four genotypes, each at 25% occurrence. However, when considering the actual F2 population, the counts would be higher because each gamete pair contributes to the next generation.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me switch approaches. Instead of focusing on the Punnett square, I'll compute the number of each phenotype based on the dominance rules.\n\nGiven that F2 is CcBb, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (25%)\n- cc (25%)\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (25%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, applying the dominance rules:\n\n- Pigment red (C) is dominant \u2192 any bird with at least one C allele will be red.\n- Color brown (B) is dominant \u2192 any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.\n\nSo, the phenotypes depend on both genes. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. CC (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n3. CC (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n4. Cc (red) and BB (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n5. Cc (red) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n6. Cc (red) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n7. cc (plain) and BB (brown) \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n8. cc (plain) and Bb (brown) \u2192 Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n9. cc (plain) and bb (checkered) \u2192 Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, counting the number of each phenotype:\n\n- Phenotype A: Cases 1, 2, 4, 5 \u2192 4 instances\n- Phenotype B: Cases 3, 6 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype C: Cases 7, 8 \u2192 2 instances\n- Phenotype D: Case 9 \u2192 1 instance\n\nWait, that totals 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9 instances, but F2 should have 16 birds. Hmm, perhaps I've miscounted. Alternatively, perhaps each genotype represents a certain proportion, but in terms of actual birds, each genotype might correspond to a certain number of phenotypes based on dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each bird is expressed based on both genes. For example, a bird with C and B will be Pigment red and brown, regardless of other alleles. So each bird falls into one of four categories:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red and checkered \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Plain and brown \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Plain and checkered \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nNow, to find the number of each phenotype, I need to determine how many of the F2 birds fall into each category. Given that F2 is 1/16 for each genotype, but the phenotypes are dependent on both genes, the actual numbers might differ.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact genotype frequencies, it's challenging to determine the exact number of each phenotype. Therefore, perhaps the problem assumes a Mendelian dihybrid cross where each phenotype is equally likely, giving a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But this contradicts the given answer choices, which suggest different ratios.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended approach is to recognize that each gene acts independently, leading to four phenotypes each at 25% frequency, hence a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, the options don't include this. Looking back at the options, option H states: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Adding these gives 5+3+2+",

    "chunk_removed": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nBut wait, the way the problem is structured, each bird is described by two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (c/b). So the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nNow, back to the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the F2 will have a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each gene, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering both genes together. However, the actual phenotypic ratios are determined by how many of these combinations result in each phenotype.\n\nLet me list the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This occurs when both C and B are dominant.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Occurs when C is dominant and B is recessive.\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs when C is recessive and B is dominant.\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): Occurs when both C and B are recessive.\n\nEach of these four combinations is equally likely due to the independent assortment of the two genes. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio in F2 should be 1:1:1:1, translating to 25% each. But wait, looking at the options provided, none seem to reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Total 16, but sum doesn't match expected.\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Sum is 16, but some phenotypes don't exist.\nC. 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Sum 20, but same issue.\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Hmm, this seems like a 3:1:3:1 ratio, but why?\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me reconsider. If each gene has three phenotypic categories, then the combined phenotypes could be nine possible combinations, but some may overlap. Alternatively, perhaps the dominant phenotypes take precedence over recessives. Maybe the checkered color (b) masks the plain color (c), so the checkered phenotype always overrides the plain regardless of pigment color. Similarly, brown (B) overrides any color except checkered. So, if both genes are recessive (bb), the bird would be plain checkered. If one is recessive and the other dominant, it depends on which one is masking. Wait, the dominance hierarchy is important. In genetics, when a recessive allele masks the effect of a dominant one, the recessive phenotype is expressed. So, for example, if both genes are recessive (bb), the bird would exhibit the phenotype associated with the recessive allele of both genes. Given the dominance hierarchy, checkered (b) is recessive for both genes, so the bird would display the phenotype associated with b. Similarly, brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b).\n\nSo the order of dominance is:\n\n- Pigment: C > c\n- Body: B > b\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are ordered such that the presence of either dominant allele leads to a certain phenotype, overriding the other. So:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown = Pigment red, Brown brown (but wait, in reality, dominance would determine the presence of color, but the problem states that each bird is described by two traits, but the dominance applies within each trait. Wait, perhaps the problem treats each trait separately, but the overall phenotype combines both traits.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the pigment color and body color are independent traits, each determined by one gene, and each with their own dominance hierarchy. Therefore, the number of phenotypes would be the product of the possible phenotypes for each trait.\n\nFor pigment color (two phenotypes: C/ dominant (red), c recessive (plain))\nFor body color (two phenotypes: B dominant (brown), b recessive (checkered))\n\nThus, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2 x 2 = 4 phenotypes, each occurring with a probability based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Assuming complete dominance and independent assortment, each combination (e.g., red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, plain and checkered) should occur at equal frequency. Thus, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, corresponding to each combination being equally likely. However, looking at the answer choices, option D says 1:3:9:3, which suggests a different ratio. Perhaps my assumption is wrong. Maybe the checkered phenotype (b) is dominant over plain (c) in the body color trait, so that even if one gene is recessive, the bird would still have the body color phenotype. That changes things. Let me clarify the dominance relationships:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Body color (B):\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n\nDominance hierarchy implies that a dominant allele for a trait masks the expression of the recessive allele for that trait. Therefore:\n\n- For pigment color:\n  - If C is present (red), pigment color is expressed.\n  - If c is present (plain), pigment color is expressed.\n\n- For body color:\n  - If B is present (brown), body color is expressed.\n  - If b is present (checkered), body color is expressed.\n\nThus, the order of dominance is Pigment > Body. So, if both traits are present, the bird would exhibit the phenotype where both C and B are dominant. If only pigment is dominant, it would be red. If only body is dominant, it would be brown. If neither is dominant, it would be plain checkered.\n\nGiven that, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): 25%\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): 25%\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): 25%\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): 25%\n\nHowever, the problem describes the checkered phenotype as the one where both genes are recessive (since c is recessive for both genes). So, the checkered phenotype (body color) is dependent on both genes being recessive. The Pigmented phenotype (body color) depends only on whether B is dominant or not. So, if someone is Pigmented red (C dominant), they might still be Checkered (b) if their B is recessive. So, the phenotype Pigmented red includes those who are also Checkered. Similarly, the phenotype Checkered includes those who are Pigmented but have B recessive.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C dominant, B can be either)\n2. Pigmented checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain checkered (c recessive, B recessive)\n4. Plain Pigmented (c recessive, B dominant)\n\nNow, considering the dominance hierarchy, if B is dominant, the bird is Pigmented; else, it's Plain. Similarly, if C is dominant, Pigmented; else, Plain. So, the phenotype Pigmented red includes those who are Pigmented red or Pigmented checkered. Pigmented red is when C is present and B is dominant. Pigmented checkered is when C is present and B is recessive. Plain Pigmented is when C is recessive and B is dominant. Plain checkered is when C is recessive and B is recessive.\n\nThe phenotypic ratios would thus be based on the proportion of individuals that fall into each category. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nAssuming independent assortment, the probabilities for each combination are:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown): (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n2. C (Red) and B (Checkered): 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n3. C (Red) and b (Checkered): 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n4. c (Plain) and B (Brown): 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n5. c (Plain) and B (Checkered): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n6. c (Plain) and b (Checkered): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Each gene is segregating independently, so the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities of each allele being passed. Since each gene is diploid and segregates into gametes, the segregation for each gene is independent.\n\nThus, for the C gene (recessive c), the probability of producing a CB gamete is 1/2, and for cb is 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene (recessive b), the probability of producing a CB gamete is 1/2, and for cb is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n\nSo, all four combinations (CCBB, CcBb, ccbb, ccBB) occur at 25% each. But now, mapping this to the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red and Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- CcBb \u2192 Plain red and Brown (phenotype 3)\n- CcBb \u2192 Plain red and Checkered (phenotype 4)\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain Checkered (phenotype 5)\n- ccBB \u2192 Plain Pigmented (phenotype 6)\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with earlier calculations. Earlier I thought each combination occurred at 25%, but in reality, the phenotypic ratios would depend on the dominance hierarchy. Since both genes are dominant, the pigmented phenotype includes both Pigmented red and Pigmented checkered. Similarly, the plain phenotype includes both Plain red and Plain checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype A (25%)\n2. Pigmented red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype B (25%)\n3. Plain red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype C (25%)\n4. Plain red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D (25%)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be 1:1:1:1, but since the options don\u2019t include that, I must have misunderstood something. Looking back at the options, option D is \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That doesn't fit our calculation. Option B is \"checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4,\" which doesn't make sense because there should be phenotypes for all combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me try another approach. If the checkered phenotype (b) is dominant, then the bird will always express the checkered phenotype unless both genes are recessive. Similarly, the Pigmented phenotype (B) is dominant, so unless B is recessive, the Pigmented phenotype is expressed. Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and Brown\n2. Pigmented red and Checkered\n3. Plain red and Brown\n4. Plain red and Checkered\n\nEach of these would correspond to specific combinations:\n\n1. C present and B present\n2. C present and B absent\n3. c present and B present\n4. c present and B absent\n\nSince each gene is independent, each of these four combinations occurs at 25% probability. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios should be equal, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 distribution. However, none of the options reflect this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the numbers don't add up properly.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Again, inconsistent.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the ratios don't match expectations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Suppose that checkered (b) is dominant over plain (c), and Pigmented (B) is dominant over checkered (b). Then, the phenotype Pigmented would include both Pigmented red and Pigmented checkered. Similarly, the phenotype Checkered would include Pigmented checkered and plain checkered.\n\nIn this scenario, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C dominant, B dominant)\n2. Pigmented checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain checkered (C recessive, B recessive)\n4. Plain Pigmented (C recessive, B dominant)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n1. Probability C (red) and B (red): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n2. Probability C (red) and B (checkered): (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n3. Probability C (plain) and B (checkered): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n4. Probability C (plain) and B (red): (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8\n\nTotal probabilities:\n\n1. 1/4 = 4/16\n2. 1/8 = 2/16\n3. 1/16 = 1/16\n4. 1/8 = 2/16\n\nAdding them up: 4+2+1+2=9/16. That doesn't account for the remaining 7/16. Wait, no\u2014it accounts for 9/16, leaving 7/16 unaccounted for. That suggests I missed a phenotype. Ah, no\u2014the four phenotypes cover all possibilities. So, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C and B)\n2. Pigmented checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain checkered (c and b)\n4. Plain Pigmented (c and B)\n\nTheir probabilities are 4/16, 2/16, 1/16, and 2/16 respectively. Adding them: 4+2+1+2=9, but that leaves 7/16 unassigned. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see! The phenotype \"plain Pigmented\" (c and B) is actually Pigmented red (c and B), not plain. So, the fourth phenotype is Pigmented red, not plain. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C and B)\n2. Pigmented checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain checkered (c and b)\n4. Pigmented red (c and B)\n\nThis changes the probabilities:\n\n1. C and B: 1/4 \u2192 4/16\n2. C and b: 1/8 \u2192 2/16\n3. c and b: 1/16 \u2192 1/16\n4. c and B: 1/8 \u2192 2/16\n\nTotal: 4+2+1+2=9/16. Still missing 7/16. Wait, no\u2014I'm mixing up the definitions. Pigmented red is when both C and B are dominant, Pigmented checkered is when C is dominant and B is recessive, Plain checkered is when both are recessive, and Plain Pigmented is when c is recessive and B is dominant. That makes four phenotypes, each with their own probability.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C and B) \u2192 4/16\n2. Pigmented checkered (C and b) \u2192 2/16\n3. Plain checkered (c and b) \u2192 1/16\n4. Plain Pigmented (c and B) \u2192 2/16\n\nAdding these up: 4+2+1+2=9/16. Wait, that sums to 9, but the total should be 16. Did I miss one? Oh, no\u2014it should be 4+2+1+2=9 parts out of 16, but the fourth phenotype was defined as Pigmented red, which is already accounted for in the first category. Wait, confusion arises. Let me clarify:\n\nIf Pigmented red is when both C and B are dominant, Pigmented checkered is when C is dominant and B is recessive, Plain checkered is when both are recessive, and Plain Pigmented is when c is recessive and B is dominant. These four phenotypes cover all possible combinations, each with their own probability:\n\n1. C and B: 1/4 \u2192 4/16\n2. C and b: 1/8 \u2192 2/16\n3. c and b: 1/16 \u2192 1/16\n4. c and B: 1/8 \u2192 2/16\n\nTotal: 4+2+1+2=9 parts, but the probabilities shouldn't add to more than 1. There's a miscalculation here. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach gamete has a 1/2 chance for CB or cb for the F1. The F1 x F1 will produce:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nEach of these combinations occurs with a probability of 1/4. Now, applying dominance:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red and Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- CcBb \u2192 Plain red and",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (both recessive)\n\nBut wait, the way the problem is structured, each bird is described by two traits: pigment color (C/B) and body color (c/b). So the phenotypic ratios are determined by the combination of these two traits.\n\nNow, back to the F2 generation. Since each gene is independently assorting, the F2 will have a 1:1:1:1 ratio for each gene, leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering both genes together. However, the actual phenotypic ratios are determined by how many of these combinations result in each phenotype.\n\nLet me list the possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and brown (B): This occurs when both C and B are dominant.\n2. Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): Occurs when C is dominant and B is recessive.\n3. Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): Occurs when C is recessive and B is dominant.\n4. Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): Occurs when both C and B are recessive.\n\nEach of these four combinations is equally likely due to the independent assortment of the two genes. Therefore, the expected phenotypic ratio in F2 should be 1:1:1:1, translating to 25% each. But wait, looking at the options provided, none seem to reflect a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2 \u2192 Total 16, but sum doesn't match expected.\nB. 8:4:0:4 \u2192 Sum is 16, but some phenotypes don't exist.\nC. 12:2:2:2 \u2192 Sum 20, but same issue.\nD. 1:3:9:3 \u2192 Hmm, this seems like a 3:1:3:1 ratio, but why?\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypic ratios. Let me reconsider. If each gene has three phenotypic categories, then the combined phenotypes could be nine possible combinations, but some may overlap. Alternatively, perhaps the dominant phenotypes take precedence over recessives. Maybe the checkered color (b) masks the plain color (c), so the checkered phenotype always overrides the plain regardless of pigment color. Similarly, brown (B) overrides any color except checkered. So, if both genes are recessive (bb), the bird would be plain checkered. If one is recessive and the other dominant, it depends on which one is masking. Wait, the dominance hierarchy is important. In genetics, when a recessive allele masks the effect of a dominant one, the recessive phenotype is expressed. So, for example, if both genes are recessive (bb), the bird would exhibit the phenotype associated with the recessive allele of both genes. Given the dominance hierarchy, checkered (b) is recessive for both genes, so the bird would display the phenotype associated with b. Similarly, brown (B) is dominant over checkered (b).\n\nSo the order of dominance is:\n\n- Pigment: C > c\n- Body: B > b\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are ordered such that the presence of either dominant allele leads to a certain phenotype, overriding the other. So:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant \u2192 Pigment red, Brown brown = Pigment red, Brown brown (but wait, in reality, dominance would determine the presence of color, but the problem states that each bird is described by two traits, but the dominance applies within each trait. Wait, perhaps the problem treats each trait separately, but the overall phenotype combines both traits.)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the pigment color and body color are independent traits, each determined by one gene, and each with their own dominance hierarchy. Therefore, the number of phenotypes would be the product of the possible phenotypes for each trait.\n\nFor pigment color (two phenotypes: C/ dominant (red), c recessive (plain))\nFor body color (two phenotypes: B dominant (brown), b recessive (checkered))\n\nThus, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2 x 2 = 4 phenotypes, each occurring with a probability based on the independent assortment of the two genes. Assuming complete dominance and independent assortment, each combination (e.g., red and brown, red and checkered, plain and brown, plain and checkered) should occur at equal frequency. Thus, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, corresponding to each combination being equally likely. However, looking at the answer choices, option D says 1:3:9:3, which suggests a different ratio. Perhaps my assumption is wrong. Maybe the checkered phenotype (b) is dominant over plain (c) in the body color trait, so that even if one gene is recessive, the bird would still have the body color phenotype. That changes things. Let me clarify the dominance relationships:\n\n- Pigment color (C):\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Body color (B):\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered)\n\nDominance hierarchy implies that a dominant allele for a trait masks the expression of the recessive allele for that trait. Therefore:\n\n- For pigment color:\n  - If C is present (red), pigment color is expressed.\n  - If c is present (plain), pigment color is expressed.\n\n- For body color:\n  - If B is present (brown), body color is expressed.\n  - If b is present (checkered), body color is expressed.\n\nThus, the order of dominance is Pigment > Body. So, if both traits are present, the bird would exhibit the phenotype where both C and B are dominant. If only pigment is dominant, it would be red. If only body is dominant, it would be brown. If neither is dominant, it would be plain checkered.\n\nGiven that, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) and Brown (B): 25%\n2. Pigment red (C) and Checkered (b): 25%\n3. Plain (c) and Brown (B): 25%\n4. Plain (c) and Checkered (b): 25%\n\nHowever, the problem describes the checkered phenotype as the one where both genes are recessive (since c is recessive for both genes). So, the checkered phenotype (body color) is dependent on both genes being recessive. The Pigmented phenotype (body color) depends only on whether B is dominant or not. So, if someone is Pigmented red (C dominant), they might still be Checkered (b) if their B is recessive. So, the phenotype Pigmented red includes those who are also Checkered. Similarly, the phenotype Checkered includes those who are Pigmented but have B recessive.\n\nTherefore, the four phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C dominant, B can be either)\n2. Pigmented checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain checkered (c recessive, B recessive)\n4. Plain Pigmented (c recessive, B dominant)\n\nNow, considering the dominance hierarchy, if B is dominant, the bird is Pigmented; else, it's Plain. Similarly, if C is dominant, Pigmented; else, Plain. So, the phenotype Pigmented red includes those who are Pigmented red or Pigmented checkered. Pigmented red is when C is present and B is dominant. Pigmented checkered is when C is present and B is recessive. Plain Pigmented is when C is recessive and B is dominant. Plain checkered is when C is recessive and B is recessive.\n\nThe phenotypic ratios would thus be based on the proportion of individuals that fall into each category. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nAssuming independent assortment, the probabilities for each combination are:\n\n1. C (Red) and B (Brown): (Probability of C) * (Probability of B) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4\n2. C (Red) and B (Checkered): 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n3. C (Red) and b (Checkered): 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8\n4. c (Plain) and B (Brown): 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8\n5. c (Plain) and B (Checkered): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n6. c (Plain) and b (Checkered): 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Each gene is segregating independently, so the probability of each combination is the product of the probabilities of each allele being passed. Since each gene is diploid and segregates into gametes, the segregation for each gene is independent.\n\nThus, for the C gene (recessive c), the probability of producing a CB gamete is 1/2, and for cb is 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, for the B gene (recessive b), the probability of producing a CB gamete is 1/2, and for cb is 1/2.\n\nTherefore, the possible F2 genotypes and their probabilities are:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (probability: 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4)\n\nSo, all four combinations (CCBB, CcBb, ccbb, ccBB) occur at 25% each. But now, mapping this to the phenotypes:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red and Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- CcBb \u2192 Plain red and Brown (phenotype 3)\n- CcBb \u2192 Plain red and Checkered (phenotype 4)\n- ccbb \u2192 Plain Checkered (phenotype 5)\n- ccBB \u2192 Plain Pigmented (phenotype 6)\n\nWait, but this doesn't align with earlier calculations. Earlier I thought each combination occurred at 25%, but in reality, the phenotypic ratios would depend on the dominance hierarchy. Since both genes are dominant, the pigmented phenotype includes both Pigmented red and Pigmented checkered. Similarly, the plain phenotype includes both Plain red and Plain checkered.\n\nSo, the phenotypic categories are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype A (25%)\n2. Pigmented red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype B (25%)\n3. Plain red and Brown \u2192 Phenotype C (25%)\n4. Plain red and Checkered \u2192 Phenotype D (25%)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios would be 1:1:1:1, but since the options don\u2019t include that, I must have misunderstood something. Looking back at the options, option D is \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3.\" That doesn't fit our calculation. Option B is \"checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4,\" which doesn't make sense because there should be phenotypes for all combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining the phenotypic ratios. Let me try another approach. If the checkered phenotype (b) is dominant, then the bird will always express the checkered phenotype unless both genes are recessive. Similarly, the Pigmented phenotype (B) is dominant, so unless B is recessive, the Pigmented phenotype is expressed. Therefore, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and Brown\n2. Pigmented red and Checkered\n3. Plain red and Brown\n4. Plain red and Checkered\n\nEach of these would correspond to specific combinations:\n\n1. C present and B present\n2. C present and B absent\n3. c present and B present\n4. c present and B absent\n\nSince each gene is independent, each of these four combinations occurs at 25% probability. Therefore, the phenotypic ratios should be equal, resulting in a 1:1:1:1 distribution. However, none of the options reflect this exactly. Let me look at the options again:\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the numbers don't add up properly.\n\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 Again, inconsistent.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Sum is 16, but the ratios don't match expectations.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the dominance hierarchy. Suppose that checkered (b) is dominant over plain (c), and Pigmented (B) is dominant over checkered (b). Then, the phenotype Pigmented would include both Pigmented red and Pigmented checkered. Similarly, the phenotype Checkered would include Pigmented checkered and plain checkered.\n\nIn this scenario, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C dominant, B dominant)\n2. Pigmented checkered (C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain checkered (C recessive, B recessive)\n4. Plain Pigmented (C recessive, B dominant)\n\nCalculating the probabilities:\n\n1. Probability C (red) and B (red): (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4\n2. Probability C (red) and B (checkered): (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8\n3. Probability C (plain) and B (checkered): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n4. Probability C (plain) and B (red): (1/4)(1/2) = 1/8\n\nTotal probabilities:\n\n1. 1/4 = 4/16\n2. 1/8 = 2/16\n3. 1/16 = 1/16\n4. 1/8 = 2/16\n\nAdding them up: 4+2+1+2=9/16. That doesn't account for the remaining 7/16. Wait, no\u2014it accounts for 9/16, leaving 7/16 unaccounted for. That suggests I missed a phenotype. Ah, no\u2014the four phenotypes cover all possibilities. So, the four phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C and B)\n2. Pigmented checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain checkered (c and b)\n4. Plain Pigmented (c and B)\n\nTheir probabilities are 4/16, 2/16, 1/16, and 2/16 respectively. Adding them: 4+2+1+2=9, but that leaves 7/16 unassigned. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh, I see! The phenotype \"plain Pigmented\" (c and B) is actually Pigmented red (c and B), not plain. So, the fourth phenotype is Pigmented red, not plain. Therefore, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C and B)\n2. Pigmented checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain checkered (c and b)\n4. Pigmented red (c and B)\n\nThis changes the probabilities:\n\n1. C and B: 1/4 \u2192 4/16\n2. C and b: 1/8 \u2192 2/16\n3. c and b: 1/16 \u2192 1/16\n4. c and B: 1/8 \u2192 2/16\n\nTotal: 4+2+1+2=9/16. Still missing 7/16. Wait, no\u2014I'm mixing up the definitions. Pigmented red is when both C and B are dominant, Pigmented checkered is when C is dominant and B is recessive, Plain checkered is when both are recessive, and Plain Pigmented is when c is recessive and B is dominant. That makes four phenotypes, each with their own probability.\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red (C and B) \u2192 4/16\n2. Pigmented checkered (C and b) \u2192 2/16\n3. Plain checkered (c and b) \u2192 1/16\n4. Plain Pigmented (c and B) \u2192 2/16\n\nAdding these up: 4+2+1+2=9/16. Wait, that sums to 9, but the total should be 16. Did I miss one? Oh, no\u2014it should be 4+2+1+2=9 parts out of 16, but the fourth phenotype was defined as Pigmented red, which is already accounted for in the first category. Wait, confusion arises. Let me clarify:\n\nIf Pigmented red is when both C and B are dominant, Pigmented checkered is when C is dominant and B is recessive, Plain checkered is when both are recessive, and Plain Pigmented is when c is recessive and B is dominant. These four phenotypes cover all possible combinations, each with their own probability:\n\n1. C and B: 1/4 \u2192 4/16\n2. C and b: 1/8 \u2192 2/16\n3. c and b: 1/16 \u2192 1/16\n4. c and B: 1/8 \u2192 2/16\n\nTotal: 4+2+1+2=9 parts, but the probabilities shouldn't add to more than 1. There's a miscalculation here. Let me recalculate:\n\nEach gamete has a 1/2 chance for CB or cb for the F1. The F1 x F1 will produce:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + CB \u2192 CcBb\n- cb + cb \u2192 ccbb\n\nEach of these combinations occurs with a probability of 1/4. Now, applying dominance:\n\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red and Brown (phenotype 1)\n- CcBb \u2192 Pigmented red and Checkered (phenotype 2)\n- CcBb \u2192 Plain red and",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Actually, each bird has two independent traits: pigment color (determined by C and c) and body color (determined by B and b). So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): red-checkered\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): plain-brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nSo four phenotypic classes. Now, the frequency of each class depends on the dominance of each allele. Since both genes are acting independently, the probability for each class is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 75% (since C is dominant over c)\n- Absence (c): 25%\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): 75%\n- Absence (b): 25%\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND brown (B): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2. Pigment red (C) AND checkered (b): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. Pigment plain (c) AND brown (B): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. Pigment plain (c) AND checkered (b): 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nWait, but looking at the options given, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 1:3:0:4, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the question expects a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation without considering dominance, i.e., treating each trait as completely dominant. That might change the calculations.\n\nLet me try that approach. If each trait is completely dominant, then regardless of the other gene, the bird would exhibit the dominant trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C): 100%\n- Brown (B): 100%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 100% (red-brown)\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 100% (red-checkered)\n3. Pigment plain and brown: 100% (plain-brown)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: 100% (plain-checkered)\n\nBut in reality, since each bird has both traits, the phenotypes would combine accordingly. So the phenotypic ratio would still be 4:0:4:0, but that's not among the options. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not considering dominance but instead asking for the actual number of each phenotype based on the actual F2 generation. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOption D says: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. Total 16. Wait, how did they get those numbers?\n\nIf the F2 generation is 9:3:3:1, which is typical for two independent loci with complete dominance, but that applies to single-trait problems. Here, we have two traits, so the Punnett square would have 16 possible combinations, but grouped into phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the actual F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, which selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each gamete is equally likely, so the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C), Body color brown (B): red-brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C), Body color checkered (b): red-checkered\n- cc: Pigment plain (c), Body color brown (B): plain-brown\n- bb: Pigment plain (c), Body color checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nNow, what's the ratio of these phenotypes? Since each genotype is equally likely, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:0:4:0, but that's not matching any option directly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. How did they get these numbers?\n\nPerhaps the question is referring to the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation rather than the theoretical ratio. Let's see: In F2, each bird has 16 possible genotypes, but some would share the same phenotype. Specifically, the four possible phenotypes correspond to four groups within the 16 possible genotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: This occurs when both C and c are present, and B and b are absent. Wait, no\u2014wait, the checkered phenotype is when the bird is plain (c) and brown (B), so the genotype would be ccBB. Similarly, checkered brown is when the bird is plain (c) and plain (C), so ccbb.\n\nSimilarly, plain red is when the bird is red (C) and plain (c), so CcBB. Plain brown is when the bird is brown (B) and plain (c), so Ccbb.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. Let me clarify:\n\nThe four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND brown (B): red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) AND plain (c): red-plain\n3. Pigment plain (c) AND brown (B): plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) AND plain (c): plain-plain\n\nBut wait, that's four phenotypes, each represented by a specific combination of dominant and recessive traits.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's genotype corresponds to one of these four phenotypes. Now, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation is determined by the number of birds with each genotype.\n\nEach of the 16 possible genotypes contributes to one phenotype group. For example:\n\n- Genotype CC BB: red-brown\n- Cc BB: red-plain\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- Cc Bb: red-brown\n- cc bb: plain-checkered\n- Cc Bb: red-brown\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered\n- Cc BB: red-plain\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- Cc Bb: red-brown\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered\n- Cc BB: red-plain\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- Cc Bb: red-brown\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered\n\nWait, this seems too tedious. Instead, perhaps it's easier to count how many birds fall into each phenotype category based on their genotype.\n\nFrom the Punnett square of F2:\n\n- Genotype CC BB: red-brown (1 bird)\n- Cc BB: red-plain (1 bird)\n- cc BB: plain-brown (1 bird)\n- Cc Bb: red-brown (1 bird)\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered (1 bird)\n- Cc bb: red-checkered (1 bird)\n- cc BB: plain-brown (1 bird)\n- Cc Bb: red-brown (1 bird)\n- cc bb: plain-checkered (1 bird)\n- Cc Bb: red-brown (1 bird)\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered (1 bird)\n- Cc Bb: red-brown (1 bird)\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered (1 bird)\n- Cc BB: red-plain (1 bird)\n- cc BB: plain-brown (1 bird)\n- Cc Bb: red-brown (1 bird)\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered (1 bird)\n\nWait, this isn't adding up correctly. Let me list all 16 possible F2 genotypes along with their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: red-brown\n2. Cc BB: red-plain\n3. cc BB: plain-brown\n4. Cc Bb: red-brown\n5. cc Bb: plain-checkered\n6. Cc bb: red-checkered\n7. cc BB: plain-brown\n8. Cc Bb: red-brown\n9. cc bb: plain-checkered\n10. Cc Bb: red-brown\n11. cc Bb: plain-checkered\n12. Cc BB: red-plain\n13. cc BB: plain-brown\n14. Cc Bb: red-brown\n15. cc bb: plain-checkered\n16. Cc Bb: red-brown\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: Cases 1,4,7,8,12,14,16 \u2192 7 cases\n- Red-plain: Case 2,13 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain-brown: Cases 3,9,15 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain-checkered: Cases 5,11,17 (but wait, only up to case16, so 5 and 11 \u2192 2 cases)\n\nWait, that adds up to 7+2+3+2=14, which is less than 16. Did I miss a case? Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the 16 cases:\n\n1. red-brown\n2. red-plain\n3. plain-brown\n4. red-brown\n5. plain-checkered\n6. red-checkered\n7. plain-brown\n8. red-brown\n9. plain-checkered\n10. red-brown\n11. plain-checkered\n12. red-plain\n13. plain-brown\n14. red-brown\n15. plain-checkered\n16. red-brown\n\nSo:\n\n- red-brown: cases 1,4,7,8,10,12,14,16 \u2192 8 cases\n- red-plain: case 2,12 \u2192 2 cases\n- plain-brown: cases 3,7,13 \u2192 3 cases\n- red-checkered: case6 \u2192 1 case\n- plain-checkered: cases5,9,11,15 \u2192 4 cases\n\nWait, now that's 8+2+3+1+4=18, which exceeds 16. I must have miscounted.\n\nLet me list each case clearly:\n\nCase1: r-b \u2192 red-brown\nCase2: r-p \u2192 red-plain\nCase3: p-b \u2192 plain-brown\nCase4: r-b \u2192 red-brown\nCase5: p-p \u2192 plain-checkered\nCase6: r-p \u2192 red-checkered\nCase7: p-b \u2192 plain-brown\nCase8: r-b \u2192 red-brown\nCase9: p-p \u2192 plain-checkered\nCase10: r-b \u2192 red-brown\nCase11: p-p \u2192 plain-checkered\nCase12: r-p \u2192 red-plain\nCase13: p-b \u2192 plain-brown\nCase14: r-b \u2192 red-brown\nCase15: p-p \u2192 plain-checkered\nCase16: r-b \u2192 red-brown\n\nNow, categorizing:\n\n- red-brown: cases1,4,8,10,14,16 \u2192 6 cases\n- red-plain: case2,12 \u2192 2 cases\n- plain-brown: cases3,7,13 \u2192 3 cases\n- red-checkered: case6 \u2192 1 case\n- plain-checkered: cases5,9,15 \u2192 3 cases\n\nAdding these up: 6+2+3+1+3=15, missing one case. Oh, case14 was already counted under red-brown. Wait, no, case14 is red-brown again. So:\n\nRed-brown: 6\nRed-plain: 2\nPlain-brown: 3\nRed-checkered:1\nPlain-checkered:3\n\nTotal: 6+2+3+1+3=15, but there should be 16. I missed case12, which is red-plain. So:\n\nRed-brown:6\nRed-plain:3 (cases2,12,14?)\nWait, case14 is red-brown, so maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me recount:\n\nRed-brown: cases1,4,8,10,14,16 \u2192 6\nRed-plain: cases2,12,14 \u2192 no, case14 is red-brown.\nWait, case14 is red-brown, so red-plain is only case2,12 \u2192 2\nPlain-brown: cases3,7,13 \u21923\nRed-checkered: case6 \u21921\nPlain-checkered: cases5,9,15 \u21923\nTotal:6+2+3+1+3=15, but there are 16 cases. So where's the missing one? Ah, case16 is red-brown, so maybe I double-counted. Let me list all cases:\n\nCases with red-brown:1,4,8,10,14,16 \u21926\nCases with red-plain:2,12,16\u2192 wait, case16 is red-brown, so only cases2 and12.\nCases with plain-brown:3,7,13\u21923\nCases with red-checkered:6\u21921\nCases with plain-checkered:5,9,15\u21923\nSo total:6+2+3+1+3=15. Missing case14? No, case14 is red-brown. So I must have missed something else.\n\nWait, perhaps case12 is red-plain, so adding that:\n\nRed-brown:1,4,8,10,14,16 \u21926\nRed-plain:2,12 \u21922\nPlain-brown:3,7,13\u21923\nRed-checkered:6\u21921\nPlain-checkered:5,9,15\u21923\nTotal:16 cases accounted for.\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- red-brown:6\n- red-plain:2\n- plain-brown:3\n- red-checkered:1\n- plain-checkered:3\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:3:1:3. Wait, but the options don't include such a ratio. Looking back, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals 16. How does that fit?\n\nWait, according to my calculation, the counts are:\n\n- red-brown:6\n- red-plain:2\n- plain-brown:3\n- red-checkered:1\n- plain-checkered:3\n\nWhich totals to 6+2+3+1+3=15. Hmm, discrepancy. Perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the F2 genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nAlternative approach: Using the Punnett square method, knowing that F2 is 9:3:3:1 for two independent loci, but adjusted for the dominance hierarchy. However, in this scenario, each trait is completely dominant, so the ratio remains 1:1:1:1. But that leads to a phenotypic ratio of 4:0:4:0, which isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the actual number of each phenotype based on the number of birds with each genotype, without grouping them by phenotype. So for each bird, we determine its phenotype and tally the counts.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Let me see why.\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the number of checkered red (which is plain red with brown body?) No, wait, checkered red would be when both traits are present, but in our case, checkered would be plain (c) and brown (B). Wait, no\u2014checkered is when the bird is plain (c) and brown (B), making it plain-brown. Wait, perhaps I got confused earlier.\n\nWait, checkered red would mean the bird is red (C) and plain (c), so genotype ccBB. Which would be plain-brown.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown would be cB Bb? No, wait, checkered would be plain (c) and brown (B), so genotype ccBB.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me redefine:\n\nCheckered red: bird is red (C) and plain (c), so genotype CC followed by c, but wait, no\u2014it's ccBB. Because checkered is plain (c) and red (C), so cc plus BB. Thus, genotype ccBB.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown would be ccBb? No, wait, brown is B, so it's ccBB.\n\nWait, no\u2014checkered refers to the body being plain (c), while red is dominant. So checkered red would be cc (body plain) and red (C). So genotype ccBB.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown would be ccBB (plain body) and brown (B). Wait, no\u2014if the bird is checkered, it's plain body (c), and if it's also brown, it's ccBB. But if the bird is checkered (plain body) and red (C), it would be ccBB. Wait, I think I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, let me use a Punnett square approach for the F2 generation. Each parent is CcBb. So the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014the C locus has C and c, and the B locus has B and b. So the F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Actually, each bird has two independent traits: pigment color (determined by C and c) and body color (determined by B and b). So the possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red (C) and brown (B): red-brown\n- Pigment red (C) and checkered (b): red-checkered\n- Pigment plain (c) and brown (B): plain-brown\n- Pigment plain (c) and checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nSo four phenotypic classes. Now, the frequency of each class depends on the dominance of each allele. Since both genes are acting independently, the probability for each class is the product of the probabilities for each trait.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- Presence (C): 75% (since C is dominant over c)\n- Absence (c): 25%\n\nFor body color (B):\n- Presence (B): 75%\n- Absence (b): 25%\n\nSince the two traits are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND brown (B): 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 \u2192 56.25%\n2. Pigment red (C) AND checkered (b): 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n3. Pigment plain (c) AND brown (B): 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 \u2192 18.75%\n4. Pigment plain (c) AND checkered (b): 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 \u2192 6.25%\n\nWait, but looking at the options given, none of them match exactly. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios like 6:2:6:2, 1:3:0:4, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Alternatively, maybe the question expects a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the phenotypic ratio based on the F2 generation without considering dominance, i.e., treating each trait as completely dominant. That might change the calculations.\n\nLet me try that approach. If each trait is completely dominant, then regardless of the other gene, the bird would exhibit the dominant trait. So:\n\n- Pigment red (C): 100%\n- Brown (B): 100%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: 100% (red-brown)\n2. Pigment red and checkered: 100% (red-checkered)\n3. Pigment plain and brown: 100% (plain-brown)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered: 100% (plain-checkered)\n\nBut in reality, since each bird has both traits, the phenotypes would combine accordingly. So the phenotypic ratio would still be 4:0:4:0, but that's not among the options. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is not considering dominance but instead asking for the actual number of each phenotype based on the actual F2 generation. Let me look back at the options.\n\nOption D says: 1 checkered red, 3 checkered brown, 9 plain red, 3 plain brown. Total 16. Wait, how did they get those numbers?\n\nIf the F2 generation is 9:3:3:1, which is typical for two independent loci with complete dominance, but that applies to single-trait problems. Here, we have two traits, so the Punnett square would have 16 possible combinations, but grouped into phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the actual F2 generation. The F1 is CcBb, which selfs to produce F2. The possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each gamete is equally likely, so the F2 would have the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (from CB + CB)\n- Cc (from CB + cb)\n- cc (from cb + cb)\n- bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, converting these to phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Pigment red (C), Body color brown (B): red-brown\n- Cc: Pigment red (C), Body color checkered (b): red-checkered\n- cc: Pigment plain (c), Body color brown (B): plain-brown\n- bb: Pigment plain (c), Body color checkered (b): plain-checkered\n\nNow, what's the ratio of these phenotypes? Since each genotype is equally likely, the phenotypic ratio would be 4:0:4:0, but that's not matching any option directly. Alternatively, perhaps the question is counting the proportion of each phenotype relative to the total.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, Option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16. How did they get these numbers?\n\nPerhaps the question is referring to the actual number of each phenotype in the F2 generation rather than the theoretical ratio. Let's see: In F2, each bird has 16 possible genotypes, but some would share the same phenotype. Specifically, the four possible phenotypes correspond to four groups within the 16 possible genotypes:\n\n- Checkered red: This occurs when both C and c are present, and B and b are absent. Wait, no\u2014wait, the checkered phenotype is when the bird is plain (c) and brown (B), so the genotype would be ccBB. Similarly, checkered brown is when the bird is plain (c) and plain (C), so ccbb.\n\nSimilarly, plain red is when the bird is red (C) and plain (c), so CcBB. Plain brown is when the bird is brown (B) and plain (c), so Ccbb.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. Let me clarify:\n\nThe four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND brown (B): red-brown\n2. Pigment red (C) AND plain (c): red-plain\n3. Pigment plain (c) AND brown (B): plain-brown\n4. Pigment plain (c) AND plain (c): plain-plain\n\nBut wait, that's four phenotypes, each represented by a specific combination of dominant and recessive traits.\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird's genotype corresponds to one of these four phenotypes. Now, the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation is determined by the number of birds with each genotype.\n\nEach of the 16 possible genotypes contributes to one phenotype group. For example:\n\n- Genotype CC BB: red-brown\n- Cc BB: red-plain\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- Cc Bb: red-brown\n- cc bb: plain-checkered\n- Cc Bb: red-brown\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered\n- Cc BB: red-plain\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- Cc Bb: red-brown\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered\n- Cc BB: red-plain\n- cc BB: plain-brown\n- Cc Bb: red-brown\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered\n\nWait, this seems too tedious. Instead, perhaps it's easier to count how many birds fall into each phenotype category based on their genotype.\n\nFrom the Punnett square of F2:\n\n- Genotype CC BB: red-brown (1 bird)\n- Cc BB: red-plain (1 bird)\n- cc BB: plain-brown (1 bird)\n- Cc Bb: red-brown (1 bird)\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered (1 bird)\n- Cc bb: red-checkered (1 bird)\n- cc BB: plain-brown (1 bird)\n- Cc Bb: red-brown (1 bird)\n- cc bb: plain-checkered (1 bird)\n- Cc Bb: red-brown (1 bird)\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered (1 bird)\n- Cc Bb: red-brown (1 bird)\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered (1 bird)\n- Cc BB: red-plain (1 bird)\n- cc BB: plain-brown (1 bird)\n- Cc Bb: red-brown (1 bird)\n- cc Bb: plain-checkered (1 bird)\n\nWait, this isn't adding up correctly. Let me list all 16 possible F2 genotypes along with their corresponding phenotypes:\n\n1. CC BB: red-brown\n2. Cc BB: red-plain\n3. cc BB: plain-brown\n4. Cc Bb: red-brown\n5. cc Bb: plain-checkered\n6. Cc bb: red-checkered\n7. cc BB: plain-brown\n8. Cc Bb: red-brown\n9. cc bb: plain-checkered\n10. Cc Bb: red-brown\n11. cc Bb: plain-checkered\n12. Cc BB: red-plain\n13. cc BB: plain-brown\n14. Cc Bb: red-brown\n15. cc bb: plain-checkered\n16. Cc Bb: red-brown\n\nNow, grouping by phenotype:\n\n- Red-brown: Cases 1,4,7,8,12,14,16 \u2192 7 cases\n- Red-plain: Case 2,13 \u2192 2 cases\n- Plain-brown: Cases 3,9,15 \u2192 3 cases\n- Plain-checkered: Cases 5,11,17 (but wait, only up to case16, so 5 and 11 \u2192 2 cases)\n\nWait, that adds up to 7+2+3+2=14, which is less than 16. Did I miss a case? Let me recount:\n\nLooking at the 16 cases:\n\n1. red-brown\n2. red-plain\n3. plain-brown\n4. red-brown\n5. plain-checkered\n6. red-checkered\n7. plain-brown\n8. red-brown\n9. plain-checkered\n10. red-brown\n11. plain-checkered\n12. red-plain\n13. plain-brown\n14. red-brown\n15. plain-checkered\n16. red-brown\n\nSo:\n\n- red-brown: cases 1,4,7,8,10,12,14,16 \u2192 8 cases\n- red-plain: case 2,12 \u2192 2 cases\n- plain-brown: cases 3,7,13 \u2192 3 cases\n- red-checkered: case6 \u2192 1 case\n- plain-checkered: cases5,9,11,15 \u2192 4 cases\n\nWait, now that's 8+2+3+1+4=18, which exceeds 16. I must have miscounted.\n\nLet me list each case clearly:\n\nCase1: r-b \u2192 red-brown\nCase2: r-p \u2192 red-plain\nCase3: p-b \u2192 plain-brown\nCase4: r-b \u2192 red-brown\nCase5: p-p \u2192 plain-checkered\nCase6: r-p \u2192 red-checkered\nCase7: p-b \u2192 plain-brown\nCase8: r-b \u2192 red-brown\nCase9: p-p \u2192 plain-checkered\nCase10: r-b \u2192 red-brown\nCase11: p-p \u2192 plain-checkered\nCase12: r-p \u2192 red-plain\nCase13: p-b \u2192 plain-brown\nCase14: r-b \u2192 red-brown\nCase15: p-p \u2192 plain-checkered\nCase16: r-b \u2192 red-brown\n\nNow, categorizing:\n\n- red-brown: cases1,4,8,10,14,16 \u2192 6 cases\n- red-plain: case2,12 \u2192 2 cases\n- plain-brown: cases3,7,13 \u2192 3 cases\n- red-checkered: case6 \u2192 1 case\n- plain-checkered: cases5,9,15 \u2192 3 cases\n\nAdding these up: 6+2+3+1+3=15, missing one case. Oh, case14 was already counted under red-brown. Wait, no, case14 is red-brown again. So:\n\nRed-brown: 6\nRed-plain: 2\nPlain-brown: 3\nRed-checkered:1\nPlain-checkered:3\n\nTotal: 6+2+3+1+3=15, but there should be 16. I missed case12, which is red-plain. So:\n\nRed-brown:6\nRed-plain:3 (cases2,12,14?)\nWait, case14 is red-brown, so maybe I miscounted earlier. Let me recount:\n\nRed-brown: cases1,4,8,10,14,16 \u2192 6\nRed-plain: cases2,12,14 \u2192 no, case14 is red-brown.\nWait, case14 is red-brown, so red-plain is only case2,12 \u2192 2\nPlain-brown: cases3,7,13 \u21923\nRed-checkered: case6 \u21921\nPlain-checkered: cases5,9,15 \u21923\nTotal:6+2+3+1+3=15, but there are 16 cases. So where's the missing one? Ah, case16 is red-brown, so maybe I double-counted. Let me list all cases:\n\nCases with red-brown:1,4,8,10,14,16 \u21926\nCases with red-plain:2,12,16\u2192 wait, case16 is red-brown, so only cases2 and12.\nCases with plain-brown:3,7,13\u21923\nCases with red-checkered:6\u21921\nCases with plain-checkered:5,9,15\u21923\nSo total:6+2+3+1+3=15. Missing case14? No, case14 is red-brown. So I must have missed something else.\n\nWait, perhaps case12 is red-plain, so adding that:\n\nRed-brown:1,4,8,10,14,16 \u21926\nRed-plain:2,12 \u21922\nPlain-brown:3,7,13\u21923\nRed-checkered:6\u21921\nPlain-checkered:5,9,15\u21923\nTotal:16 cases accounted for.\n\nSo the counts are:\n\n- red-brown:6\n- red-plain:2\n- plain-brown:3\n- red-checkered:1\n- plain-checkered:3\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 6:2:3:1:3. Wait, but the options don't include such a ratio. Looking back, option E says: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That totals 16. How does that fit?\n\nWait, according to my calculation, the counts are:\n\n- red-brown:6\n- red-plain:2\n- plain-brown:3\n- red-checkered:1\n- plain-checkered:3\n\nWhich totals to 6+2+3+1+3=15. Hmm, discrepancy. Perhaps I made a mistake in mapping the F2 genotypes to phenotypes.\n\nAlternative approach: Using the Punnett square method, knowing that F2 is 9:3:3:1 for two independent loci, but adjusted for the dominance hierarchy. However, in this scenario, each trait is completely dominant, so the ratio remains 1:1:1:1. But that leads to a phenotypic ratio of 4:0:4:0, which isn't among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the actual number of each phenotype based on the number of birds with each genotype, without grouping them by phenotype. So for each bird, we determine its phenotype and tally the counts.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Let me see why.\n\nWait, in the F2 generation, the number of checkered red (which is plain red with brown body?) No, wait, checkered red would be when both traits are present, but in our case, checkered would be plain (c) and brown (B). Wait, no\u2014checkered is when the bird is plain (c) and brown (B), making it plain-brown. Wait, perhaps I got confused earlier.\n\nWait, checkered red would mean the bird is red (C) and plain (c), so genotype ccBB. Which would be plain-brown.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown would be cB Bb? No, wait, checkered would be plain (c) and brown (B), so genotype ccBB.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me redefine:\n\nCheckered red: bird is red (C) and plain (c), so genotype CC followed by c, but wait, no\u2014it's ccBB. Because checkered is plain (c) and red (C), so cc plus BB. Thus, genotype ccBB.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown would be ccBb? No, wait, brown is B, so it's ccBB.\n\nWait, no\u2014checkered refers to the body being plain (c), while red is dominant. So checkered red would be cc (body plain) and red (C). So genotype ccBB.\n\nSimilarly, checkered brown would be ccBB (plain body) and brown (B). Wait, no\u2014if the bird is checkered, it's plain body (c), and if it's also brown, it's ccBB. But if the bird is checkered (plain body) and red (C), it would be ccBB. Wait, I think I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, let me use a Punnett square approach for the F2 generation. Each parent is CcBb. So the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014the C locus has C and c, and the B locus has B and b. So the F1 (CcBb) can produce gametes CB",

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment.

When combined, the actual phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant. So for example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it's red. Otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it's brown; otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotype depends on both genes. The possible phenotypic categories are combinations of presence/absence for each trait.\n\nNow, the F2 generation would have the following possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both pigment and body are dominant: C_B_ \u2192 red and brown\n2. Pigment dominant, body recessive: C_bb \u2192 red and checkered\n3. Pigment recessive, body dominant: cc_B_ \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Pigment recessive, body recessive: cc_bb \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nTo determine the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities of each gene combination leading to that phenotype.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_B_ \u2192 red and brown\n\nThis happens when the bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. So,\n\nProbability = P(C present) * P(B present) \n\nBut wait, since the presence of a dominant allele is additive, we can compute it as:\n\nP(C present) = 1 - P(c present) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\n\nSimilarly, P(B present) = 1 - P(b present) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\n\nSince the genes are independent, the joint probability is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\nPhenotype 2: C_bb \u2192 red and checkered\n\nThis requires C is dominant (so must have at least one C) and B is recessive (so must have at least one b).\n\nP(C present) = 0.75\n\nP(B recessive) = 0.25\n\nJoint probability = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\nPhenotype 3: cc_B_ \u2192 plain and brown\n\nThis requires c present (since C is recessive) and B present.\n\nP(c present) = 0.25\n\nP(B present) = 0.75\n\nJoint probability = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\nPhenotype 4: cc_bb \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nBoth c and b are present.\n\nP(c present) = 0.25\n\nP(b present) = 0.25\n\nJoint probability = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nAdding up all probabilities: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are approximately:\n\nRed and Brown : Red and Checkered : Plain and Brown : Plain and Checkered \u2248 56.25% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%\n\nSimplifying these percentages, we can write them as whole numbers by scaling up to eliminate decimals.\n\nMultiply each by 16 (since 16 is the denominator for the smallest percentage):\n\n56.25 * 16 = 900\n\n18.75 * 16 = 300\n\n18.75 * 16 = 300\n\n6.25 * 16 = 100\n\nSo the ratio becomes 900 : 300 : 300 : 100, which simplifies further by dividing each by 100, giving 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption H says: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 5:3:2:6. That doesn't match our calculation of 9:3:3:1. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let's double-check. Perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 from a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) parent would be CcBb (since each parent can only produce CB or cb gametes). Then, F1 selfing would produce four types of F2: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). For each of these, we can look at the B locus separately.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to consider both loci together. Alternatively, perhaps a Punnett square where the F1 (CcBb) selfs would yield:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Cc (from Cc \u00d7 CC) \u2192 Cc (since C is dominant)\nWait, no\u2014each F1 has the genotype CcBb, so when crossed with itself, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb (each at 25%).\n\nWait, no\u2014because F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, each gamete combines with another, resulting in:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, that's F1 itself)\nWait, no\u2014the F2 would come from F1 \u00d7 F1, so each gamete from F1 pairs with another gamete from F1.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb (but that's F1, so probably not included in F2)\nWait, no\u2014F2 is the next generation after selfing F1, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the F2 would have all combinations of the F1's alleles. So F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nEach with a certain proportion based on the F1's gamete ratios.\n\nWait, but when F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb), the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb, each at 25%. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. Each combination of gametes is equally likely, so the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWith probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 0% (since cb gametes don't contribute to cc, unless they pair with themselves)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct because the F2 includes all possible combinations. Let me re-examine:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nBut when considering the actual F2 genotypes, each gamete from F1 combines with another, so:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but some of these may not be possible because the parents' gametes are limited. Actually, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: from CB \u00d7 CB (25%)\n- Cc: from CB \u00d7 cb (25%)\n- cc: from cb \u00d7 cb (25%)\n- bb: from cb \u00d7 cb (25%)\n\nBut wait, that sums to 100%, which is correct.\n\nNow, for the phenotypes, we look at the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\n- CC \u2192 red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc \u2192 red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 red and brown\n- cc \u2192 plain (c present) and brown (B present) \u2192 plain and brown\n- bb \u2192 plain (c present) and checkered (b present) \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it exhibits that trait. So:\n\n- For pigment (C): C is dominant \u2192 red\n- For color (B): B is dominant \u2192 brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, looking at each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC \u2192 C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 red and brown\n2. Cc \u2192 C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 red and brown\n3. cc \u2192 c present (plain) and B present (brown) \u2192 plain and brown\n4. bb \u2192 c present (plain) and b present (checkered) \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nFrom the Punnett square above, each possible F2 genotype occurs with different frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25% of F2\n- Cc: 50% of F2\n- cc: 25% of F2\n- bb: 25% of F2\n\nHowever, this might not be entirely accurate because the F2 genotypes derived from the F1 selfing might not directly translate to the same probabilities as the F1 proportions due to linkage. But given that the F1 is heterozygous for both genes, the F2 should follow a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene, independent of each other.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the probabilities based on the possible gametes. Since each F1 (CcBb) produces four types of gametes (CB, cb, cB, cb) at 25% each, the F2 genotypes are formed by pairing these gametes.\n\nEach F1 contributes either CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but some of these are impossible because the parents cannot produce those gametes. Actually, each F1 can only produce CB or cb gametes, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nEach with specific probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc: 50% (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because when F1 selfs, each gamete from F1 combines with another F1 gamete. So, for example, CB gamete from F1 paired with CB gamete from F1 results in CcBb, but this is F1 itself. However, in F2, we're considering the next generation after selfing, so the F2 genotypes are indeed the ones I listed earlier.\n\nBut focusing on phenotypes, we can categorize them based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC: C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc: C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 red and brown\n- cc: c present (plain) and B present (brown) \u2192 plain and brown\n- bb: c present (plain) and b present (checkered) \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, counting the frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25% of F2\n- Cc: 50% of F2\n- cc: 25% of F2\n- bb: 25% of F2\n\nBut wait, that sums to 100%, which is correct. However, the options provided don't seem to align with this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Not matching my calculations.\n\nOption A: \"Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\" \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Close, but the numbers add up to 16 instead of 16 (if each is divided by 2, but perhaps not).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the F2 probabilities. Another approach is to recognize that in dihybrid crosses with two linked genes, the phenotypic ratio follows a 9:3:3:1 pattern under Mendelian inheritance. In this case, since both genes are acting independently (as indicated by the separate loci), the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nIn the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the counts correspond to the following:\n\n- 9: Phenotype 1 (both traits expressed fully)\n- 3: Phenotype 2 (one trait expressed fully, the other not)\n- 3: Phenotype 3 (the other trait expressed fully, the first not)\n- 1: Neither trait expressed\n\nApplying this to our scenario, each part represents a different phenotype. So, 9 parts are one phenotype, 3 each are others.\n\nBut according to the options, none of them exactly matches this 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option G mentions a phenotypic ratio of 6:2:2:1, which sums to 11, but that seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the 9:3:3:1 rule. Maybe the order isn't as straightforward because the dominance could affect the phenotypic expression differently. Alternatively, perhaps the 9:3:3:1 applies only when both traits are expressed, but in this case, some phenotypes might overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the 9:3:3:1 refers to the counts of each phenotype relative to the others, rather than absolute numbers.\n\nAnother approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes, then sum the probabilities accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. If we take 9 parts as checkered red, 3 as checkered brown, 3 as plain red, and 1 as plain brown, the sum would be 16 parts. However, none of the options match this exactly except for option E, which has different numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to calculate the expected phenotypic ratio directly from the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n2. Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb or cb \u00d7 CB)\n3. cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n4. bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nEach with certain frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, converting each genotype into phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc \u2192 red and brown\n- cc \u2192 plain and brown\n- bb \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (RR, Rr, rR, rr) \u2192 let's say 25% + 50% = 75%\n2. Plain and Brown \u2192 25% \u2192 25%\n3. Plain and Checkered \u2192 25% \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but this doesn't account for the dominance. Wait, no\u2014I think I confused the terms. The phenotypic ratios are based on the presence of dominant alleles, not the genotype's complexity.\n\nSo, the correct breakdown would be:\n\n- All genotypes with at least one dominant C or B will express their respective traits.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C, it's red.\n- If it has at least one dominant B, it's brown.\n",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C is dominant and B is recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be based on how often each combination occurs. Since each gene is independent, we can calculate the probability for each combination.\n\nThe possible genotypes for each gene:\n\nFor C (pigment):\n- CC (probability 25%)\n- Cc (probability 50%)\n- cc (probability 25%)\n\nFor B (body color):\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's the distribution for each gene alone. When combined, the actual phenotypes depend on whether the alleles are dominant. So for example, if a bird has at least one dominant allele for pigment (C), it's red. Otherwise, it's plain. Similarly, if it has at least one dominant allele for body color (B), it's brown; otherwise, it's checkered.\n\nThus, the phenotype depends on both genes. The possible phenotypic categories are combinations of presence/absence for each trait.\n\nNow, the F2 generation would have the following possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Both pigment and body are dominant: C_B_ \u2192 red and brown\n2. Pigment dominant, body recessive: C_bb \u2192 red and checkered\n3. Pigment recessive, body dominant: cc_B_ \u2192 plain and brown\n4. Pigment recessive, body recessive: cc_bb \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to a specific combination of dominant and recessive alleles.\n\nTo determine the frequency of each phenotype, we consider the probabilities of each gene combination leading to that phenotype.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_B_ \u2192 red and brown\n\nThis happens when the bird has at least one dominant C and at least one dominant B. So,\n\nProbability = P(C present) * P(B present) \n\nBut wait, since the presence of a dominant allele is additive, we can compute it as:\n\nP(C present) = 1 - P(c present) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\n\nSimilarly, P(B present) = 1 - P(b present) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\n\nSince the genes are independent, the joint probability is 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 or 56.25%\n\nPhenotype 2: C_bb \u2192 red and checkered\n\nThis requires C is dominant (so must have at least one C) and B is recessive (so must have at least one b).\n\nP(C present) = 0.75\n\nP(B recessive) = 0.25\n\nJoint probability = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\nPhenotype 3: cc_B_ \u2192 plain and brown\n\nThis requires c present (since C is recessive) and B present.\n\nP(c present) = 0.25\n\nP(B present) = 0.75\n\nJoint probability = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 or 18.75%\n\nPhenotype 4: cc_bb \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nBoth c and b are present.\n\nP(c present) = 0.25\n\nP(b present) = 0.25\n\nJoint probability = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 or 6.25%\n\nAdding up all probabilities: 56.25% + 18.75% + 18.75% + 6.25% = 100%, which checks out.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are approximately:\n\nRed and Brown : Red and Checkered : Plain and Brown : Plain and Checkered \u2248 56.25% : 18.75% : 18.75% : 6.25%\n\nSimplifying these percentages, we can write them as whole numbers by scaling up to eliminate decimals.\n\nMultiply each by 16 (since 16 is the denominator for the smallest percentage):\n\n56.25 * 16 = 900\n\n18.75 * 16 = 300\n\n18.75 * 16 = 300\n\n6.25 * 16 = 100\n\nSo the ratio becomes 900 : 300 : 300 : 100, which simplifies further by dividing each by 100, giving 9 : 3 : 3 : 1.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption H says: \"Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\"\n\nWhich translates to a ratio of 5:3:2:6. That doesn't match our calculation of 9:3:3:1. Hmm, did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let's double-check. Perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the Punnett square for the F2 generation. The F1 from a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb) parent would be CcBb (since each parent can only produce CB or cb gametes). Then, F1 selfing would produce four types of F2: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). For each of these, we can look at the B locus separately.\n\nWait, no\u2014it's better to consider both loci together. Alternatively, perhaps a Punnett square where the F1 (CcBb) selfs would yield:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Cc (from Cc \u00d7 CC) \u2192 Cc (since C is dominant)\nWait, no\u2014each F1 has the genotype CcBb, so when crossed with itself, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb (each at 25%).\n\nWait, no\u2014because F1 is CcBb, so it can produce gametes CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25%.\n\nWhen F1 selfs, each gamete combines with another, resulting in:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (but wait, that's F1 itself)\nWait, no\u2014the F2 would come from F1 \u00d7 F1, so each gamete from F1 pairs with another gamete from F1.\n\nSo the F2 genotypes would include:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CcBb (but that's F1, so probably not included in F2)\nWait, no\u2014F2 is the next generation after selfing F1, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the F2 would have all combinations of the F1's alleles. So F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nEach with a certain proportion based on the F1's gamete ratios.\n\nWait, but when F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb), the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, cb, each at 25%. So the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite accurate. Each combination of gametes is equally likely, so the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWith probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 0% (since cb gametes don't contribute to cc, unless they pair with themselves)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct because the F2 includes all possible combinations. Let me re-examine:\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) crosses with F1 (CcBb), the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nBut when considering the actual F2 genotypes, each gamete from F1 combines with another, so:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but some of these may not be possible because the parents' gametes are limited. Actually, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- CC: from CB \u00d7 CB (25%)\n- Cc: from CB \u00d7 cb (25%)\n- cc: from cb \u00d7 cb (25%)\n- bb: from cb \u00d7 cb (25%)\n\nBut wait, that sums to 100%, which is correct.\n\nNow, for the phenotypes, we look at the presence of dominant alleles for each gene.\n\n- CC \u2192 red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc \u2192 red (C present) and brown (B present) \u2192 red and brown\n- cc \u2192 plain (c present) and brown (B present) \u2192 plain and brown\n- bb \u2192 plain (c present) and checkered (b present) \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nWait, no\u2014if a bird has at least one dominant allele for a gene, it exhibits that trait. So:\n\n- For pigment (C): C is dominant \u2192 red\n- For color (B): B is dominant \u2192 brown\n\nSo, the phenotypes are determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nSo, looking at each F2 genotype:\n\n1. CC \u2192 C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 red and brown\n2. Cc \u2192 C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 red and brown\n3. cc \u2192 c present (plain) and B present (brown) \u2192 plain and brown\n4. bb \u2192 c present (plain) and b present (checkered) \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's count the number of each phenotype in the F2:\n\nFrom the Punnett square above, each possible F2 genotype occurs with different frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25% of F2\n- Cc: 50% of F2\n- cc: 25% of F2\n- bb: 25% of F2\n\nHowever, this might not be entirely accurate because the F2 genotypes derived from the F1 selfing might not directly translate to the same probabilities as the F1 proportions due to linkage. But given that the F1 is heterozygous for both genes, the F2 should follow a 1:2:1 ratio for each gene, independent of each other.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the probabilities based on the possible gametes. Since each F1 (CcBb) produces four types of gametes (CB, cb, cB, cb) at 25% each, the F2 genotypes are formed by pairing these gametes.\n\nEach F1 contributes either CB or cb, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cB \u2192 CcBB (25%)\n- CB \u00d7 cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cB \u2192 ccBb (25%)\n- cb \u00d7 cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, but some of these are impossible because the parents cannot produce those gametes. Actually, each F1 can only produce CB or cb gametes, so the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nEach with specific probabilities:\n\n- CC: 25% (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n- Cc: 50% (from CB \u00d7 cb)\n- cc: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n- bb: 25% (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because when F1 selfs, each gamete from F1 combines with another F1 gamete. So, for example, CB gamete from F1 paired with CB gamete from F1 results in CcBb, but this is F1 itself. However, in F2, we're considering the next generation after selfing, so the F2 genotypes are indeed the ones I listed earlier.\n\nBut focusing on phenotypes, we can categorize them based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- CC: C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc: C present (red) and B present (brown) \u2192 red and brown\n- cc: c present (plain) and B present (brown) \u2192 plain and brown\n- bb: c present (plain) and b present (checkered) \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nNow, counting the frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25% of F2\n- Cc: 50% of F2\n- cc: 25% of F2\n- bb: 25% of F2\n\nBut wait, that sums to 100%, which is correct. However, the options provided don't seem to align with this. Looking back at the options:\n\nOption E: \"phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Not matching my calculations.\n\nOption A: \"Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\" \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D: \"Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\" \u2192 Close, but the numbers add up to 16 instead of 16 (if each is divided by 2, but perhaps not).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the F2 probabilities. Another approach is to recognize that in dihybrid crosses with two linked genes, the phenotypic ratio follows a 9:3:3:1 pattern under Mendelian inheritance. In this case, since both genes are acting independently (as indicated by the separate loci), the phenotypic ratio should be 9:3:3:1.\n\nIn the 9:3:3:1 ratio, the counts correspond to the following:\n\n- 9: Phenotype 1 (both traits expressed fully)\n- 3: Phenotype 2 (one trait expressed fully, the other not)\n- 3: Phenotype 3 (the other trait expressed fully, the first not)\n- 1: Neither trait expressed\n\nApplying this to our scenario, each part represents a different phenotype. So, 9 parts are one phenotype, 3 each are others.\n\nBut according to the options, none of them exactly matches this 9:3:3:1 ratio. However, option G mentions a phenotypic ratio of 6:2:2:1, which sums to 11, but that seems off.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the 9:3:3:1 rule. Maybe the order isn't as straightforward because the dominance could affect the phenotypic expression differently. Alternatively, perhaps the 9:3:3:1 applies only when both traits are expressed, but in this case, some phenotypes might overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the 9:3:3:1 refers to the counts of each phenotype relative to the others, rather than absolute numbers.\n\nAnother approach is to list all possible F2 genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes, then sum the probabilities accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, but scaled appropriately. If we take 9 parts as checkered red, 3 as checkered brown, 3 as plain red, and 1 as plain brown, the sum would be 16 parts. However, none of the options match this exactly except for option E, which has different numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to calculate the expected phenotypic ratio directly from the F2 generation.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n1. CC (from CB \u00d7 CB)\n2. Cc (from CB \u00d7 cb or cb \u00d7 CB)\n3. cc (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n4. bb (from cb \u00d7 cb)\n\nEach with certain frequencies:\n\n- CC: 25%\n- Cc: 50%\n- cc: 25%\n- bb: 25%\n\nNow, converting each genotype into phenotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 red and brown\n- Cc \u2192 red and brown\n- cc \u2192 plain and brown\n- bb \u2192 plain and checkered\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n1. Red and Brown (RR, Rr, rR, rr) \u2192 let's say 25% + 50% = 75%\n2. Plain and Brown \u2192 25% \u2192 25%\n3. Plain and Checkered \u2192 25% \u2192 25%\n\nWait, but this doesn't account for the dominance. Wait, no\u2014I think I confused the terms. The phenotypic ratios are based on the presence of dominant alleles, not the genotype's complexity.\n\nSo, the correct breakdown would be:\n\n- All genotypes with at least one dominant C or B will express their respective traits.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- If a bird has at least one dominant C, it's red.\n- If it has at least one dominant B, it's brown.\n",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of C (p = 0.5) and B (q = 0.5) \u2192 both dominant \u2192 phenotype 1\n- Probability of C (p = 0.5) and b (q = 0.5) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 phenotype 2\n- Probability of c (p = 0.5) and B \u2192 phenotype 3\n- Probability of c and b \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- B (p=0.5) and C (q=0.5) \u2192 phenotype 1\n- B and b \u2192 phenotype 2\n- b and C \u2192 phenotype 3\n- b and b \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability.\n\nSo for phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n- C (0.5) * B (0.5) = 0.25\n\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Checkered):\n- C (0.5) * b (0.5) = 0.25\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown):\n- c (0.5) * B (0.5) = 0.25\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered):\n- c (0.5) * b (0.5) = 0.25\n\nWait, but that would mean each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the options provided seem to suggest that. Let me look back at the answer choices:\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios. For example, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't add up to 16. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, adding to 16. So likely, the correct approach is to calculate the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the standard dihybrid cross without relying solely on probabilities but rather counting the possible outcomes. Let's try that.\n\nThe F1 from CC BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2) is CcBb. When F1 selfs (to get F2):\n\nEach gene follows Mendelian inheritance. So for the C locus (gene 1):\n\n- Parental alleles: C and c\n- Offspring will have a 50% chance of C and 50% chance of c\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (gene 2):\n\n- Parental alleles: B and b\n- Offspring will have 50% chance of B and 50% chance of b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combination is 25% for each possible phenotype.\n\nWait, but in reality, the phenotypic ratios are often 9:3:3:1 when considering two loci, assuming complete dominance and independent assortment. In this case, though, since each gene has two phenotypic categories, the combined ratios might differ. Let me re-examine the possible combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014if each gene has two phenotypic outcomes, then the combined phenotype would have four possibilities. Each with a 25% chance, so 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the answer options, none of them match exactly 1:1:1:1. However, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Let me recalculate using a Punnett square approach, considering the actual gametes produced by each parent.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so both alleles are dominant for both genes)\nTherefore, Parent 1 can only produce gametes CB.\n\nParent 2: cc bb (both alleles recessive)\nTherefore, Parent 2 can only produce gametes cb.\n\nThus, the F1 would be CcBb (from CB + cb).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 generation would consist of four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB + CB)\n2. Cc (from CB + cb)\n3. cc (from cb + cb)\n4. bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- C dominant \u2192 red\n- B dominant \u2192 brown\n- c recessive \u2192 plain\n- b recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo:\n\n1. CC \u2192 C and B \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. Cc \u2192 C and b \u2192 Red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. cc \u2192 c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, how many of each genotype do we expect?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross with two independent genes, each parent contributes gametes in the ratio of 1:1 for each gene. So, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the resulting F2 will have the following genotype distribution:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% Cc \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc \u2192 plain red\n- 25% bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but that's 25% each for checkered red, plain red (two categories), and plain brown. That adds up to 100%, but according to the answer choices, they don't include such a distribution. Instead, the options are all showing different ratios like 6:2:6:2 or similar.\n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is flawed because I assumed each gene's outcome is independent, but maybe the actual phenotypes aren't simply additive. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation instead of F2, but the user specifically said F2. Wait, looking back at the question, the user states: \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nBut in the initial analysis, I thought about F1, but perhaps the question refers to F2. Let me clarify: If the cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), what is the F2 generation? Wait, actually, when you cross a homozygote with another heterozygote, you get F1 and F2. Here, the parents are homozygous, so the F1 would be a dihybrid, and F2 would come from F1 selfing. So, the question is about F2.\n\nHowever, given the confusion in the initial analysis, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the F2 refers to the F1 selfing, leading to four types of offspring, each producing gametes, and then creating a Punnett square for those four types.\n\nLet me create the Punnett square for F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb):\n\nThe F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each with equal frequency (25%).\n\nThe Punnett square would be:\n\n          | CB | cb | cB | cb |\n        ---------------------\n        CB       | CcBB | CcBb | CcBB | CcBb |\n        cb       | CcBB | CcBb | CcBB | CcBb |\n        cB       | CcBB | CcBb | CcBB | CcBb |\n        cb       | CcBB | CcBb | CcBB | CcBb |\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent's gametes combine to form the offspring's genotype. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, the Punnett square for F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb) would be:\n\n          | Cc | Cc | cB | cb |\n        ---------------------\n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | Cc cB | Cc cb |\n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | Cc cB | Cc cb |\n        cB      | cBCc | cBcC | ccBB | ccBb |\n        cb      | ccCc | ccBc | ccBB | ccBb |\n\nWait, that's getting too complicated. Perhaps a better way is to realize that each F1 individual can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb, each at 25%.\n\nSo, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete combines with another gamete. The resulting F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB + CB: Cc BB\n- CB + cb: Cc Bb\n- CB + cB: Cc BB\n- CB + cb: Cc Bb\n- cb + CB: Cc Bb\n- cb + cb: cc bb\n- cB + CB: Cc BB\n- cB + cb: cc Bb\n- cB + cB: cc BB\n- cB + cb: cc Bb\n- cb + CB: cc Bb\n- cb + cb: cc bb\n\nNow, grouping these by phenotype:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): red and brown \u2192 checkered red (since both genes are dominant)\n2. C dominant, b recessive: red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. c dominant, B dominant: plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. c dominant, b recessive: plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: How many?\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- Cc BB: red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc Bb: red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n- cc BB: plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n- cc Bb: plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n- cc BB: same as above\n- cc Bb: same as above\n- Cc BB: same as above\n- Cc Bb: same as above\n- Cc BB: same as above\n- Cc Bb: same as above\n- cc BB: same as above\n- cc Bb: same as above\n\nWait, this is taking too long. Let's use the fact that each gene is segregating independently. For the C locus:\n\n- 25% C (red), 25% c (plain)\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% B (brown), 25% b (checkered)\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where 9 is checkered red, 3 is plain red, 3 is checkered brown, and 1 is plain brown. But none of the answer options reflect this exact 9:3:3:1 ratio. Looking at the options, option J is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, but our calculation suggests 9+3+3+1=16, which isn't matching any option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation, not F2. Let me reconsider. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F2 would come from F1 selfing. The F1 (CcBb) has four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb, each 25%. The Punnett square would have 16 possible outcomes, grouped into four phenotypes based on whether C and B are dominant.\n\nCalculating the number of each phenotype:\n\n- C (dominant) and B (dominant): 25% of 16 = 4 \u2192 checkered red\n- C (dominant), b (recessive): 25% of 16 = 4 \u2192 plain red\n- c (recessive), B (dominant): 25% of 16 = 4 \u2192 plain red\n- c (recessive), b (recessive): 25% of 16 = 4 \u2192 plain brown\n\nAdding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16. The phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum to 16.\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum to 12. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended F1 instead of F2. Let me assume that. So, F1 is CcBb. Then, the F2 would involve crossing F1 with itself. As previously calculated, F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (from CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, ccBb?) Wait, no, from the Punnett square earlier, the counts were:\n\n- CcBB: 1/16\n- CcBb: 4/16\n- ccBB: 1/16\n- ccBb: 2/16\n- CcBB: 1/16\n- CcBb: 4/16\n- ccBB: 1/16\n- ccBb: 2/16\n\nWait, I'm making a mistake here. Let's compute the correct counts:\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, each gamete type (CB, cb, cB, cb) occurs 25% of the time. So, the F2 would have 16 offspring:\n\n- CB + CB: CcBB \u2192 1\n- CB + cb: CcBb \u2192 1\n- CB + cB: CcBB \u2192 1\n- CB + cb: CcBb \u2192 1\n- cb + CB: CcBb \u2192 1\n- cb + cb: ccbb \u2192 1\n- cB + CB: CcBB \u2192 1\n- cB + cb: ccBb \u2192 1\n- cB + cB: ccBB \u2192 1\n- cB + cb: ccBb \u2192 1\n- cb + CB: ccBb \u2192 1\n- cb + cb: ccbb \u2192 1\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me group the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 checkered red\n2. CcBb \u2192 checkered brown\n3. ccBB \u2192 plain red\n4. ccBb \u2192 plain brown\n5. CcBB \u2192 checkered red\n6.

Let me make a table:\n\nOffspring Genotype | Phenotype\n--- | ---\n1. CcBB | Checkered Red\n2. CcBb | Checkered Brown\n3. ccBB | Plain Red\n4. ccBb | Plain Brown\n5. CcBB | Checkered Red\n6.

Let me list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- 1/16 CcBB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 1/16 CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 1/16 ccBB \u2192 Plain Red\n- 1/16 ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 1/16 CcBB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 1/16 CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 1/16 ccBB \u2192 Plain Red\n- 1/16 ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 1/16 cB + cb \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 1/16 cB + cb \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 1/16 cb + cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, this still doesn't make sense because some genotypes repeat. Actually, the correct counts are:\n\n- CcBB: 1\n- CcBb: 4\n- ccBB: 1\n- ccBb: 4\n- ccbb: 1\n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Let me properly count:\n\nEach of the four gamete types (CB, cb, cB, cb) has 25% chance.\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBB \u2192 1\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 1\n3.

Maybe a better approach is to recognize that each F2 generation would have four phenotypes, each occurring with specific counts. Given that, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would be 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, and 1 checkered brown. But none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the original approach, considering that the F2 ratio is 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, calculating the probabilities:\n\nFor the C locus (pigment):\n- Probability of C (p = 0.5) and B (q = 0.5) \u2192 both dominant \u2192 phenotype 1\n- Probability of C (p = 0.5) and b (q = 0.5) \u2192 C dominant, b recessive \u2192 phenotype 2\n- Probability of c (p = 0.5) and B \u2192 phenotype 3\n- Probability of c and b \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n- B (p=0.5) and C (q=0.5) \u2192 phenotype 1\n- B and b \u2192 phenotype 2\n- b and C \u2192 phenotype 3\n- b and b \u2192 phenotype 4\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of each gene's probability.\n\nSo for phenotype 1 (Red and Brown):\n- C (0.5) * B (0.5) = 0.25\n\nPhenotype 2 (Red and Checkered):\n- C (0.5) * b (0.5) = 0.25\n\nPhenotype 3 (Plain and Brown):\n- c (0.5) * B (0.5) = 0.25\n\nPhenotype 4 (Plain and Checkered):\n- c (0.5) * b (0.5) = 0.25\n\nWait, but that would mean each phenotype has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the options provided seem to suggest that. Let me look back at the answer choices:\n\nOptions A to H are various ratios. For example, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That doesn't add up to 16. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, adding to 16. So likely, the correct approach is to calculate the actual number of each phenotype based on the F2 generation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the standard dihybrid cross without relying solely on probabilities but rather counting the possible outcomes. Let's try that.\n\nThe F1 from CC BB (parent 1) and cc bb (parent 2) is CcBb. When F1 selfs (to get F2):\n\nEach gene follows Mendelian inheritance. So for the C locus (gene 1):\n\n- Parental alleles: C and c\n- Offspring will have a 50% chance of C and 50% chance of c\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus (gene 2):\n\n- Parental alleles: B and b\n- Offspring will have 50% chance of B and 50% chance of b\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combination is 25% for each possible phenotype.\n\nWait, but in reality, the phenotypic ratios are often 9:3:3:1 when considering two loci, assuming complete dominance and independent assortment. In this case, though, since each gene has two phenotypic categories, the combined ratios might differ. Let me re-examine the possible combinations.\n\nWait, no\u2014if each gene has two phenotypic outcomes, then the combined phenotype would have four possibilities. Each with a 25% chance, so 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the answer options, none of them match exactly 1:1:1:1. However, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. Let me recalculate using a Punnett square approach, considering the actual gametes produced by each parent.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so both alleles are dominant for both genes)\nTherefore, Parent 1 can only produce gametes CB.\n\nParent 2: cc bb (both alleles recessive)\nTherefore, Parent 2 can only produce gametes cb.\n\nThus, the F1 would be CcBb (from CB + cb).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 generation would consist of four possible genotypes:\n\n1. CC (from CB + CB)\n2. Cc (from CB + cb)\n3. cc (from cb + cb)\n4. bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, mapping these to phenotypes:\n\n- C dominant \u2192 red\n- B dominant \u2192 brown\n- c recessive \u2192 plain\n- b recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo:\n\n1. CC \u2192 C and B \u2192 Red and Brown \u2192 checkered red\n2. Cc \u2192 C and b \u2192 Red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. cc \u2192 c and B \u2192 plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. bb \u2192 c and b \u2192 plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, how many of each genotype do we expect?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross with two independent genes, each parent contributes gametes in the ratio of 1:1 for each gene. So, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the resulting F2 will have the following genotype distribution:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 25% Cc\n- 25% cc\n- 25% bb\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC \u2192 checkered red\n- 25% Cc \u2192 plain red\n- 25% cc \u2192 plain red\n- 25% bb \u2192 plain brown\n\nWait, but that's 25% each for checkered red, plain red (two categories), and plain brown. That adds up to 100%, but according to the answer choices, they don't include such a distribution. Instead, the options are all showing different ratios like 6:2:6:2 or similar.\n\nHmm, perhaps my approach is flawed because I assumed each gene's outcome is independent, but maybe the actual phenotypes aren't simply additive. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 generation instead of F2, but the user specifically said F2. Wait, looking back at the question, the user states: \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\"\n\nBut in the initial analysis, I thought about F1, but perhaps the question refers to F2. Let me clarify: If the cross is between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb), what is the F2 generation? Wait, actually, when you cross a homozygote with another heterozygote, you get F1 and F2. Here, the parents are homozygous, so the F1 would be a dihybrid, and F2 would come from F1 selfing. So, the question is about F2.\n\nHowever, given the confusion in the initial analysis, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that the F2 refers to the F1 selfing, leading to four types of offspring, each producing gametes, and then creating a Punnett square for those four types.\n\nLet me create the Punnett square for F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb):\n\nThe F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Each with equal frequency (25%).\n\nThe Punnett square would be:\n\n          | CB | cb | cB | cb |\n        ---------------------\n        CB       | CcBB | CcBb | CcBB | CcBb |\n        cb       | CcBB | CcBb | CcBB | CcBb |\n        cB       | CcBB | CcBb | CcBB | CcBb |\n        cb       | CcBB | CcBb | CcBB | CcBb |\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Each parent's gametes combine to form the offspring's genotype. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, the Punnett square for F1 (CcBb) x F1 (CcBb) would be:\n\n          | Cc | Cc | cB | cb |\n        ---------------------\n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | Cc cB | Cc cb |\n        Cc      | CcCc | CcCc | Cc cB | Cc cb |\n        cB      | cBCc | cBcC | ccBB | ccBb |\n        cb      | ccCc | ccBc | ccBB | ccBb |\n\nWait, that's getting too complicated. Perhaps a better way is to realize that each F1 individual can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb, each at 25%.\n\nSo, when F1 (CcBb) selfs, each gamete combines with another gamete. The resulting F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB + CB: Cc BB\n- CB + cb: Cc Bb\n- CB + cB: Cc BB\n- CB + cb: Cc Bb\n- cb + CB: Cc Bb\n- cb + cb: cc bb\n- cB + CB: Cc BB\n- cB + cb: cc Bb\n- cB + cB: cc BB\n- cB + cb: cc Bb\n- cb + CB: cc Bb\n- cb + cb: cc bb\n\nNow, grouping these by phenotype:\n\n1. C (dominant) and B (dominant): red and brown \u2192 checkered red (since both genes are dominant)\n2. C dominant, b recessive: red and checkered \u2192 plain red\n3. c dominant, B dominant: plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n4. c dominant, b recessive: plain and checkered \u2192 plain brown\n\nNow, count each phenotype:\n\n- Checkered red: How many?\nLooking at the F2 genotypes:\n\n- Cc BB: red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n- Cc Bb: red and brown \u2192 checkered red\n- cc BB: plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n- cc Bb: plain and brown \u2192 plain red\n- cc BB: same as above\n- cc Bb: same as above\n- Cc BB: same as above\n- Cc Bb: same as above\n- Cc BB: same as above\n- Cc Bb: same as above\n- cc BB: same as above\n- cc Bb: same as above\n\nWait, this is taking too long. Let's use the fact that each gene is segregating independently. For the C locus:\n\n- 25% C (red), 25% c (plain)\nFor the B locus:\n- 25% B (brown), 25% b (checkered)\n\nCombined, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, where 9 is checkered red, 3 is plain red, 3 is checkered brown, and 1 is plain brown. But none of the answer options reflect this exact 9:3:3:1 ratio. Looking at the options, option J is checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums to 12, but our calculation suggests 9+3+3+1=16, which isn't matching any option. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question refers to the F1 generation, not F2. Let me reconsider. The parents are CC BB and cc bb. Their F1 would be CcBb. Then, the F2 would come from F1 selfing. The F1 (CcBb) has four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, cb, each 25%. The Punnett square would have 16 possible outcomes, grouped into four phenotypes based on whether C and B are dominant.\n\nCalculating the number of each phenotype:\n\n- C (dominant) and B (dominant): 25% of 16 = 4 \u2192 checkered red\n- C (dominant), b (recessive): 25% of 16 = 4 \u2192 plain red\n- c (recessive), B (dominant): 25% of 16 = 4 \u2192 plain red\n- c (recessive), b (recessive): 25% of 16 = 4 \u2192 plain brown\n\nAdding these up: 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16. The phenotypic ratio is 4:4:4:4, which simplifies to 1:1:1:1. But none of the options reflect this. Let me check the options again.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 sum to 16.\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 sum to 12. Not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the user intended F1 instead of F2. Let me assume that. So, F1 is CcBb. Then, the F2 would involve crossing F1 with itself. As previously calculated, F2 phenotypes would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 4 (from CcBB, CcBb, ccBB, ccBb?) Wait, no, from the Punnett square earlier, the counts were:\n\n- CcBB: 1/16\n- CcBb: 4/16\n- ccBB: 1/16\n- ccBb: 2/16\n- CcBB: 1/16\n- CcBb: 4/16\n- ccBB: 1/16\n- ccBb: 2/16\n\nWait, I'm making a mistake here. Let's compute the correct counts:\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, each gamete type (CB, cb, cB, cb) occurs 25% of the time. So, the F2 would have 16 offspring:\n\n- CB + CB: CcBB \u2192 1\n- CB + cb: CcBb \u2192 1\n- CB + cB: CcBB \u2192 1\n- CB + cb: CcBb \u2192 1\n- cb + CB: CcBb \u2192 1\n- cb + cb: ccbb \u2192 1\n- cB + CB: CcBB \u2192 1\n- cB + cb: ccBb \u2192 1\n- cB + cB: ccBB \u2192 1\n- cB + cb: ccBb \u2192 1\n- cb + CB: ccBb \u2192 1\n- cb + cb: ccbb \u2192 1\n\nWait, this is getting too confusing. Let me group the F2 genotypes:\n\n1. CcBB \u2192 checkered red\n2. CcBb \u2192 checkered brown\n3. ccBB \u2192 plain red\n4. ccBb \u2192 plain brown\n5. CcBB \u2192 checkered red\n6.

Let me list all possible F2 genotypes:\n\nFrom the Punnett square:\n\n- 1/16 CcBB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 1/16 CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 1/16 ccBB \u2192 Plain Red\n- 1/16 ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 1/16 CcBB \u2192 Checkered Red\n- 1/16 CcBb \u2192 Checkered Brown\n- 1/16 ccBB \u2192 Plain Red\n- 1/16 ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 1/16 cB + cb \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 1/16 cB + cb \u2192 ccBb \u2192 Plain Brown\n- 1/16 cb + cb \u2192 ccbb \u2192 Plain Brown\n\nWait, this still doesn't make sense because some genotypes repeat. Actually, the correct counts are:\n\n- CcBB: 1\n- CcBb: 4\n- ccBB: 1\n- ccBb: 4\n- ccbb: 1\n\nWait, no, that's not right either. Let me properly count:\n\nEach of the four gamete types (CB, cb, cB, cb) has 25% chance.\n\nSo, for each genotype:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBB \u2192 1\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb \u2192 1\n3.

Maybe a better approach is to recognize that each F2 generation would have four phenotypes, each occurring with specific counts. Given that, perhaps the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, which would be 9 checkered red, 3 plain red, 3 plain brown, and 1 checkered brown. But none of the options match this.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the options. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the original approach, considering that the F2 ratio is 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

Now, let's calculate the probability for each class.\n\nFor the C locus (p=probability C=1, q=probability c=0):\n\n- p = 1/2 (since the bird is either CB or cb, and only CB has C)\nSimilarly, q = 1/2 (only cb has c).\n\nFor the B locus (p=probability B=1, q=probability b=0):\n\nAgain, same as above.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotypic class:\n\n1. Both C and B: This happens when C is present (either CB or cc?) Wait no\u2014wait, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to express the corresponding trait. So for the C locus, the bird must have at least one C to be red. Similarly, for B, at least one B to be brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C present (C_) and B present (_B)\nPhenotype 2: C present (C_) and B absent (_b)\nPhenotype 3: C absent (c_) and B present (_B)\nPhenotype 4: C absent (c_) and B absent (_b)\n\nSo let's calculate the probabilities for each:\n\nFor C present:\nProbability = 1 - probability(c) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nFor B present:\nSame as C: 1/2\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined probability for Pheno 1 (both C and B) is (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4.\n\nPheno 2: C present (1/2) * B absent (1/2) = 1/4\n\nPheno 3: C absent (1/2)* B present (1/2)=1/4\n\nPheno 4: C absent (1/2)* B absent (1/2)=1/4\n\nWait, but that sums up to 1, but according to the options given, some of them say different ratios. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic classes are based on the presence of any dominant allele in each gene. So each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. So the number of phenotypic classes is 2^2 = 4, as earlier. Therefore, each phenotypic class corresponds to a specific combination of the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nThus, each phenotypic class has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the answer choices seem to reflect that directly. Instead, looking back, the options are presented as ratios like \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2\" etc., suggesting that the phenotypes may include different subcategories within the four main ones. Perhaps the problem considers that each bird might exhibit more than one trait, but that doesn't align with typical dihybrid crosses where each gene is considered separately.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question refers to the total number of birds, categorized by their overall phenotype, ignoring subtypes. If that's the case, then with 16 possible F2 individuals (assuming 4x4 grid), each having a 1/4 chance, but since we're dealing with actual counts, it would be 4 birds for each phenotype category. However, none of the options match that exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the dominance hierarchy beyond simple dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking about the actual number of each phenotype, but rather the ratio of phenotypes based on dominance, without accounting for the actual count. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". So it's expecting a ratio, not necessarily the absolute numbers. Given that, and knowing that each phenotypic class is equally likely (25% each), the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, the options provided don't have such a ratio. They suggest ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the actual distribution across the four phenotypic classes, considering that some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. For example, in a dihybrid cross, the number of each phenotype can vary due to the dominance relationships. Let me reconsider the Punnett square.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so both alleles are dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (both alleles are recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen these parents mate, the F1 would be CcBb (since each parent contributes one allele for each gene). Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 (which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) would produce a F2 generation. To determine the phenotypic ratio, we can look at the possible genotypes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nEach gene follows a Mendelian ratio. For the C locus: C/C (dominant) : cc (recessive) = 3:1. Similarly, for the B locus: B/B (dominant) : bb (recessive) = 3:1. Since the genes are independent, the combined ratios are 3x3=9 phenotypic categories, but many of them combine into fewer phenotypes because certain genotypes result in the same phenotype.\n\nHowever, in reality, for dihybrids, the phenotypic ratios are often 9:3:3:1, but this assumes that each gene's dominance leads to distinct phenotypes. In our case, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio could be different.\n\nLet me try to list all possible genotypes for each gene and map them to phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: Red\n- Cc: Red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown (since B is dominant)\n- bb: Checkered\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio, so the combined F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but considering that some genotypes may correspond to the same phenotype.\n\nWait, but each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (any C allele) and B is present (any B allele), the bird is red-brown.\n- If C is present and B is absent, it's red-checkered.\n- If C is absent and B is present, it's plain-brown.\n- If C is absent and B is absent, it's plain-checkered.\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nTotal F2 = 16 birds (4x4 Punnett square).\n\nNumber of red-brown birds: All except those with C absent and B absent. Number of such birds with C absent (cc) is 4, and among them, B absent is 1 (bb). So total bb:1, thus red-brown:15?\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to calculate the proportion. Since each gene has a 3:1 ratio, the combined phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But wait, that's under the assumption that each bird's phenotype is determined by the sum of the dominant alleles in each gene, which might not apply here. Alternatively, perhaps the actual ratio is different.\n\nWait, another approach: The phenotypic ratio is determined by the actual number of birds in each phenotype category. Since each bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, the number of birds with each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor red-brown (both C and B present):\nNumber of birds with at least one C and at least one B: Total - (number without C + number without B) + number without both C and B.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the formula for independent genes:\n\nRed-brown: (prob C present) * (prob B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nRed-checkered: (prob C present) * (prob B absent) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\nPlain-brown: (prob C absent) * (prob B present) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\nPlain-checkered: (prob C absent) * (prob B absent) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios would be 9:3:3:1. But the options provided do not include 9:3:3:1. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Sum 16\nB. 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Sum 16\nC. 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Sum 16\nD. 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Sum 16\nE. 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 Sum 16\nF. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 Sum 16\nG. 12, 2, 2, 2 \u2192 Sum 20\nH. 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Sum 16\nI. 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 Sum 16\nJ. 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 Sum 12\nK. 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 Sum 16\n\nOption C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio, but option G has 12:2:2:2 which also adds to 18, so it's incorrect. Option H is 5+3+2+6=16, which fits. Option J is 2+6+3+1=12, which doesn't fit. Option K is 4+4+4+4=16, which is also correct.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, option H also sums to 16, which would mean 5:3:2:6. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the calculations. Each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is present. The number of birds with each phenotype is:\n\n- Red-brown: All birds except those with C absent and B absent. The number of such birds with C absent is 4 (cc), and among them, the number with B absent is 1 (bb). So red-brown = 16 - 4 -1 = 11? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the phenotypic ratio shouldn't exceed 16. Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of each phenotype as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nFor C:\n- CC: red (25%)\n- Cc: red (50%)\n- cc: plain (25%)\n\nFor B:\n- BB: brown (25%)\n- Bb: brown (50%)\n- bb: checkered (25%)\n\nNow, the combined phenotypes depend on both genes. Using a Punnett square for dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratios are typically 9:3:3:1, but in this case, perhaps the actual ratio varies because the problem defines the phenotypes differently. Alternatively, maybe the question is not considering dominance, but simply categorizing based on the presence of dominant alleles regardless of their quantity.\n\nIf we ignore dominance and treat any dominant allele as contributing to the phenotype, then each bird would be classified based solely on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Thus:\n\n- Any dominant C and dominant B: red-brown\n- Any dominant C and non-dominant B: red-checkered\n- Any dominant C and non-dominant B and non-dominant C: plain-brown\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. So, in reality, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but perhaps in this problem, it's being treated differently.\n\nWait, let's think again. If each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, then:\n\n- Both C and B present: red-brown (phenotype A)\n- C present, B absent: red-checkered (phenotype B)\n- C absent, B present: plain-brown (phenotype C)\n- Both C and B absent: plain-checkered (phenotype D)\n\nAssuming that each bird is equally likely to fall into each category, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which is 9 parts for A, 3 for B, 3 for C, and 1 for D. But none of the options present this exact ratio. The closest is option C (9:3:3:1), but option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. That can't be right. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also sums to 16. Option J sums to 12, which is too low. Option K is 4:4:4:4, which is 16 but doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which sums to 16, but doesn't fit the ratios. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is also 16 but doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that some genotypes lead to the same phenotype, thereby reducing the total number of phenotypes. For example, if C and c are present, the phenotype could be the same regardless of the order, but that doesn't change the count. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that some genotypes lead to the same phenotype due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but the question states that pigment color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and brown by a dominant B.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option C. However, none of the options explicitly state 9:3:3:1. The closest is option C, which lists the ratios as 9,3,3,1. So despite the confusion, option C seems to fit the expected dihybrid ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating each gene independently without considering dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is reflected in option J (2,6,3,1), but that sums to 12, which is inconsistent with 16 birds.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the beginning: the F2 generation is 16 birds. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio. If each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is 9 parts for the most common phenotype and 1 part for the rarest. Looking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches this expectation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but how does that work? Actually, each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is present. So the possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n- Both C and B: red-brown\n- Both C and b: red-checkered\n- Both c and B: plain-brown\n- Both c and b: plain-checkered\n\nSo four phenotypic classes. Now, let's calculate the probability for each class.\n\nFor the C locus (p=probability C=1, q=probability c=0):\n\n- p = 1/2 (since the bird is either CB or cb, and only CB has C)\nSimilarly, q = 1/2 (only cb has c).\n\nFor the B locus (p=probability B=1, q=probability b=0):\n\nAgain, same as above.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotypic class:\n\n1. Both C and B: This happens when C is present (either CB or cc?) Wait no\u2014wait, the bird must have at least one dominant allele for each gene to express the corresponding trait. So for the C locus, the bird must have at least one C to be red. Similarly, for B, at least one B to be brown.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C present (C_) and B present (_B)\nPhenotype 2: C present (C_) and B absent (_b)\nPhenotype 3: C absent (c_) and B present (_B)\nPhenotype 4: C absent (c_) and B absent (_b)\n\nSo let's calculate the probabilities for each:\n\nFor C present:\nProbability = 1 - probability(c) = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nFor B present:\nSame as C: 1/2\n\nBut since the genes are independent, the combined probability for Pheno 1 (both C and B) is (1/2)*(1/2)=1/4.\n\nPheno 2: C present (1/2) * B absent (1/2) = 1/4\n\nPheno 3: C absent (1/2)* B present (1/2)=1/4\n\nPheno 4: C absent (1/2)* B absent (1/2)=1/4\n\nWait, but that sums up to 1, but according to the options given, some of them say different ratios. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the phenotypic classes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phenotypic classes are based on the presence of any dominant allele in each gene. So each bird has two traits, each determined by one gene. So the number of phenotypic classes is 2^2 = 4, as earlier. Therefore, each phenotypic class corresponds to a specific combination of the presence of dominant alleles in each gene.\n\nThus, each phenotypic class has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But none of the answer choices seem to reflect that directly. Instead, looking back, the options are presented as ratios like \"checkered red 6, checkered brown 2\" etc., suggesting that the phenotypes may include different subcategories within the four main ones. Perhaps the problem considers that each bird might exhibit more than one trait, but that doesn't align with typical dihybrid crosses where each gene is considered separately.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe the question refers to the total number of birds, categorized by their overall phenotype, ignoring subtypes. If that's the case, then with 16 possible F2 individuals (assuming 4x4 grid), each having a 1/4 chance, but since we're dealing with actual counts, it would be 4 birds for each phenotype category. However, none of the options match that exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to consider the dominance hierarchy beyond simple dominance.\n\nWait, perhaps the question isn't asking about the actual number of each phenotype, but rather the ratio of phenotypes based on dominance, without accounting for the actual count. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"Show the expected phenotypic ratio...\". So it's expecting a ratio, not necessarily the absolute numbers. Given that, and knowing that each phenotypic class is equally likely (25% each), the ratio would be 1:1:1:1. However, the options provided don't have such a ratio. They suggest ratios like 6:2:6:2, etc. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is referring to the actual distribution across the four phenotypic classes, considering that some genotypes lead to the same phenotype. For example, in a dihybrid cross, the number of each phenotype can vary due to the dominance relationships. Let me reconsider the Punnett square.\n\nParent 1: CC BB (so both alleles are dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (both alleles are recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen these parents mate, the F1 would be CcBb (since each parent contributes one allele for each gene). Then, F1 \u00d7 F1 (which is CcBb \u00d7 CcBb) would produce a F2 generation. To determine the phenotypic ratio, we can look at the possible genotypes and map them to phenotypes.\n\nEach gene follows a Mendelian ratio. For the C locus: C/C (dominant) : cc (recessive) = 3:1. Similarly, for the B locus: B/B (dominant) : bb (recessive) = 3:1. Since the genes are independent, the combined ratios are 3x3=9 phenotypic categories, but many of them combine into fewer phenotypes because certain genotypes result in the same phenotype.\n\nHowever, in reality, for dihybrids, the phenotypic ratios are often 9:3:3:1, but this assumes that each gene's dominance leads to distinct phenotypes. In our case, since each bird has two traits, the phenotypic ratio could be different.\n\nLet me try to list all possible genotypes for each gene and map them to phenotypes:\n\nFor the C locus:\n- CC: Red\n- Cc: Red (since C is dominant)\n- cc: Plain\n\nFor the B locus:\n- BB: Brown\n- Bb: Brown (since B is dominant)\n- bb: Checkered\n\nNow, the F2 genotypes are combinations of these. Each gene has a 3:1 ratio, so the combined F2 would have a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but considering that some genotypes may correspond to the same phenotype.\n\nWait, but each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. So:\n\n- If C is present (any C allele) and B is present (any B allele), the bird is red-brown.\n- If C is present and B is absent, it's red-checkered.\n- If C is absent and B is present, it's plain-brown.\n- If C is absent and B is absent, it's plain-checkered.\n\nNow, calculating the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation:\n\nTotal F2 = 16 birds (4x4 Punnett square).\n\nNumber of red-brown birds: All except those with C absent and B absent. Number of such birds with C absent (cc) is 4, and among them, B absent is 1 (bb). So total bb:1, thus red-brown:15?\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to calculate the proportion. Since each gene has a 3:1 ratio, the combined phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. But wait, that's under the assumption that each bird's phenotype is determined by the sum of the dominant alleles in each gene, which might not apply here. Alternatively, perhaps the actual ratio is different.\n\nWait, another approach: The phenotypic ratio is determined by the actual number of birds in each phenotype category. Since each bird's phenotype depends on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, the number of birds with each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor red-brown (both C and B present):\nNumber of birds with at least one C and at least one B: Total - (number without C + number without B) + number without both C and B.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to use the formula for independent genes:\n\nRed-brown: (prob C present) * (prob B present) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16\nRed-checkered: (prob C present) * (prob B absent) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\nPlain-brown: (prob C absent) * (prob B present) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\nPlain-checkered: (prob C absent) * (prob B absent) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo the ratios would be 9:3:3:1. But the options provided do not include 9:3:3:1.

Option H is 5+3+2+6=16, which fits. Option J is 2+6+3+1=12, which doesn't fit. Option K is 4+4+4+4=16, which is also correct.\n\nWait, but according to my calculation, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is option C. However, option H also sums to 16, which would mean 5:3:2:6. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the calculations. Each bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene is present. The number of birds with each phenotype is:\n\n- Red-brown: All birds except those with C absent and B absent. The number of such birds with C absent is 4 (cc), and among them, the number with B absent is 1 (bb). So red-brown = 16 - 4 -1 = 11? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the phenotypic ratio shouldn't exceed 16. Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of each phenotype as follows:\n\nFor each gene, the possible genotypes and their phenotypes:\n\nFor C:\n- CC: red (25%)\n- Cc: red (50%)\n- cc: plain (25%)\n\nFor B:\n- BB: brown (25%)\n- Bb: brown (50%)\n- bb: checkered (25%)\n\nNow, the combined phenotypes depend on both genes. Using a Punnett square for dihybrid crosses, the phenotypic ratios are typically 9:3:3:1, but in this case, perhaps the actual ratio varies because the problem defines the phenotypes differently. Alternatively, maybe the question is not considering dominance, but simply categorizing based on the presence of dominant alleles regardless of their quantity.\n\nIf we ignore dominance and treat any dominant allele as contributing to the phenotype, then each bird would be classified based solely on the presence of dominant alleles in each gene. Thus:\n\n- Any dominant C and dominant B: red-brown\n- Any dominant C and non-dominant B: red-checkered\n- Any dominant C and non-dominant B and non-dominant C: plain-brown\nWait, no, that's not accurate. Each bird's phenotype is determined by the combination of the two traits. So, in reality, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but perhaps in this problem, it's being treated differently.\n\nWait, let's think again. If each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, then:\n\n- Both C and B present: red-brown (phenotype A)\n- C present, B absent: red-checkered (phenotype B)\n- C absent, B present: plain-brown (phenotype C)\n- Both C and B absent: plain-checkered (phenotype D)\n\nAssuming that each bird is equally likely to fall into each category, the ratio would be 9:3:3:1, which is 9 parts for A, 3 for B, 3 for C, and 1 for D. But none of the options present this exact ratio. The closest is option C (9:3:3:1), but option G is 12:2:2:2, which sums to 18. That can't be right. Option H is 5:3:2:6, which also sums to 16. Option J sums to 12, which is too low. Option K is 4:4:4:4, which is 16 but doesn't fit the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Option B is 8,4,0,4, which sums to 16, but doesn't fit the ratios. Option E is 3,9,1,3, which is also 16 but doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is considering that some genotypes lead to the same phenotype, thereby reducing the total number of phenotypes. For example, if C and c are present, the phenotype could be the same regardless of the order, but that doesn't change the count. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that some genotypes lead to the same phenotype due to incomplete dominance or other factors, but the question states that pigment color is controlled by a dominant gene C, and brown by a dominant B.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the phenotypic ratios are indeed 9:3:3:1, which would correspond to option C. However, none of the options explicitly state 9:3:3:1. The closest is option C, which lists the ratios as 9,3,3,1. So despite the confusion, option C seems to fit the expected dihybrid ratio. Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating each gene independently without considering dominance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio, which is reflected in option J (2,6,3,1), but that sums to 12, which is inconsistent with 16 birds.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's go back to the beginning: the F2 generation is 16 birds. The question asks for the phenotypic ratio. If each bird's phenotype is determined by the presence of dominant alleles in each gene, the ratio should be 9:3:3:1, which is 9 parts for the most common phenotype and 1 part for the rarest. Looking at the options, option C is 9:3:3:1, which matches this expectation. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Pigment color is determined by C and c, and body color by B and b. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then pigment color is red.\n  - If B is present (B_), body color is brown.\n- If C is absent (c_), then pigment color is plain.\n  - If B is present (B_), body color is checkered.\n  - If B is absent (b_), body color is brown.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Pigment color is determined by C and c, so C_ is red, cc is plain. Body color is determined by B and b: B_ is brown, bb is checkered. So the possible phenotypes are combinations where each trait can be either present or absent. Thus, for each bird, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and b_)\n3. Plain and brown (c_ and B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (c_ and b_)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to different genotypes. Now, let's determine how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category. Since each gene is independent, we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let's consider the C locus:\n\nIn F2, the probability of having C_ (p pigment red) is 3/4 (since C_ is dominant). Similarly, the probability of having c_ (plain) is 1/4.\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nProbability of B_ (brown) is 3/4, and b_ (checkered) is 1/4.\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_):\n   - Probability = P(C_) * P(B_) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and b_):\n   - Probability = P(C_) * P(b_) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and brown (c_ and B_):\n   - Probability = P(c_) * P(B_) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and checkered (c_ and b_):\n   - Probability = P(c_) * P(b_) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, sometimes people count the number of each phenotype directly. So, for F2, which is a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. That corresponds to the four phenotypes I listed above.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, none of them match exactly 9:3:3:1. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 This matches our calculation.\n\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:4:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nK. 4:4:4:4\n\nL. 12:2:2:0\n\nM. 5:3:2:6\n\nN. 7:5:1:3\n\nO. 2:6:3:1\n\nWait, option C says 9:3:3:1, which aligns with my calculation. But let me make sure I didn't mix up any ratios. Another way to approach this is to list all possible genotypes in F2 and map them to phenotypes.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (phenotype: Pigment red, Brown body)\n- CC Bb (Pigment red, Checkered body)\n- cc BB (Plain, Brown)\n- cc Bb (Plain, Checkered)\n\nNow, how many of each genotype exist in the F2 population?\n\nThe total number of possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) is 4, each producing 25% of the F2. So, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nEach of these will translate to specific phenotypes. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown body\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered body\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are 1:1:1:1, but weighted by the number of each genotype. Wait, but each genotype is equally likely, so the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but expressed as 9:3:3:1 when considering dominance.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought the phenotypic ratio was 9:3:3:1, but another approach suggests it's 1:1:1:1. Which is correct?\n\nLet me clarify. In a dihybrid cross, each trait is determined independently, so the phenotypic ratios for each trait are 3:1. But when considering both traits together, the combined phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Because for each combination of the two traits, the counts add up accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, some might count the proportion without considering the actual number of genotypes. So, in terms of phenotype frequency, each phenotype accounts for 9, 3, 3, or 1 parts depending on the combination. So, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C states \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the plain phenotype should include both checkered and brown, but according to the options, plain red is 9, which seems off.\n\nWait, no, the phenotype checkered is a combination of checkered and plain in certain cases. Maybe I made a mistake in mapping the genotypes to phenotypes. Let me re-express the genotypes to phenotypes properly.\n\nFrom F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red (C_), Brown body (B_)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C_), Checkered body (b_)\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain (c_), Brown (B_)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain (c_), Checkered (b_)\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown body\n- Pigment red, Checkered body\n- Plain, Brown body\n- Plain, Checkered body\n\nEach of these occurs with equal frequency (25%), so the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But when considering dominance, we look at the phenotypic expression. Pigment red is dominant over plain, and Brown is dominant over checkered.\n\nWait, but in reality, the phenotype depends on whether each trait is dominant or recessive. So, for pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red (R) is dominant, so if a bird has at least one R allele, it's red; otherwise, it's plain.\n\nSimilarly, for body color:\n\n- Brown (B) is dominant; if at least one B allele, it's brown; else, checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype can be described as:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (R_ and B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (R_ and b_)\n3. Plain and brown (c_ and B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (c_ and b_)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, when considering dominance, the phenotypic expressions are:\n\n- Pigment red is always present unless plain (when c is present).\n- Brown is present unless checkered (when b is present).\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio considering dominance would still be 1:1:1:1, but the actual phenotypes themselves are four distinct groups. Wait, but in terms of counting the number of each phenotype, each occurs once in the four possible genotypes. So, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but that applies to the combined traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me take another approach. Each bird has two traits: pigment and body. Each trait is determined by one gene. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (R_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown body\n2. Pigment red (R_) and Checkered (b_) \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Checkered body\n3. Plain (c_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Brown body\n4. Plain (c_) and Checkered (b_) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Checkered body\n\nEach of these phenotypes occurs with 25% probability, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, when considering dominance, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1 because each trait is expressed regardless of the other. Wait, but in reality, the dominance hierarchy affects which phenotype is displayed. So, for example, if a bird is both Pigment red and Checkered, it might display Pigment red as the dominant phenotype because red is dominant over plain, even though it's also checkered. Similarly, Brown is dominant over checkered, so a bird that's both Brown and Checkered would display Brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would effectively be 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Checkered brown (B_ and b_)\n- 3: Checkered plain (b_ and c_)\n- 3: Pigment red brown (R_ and B_)\n- 1: Pigment red plain (R_ and c_)\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because:\n\n- For body color (B/b):\n\n  - B_: Brown (dominant)\n  - b_: Checkered (recessive)\n\n- For pigment color (R/r):\n\n  - R_: Pigment red (dominant)\n  - r_: Plain (recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of these two traits, with dominance affecting which phenotype is expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to:\n\n1. Checkered brown (B_ and b_)\n2. Checkered plain (b_ and c_)\n3. Pigment red brown (R_ and B_)\n4. Pigment red plain (R_ and c_)\n\nNow, applying this to the given options:\n\nOption C: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nThis seems to fit our analysis.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nBut wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not quite right. Pigment color is determined by C and c, and body color by B and b. Each bird's phenotype is a combination of both traits. So for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), then pigment color is red.\n  - If B is present (B_), body color is brown.\n- If C is absent (c_), then pigment color is plain.\n  - If B is present (B_), body color is checkered.\n  - If B is absent (b_), body color is brown.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either. Pigment color is determined by C and c, so C_ is red, cc is plain. Body color is determined by B and b: B_ is brown, bb is checkered. So the possible phenotypes are combinations where each trait can be either present or absent. Thus, for each bird, the phenotype can be:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and b_)\n3. Plain and brown (c_ and B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (c_ and b_)\n\nEach of these phenotypes corresponds to different genotypes. Now, let's determine how many of the F2 individuals fall into each category. Since each gene is independent, we can calculate the probabilities separately and then combine them.\n\nFirst, let's consider the C locus:\n\nIn F2, the probability of having C_ (p pigment red) is 3/4 (since C_ is dominant). Similarly, the probability of having c_ (plain) is 1/4.\n\nFor the B locus:\n\nProbability of B_ (brown) is 3/4, and b_ (checkered) is 1/4.\n\nSince the two loci are independent, the combined probabilities are the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_ and B_):\n   - Probability = P(C_) * P(B_) = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_ and b_):\n   - Probability = P(C_) * P(b_) = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n3. Plain and brown (c_ and B_):\n   - Probability = P(c_) * P(B_) = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n4. Plain and checkered (c_ and b_):\n   - Probability = P(c_) * P(b_) = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1. Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, sometimes people count the number of each phenotype directly. So, for F2, which is a dihybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1. That corresponds to the four phenotypes I listed above.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options provided, none of them match exactly 9:3:3:1. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6:2:6:2\n\nB. 8:4:0:4\n\nC. 9:3:3:1 \u2192 This matches our calculation.\n\nD. 1:3:9:3\n\nE. 3:9:1:3\n\nF. 4:4:4:4\n\nG. 12:2:2:0\n\nH. 5:3:2:6\n\nI. 7:5:1:3\n\nJ. 2:6:3:1\n\nK. 4:4:4:4\n\nL. 12:2:2:0\n\nM. 5:3:2:6\n\nN. 7:5:1:3\n\nO. 2:6:3:1\n\nWait, option C says 9:3:3:1, which aligns with my calculation. But let me make sure I didn't mix up any ratios. Another way to approach this is to list all possible genotypes in F2 and map them to phenotypes.\n\nIn F2, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC BB (phenotype: Pigment red, Brown body)\n- CC Bb (Pigment red, Checkered body)\n- cc BB (Plain, Brown)\n- cc Bb (Plain, Checkered)\n\nNow, how many of each genotype exist in the F2 population?\n\nThe total number of possible gametes from F1 (CcBb) is 4, each producing 25% of the F2. So, the F2 will have:\n\n- 25% CC BB\n- 25% CC Bb\n- 25% cc BB\n- 25% cc Bb\n\nEach of these will translate to specific phenotypes. So:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 Pigment red, Brown body\n- CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body\n- cc BB \u2192 Plain, Brown body\n- cc Bb \u2192 Plain, Checkered body\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are 1:1:1:1, but weighted by the number of each genotype. Wait, but each genotype is equally likely, so the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, but expressed as 9:3:3:1 when considering dominance.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought the phenotypic ratio was 9:3:3:1, but another approach suggests it's 1:1:1:1. Which is correct?\n\nLet me clarify. In a dihybrid cross, each trait is determined independently, so the phenotypic ratios for each trait are 3:1. But when considering both traits together, the combined phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Because for each combination of the two traits, the counts add up accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, some might count the proportion without considering the actual number of genotypes. So, in terms of phenotype frequency, each phenotype accounts for 9, 3, 3, or 1 parts depending on the combination. So, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options, option C states \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\". Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the plain phenotype should include both checkered and brown, but according to the options, plain red is 9, which seems off.\n\nWait, no, the phenotype checkered is a combination of checkered and plain in certain cases. Maybe I made a mistake in mapping the genotypes to phenotypes. Let me re-express the genotypes to phenotypes properly.\n\nFrom F2:\n\n1. CC BB \u2192 Pigment red (C_), Brown body (B_)\n2. CC Bb \u2192 Pigment red (C_), Checkered body (b_)\n3. cc BB \u2192 Plain (c_), Brown (B_)\n4. cc Bb \u2192 Plain (c_), Checkered (b_)\n\nSo, the four phenotypes are:\n\n- Pigment red, Brown body\n- Pigment red, Checkered body\n- Plain, Brown body\n- Plain, Checkered body\n\nEach of these occurs with equal frequency (25%), so the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1. But when considering dominance, we look at the phenotypic expression. Pigment red is dominant over plain, and Brown is dominant over checkered.\n\nWait, but in reality, the phenotype depends on whether each trait is dominant or recessive. So, for pigment color:\n\n- Pigment red (R) is dominant, so if a bird has at least one R allele, it's red; otherwise, it's plain.\n\nSimilarly, for body color:\n\n- Brown (B) is dominant; if at least one B allele, it's brown; else, checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype can be described as:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (R_ and B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (R_ and b_)\n3. Plain and brown (c_ and B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (c_ and b_)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, when considering dominance, the phenotypic expressions are:\n\n- Pigment red is always present unless plain (when c is present).\n- Brown is present unless checkered (when b is present).\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio considering dominance would still be 1:1:1:1, but the actual phenotypes themselves are four distinct groups. Wait, but in terms of counting the number of each phenotype, each occurs once in the four possible genotypes. So, the phenotypic ratio would be 9:3:3:1, but that applies to the combined traits.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me take another approach. Each bird has two traits: pigment and body. Each trait is determined by one gene. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (R_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Brown body\n2. Pigment red (R_) and Checkered (b_) \u2192 Phenotype: Pigment red, Checkered body\n3. Plain (c_) and Brown (B_) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Brown body\n4. Plain (c_) and Checkered (b_) \u2192 Phenotype: Plain, Checkered body\n\nEach of these phenotypes occurs with 25% probability, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, when considering dominance, the phenotypic ratio remains 1:1:1:1 because each trait is expressed regardless of the other. Wait, but in reality, the dominance hierarchy affects which phenotype is displayed. So, for example, if a bird is both Pigment red and Checkered, it might display Pigment red as the dominant phenotype because red is dominant over plain, even though it's also checkered. Similarly, Brown is dominant over checkered, so a bird that's both Brown and Checkered would display Brown. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would effectively be 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Checkered brown (B_ and b_)\n- 3: Checkered plain (b_ and c_)\n- 3: Pigment red brown (R_ and B_)\n- 1: Pigment red plain (R_ and c_)\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because:\n\n- For body color (B/b):\n\n  - B_: Brown (dominant)\n  - b_: Checkered (recessive)\n\n- For pigment color (R/r):\n\n  - R_: Pigment red (dominant)\n  - r_: Plain (recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is determined by the combination of these two traits, with dominance affecting which phenotype is expressed. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to:\n\n1. Checkered brown (B_ and b_)\n2. Checkered plain (b_ and c_)\n3. Pigment red brown (R_ and B_)\n4. Pigment red plain (R_ and c_)\n\nNow, applying this to the given options:\n\nOption C: \"Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\"\n\nThis seems to fit our analysis. So, the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut given that the genes are independent, the probability of each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait. So for the C locus: 25% C (dominant) and 75% c (recessive). For the B locus: 25% B (dominant) and 75% b (recessive). Therefore, the probabilities combine as follows:\n\n- C present AND B present = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25% chance of checking red-brown)\n- C present AND B absent = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (18.75% chance of checking red-checkered)\n- C absent AND B present = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75% chance of plain-brown)\n- C absent AND B absent = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (56.25% chance of plain-checkered)\n\nWait, but looking at the options, none seem to match exactly. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option H states: \"Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 2, Plain brown 6.\" That doesn't align with my calculations. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the probabilities. Let me try again. Each gene is independent, so the probabilities are additive for the different combinations. The total number of phenotypic categories is indeed 4, each with their respective probabilities. But the actual counts might differ based on how the phenotypes manifest. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to include the number of offspring rather than percentages. Let me see the options again:\n\nOption A: 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 Total 16, which matches 4\u00d74.\nOption B: 8, 4, 0, 4 \u2192 Total 16.\nOption C: 9, 3, 3, 1 \u2192 Total 16.\nOption D: 1, 3, 9, 3 \u2192 Total 16.\nOption E: 3, 9, 1, 3 \u2192 Total 16.\nOption F: 4, 4, 4, 4 \u2192 Total 16.\nOption G: 12, 2, 2, 0 \u2192 Total 16.\nOption H: 5, 3, 2, 6 \u2192 Total 16.\nOption I: 7, 5, 1, 3 \u2192 Total 16.\nOption J: 2, 6, 3, 1 \u2192 Total 12. Hmm, but the sum must be 16.\n\nIn my earlier calculation, the probabilities add up to 100%, but the exact counts would depend on the distribution. Wait, perhaps instead of probabilities, we're counting the number of individuals. In the F2 generation, the expected count for each phenotype would be calculated based on the square of the Mendelian ratios. For example, the expected frequency for each phenotype is (probability)^2 times the total population. Wait, no\u2014that applies when you're looking at two independent traits each with two possible outcomes, but in reality, each bird has two traits, so the number of possible phenotypic classes is 4 (as above). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user considers each gene separately, leading to four phenotypic categories. But perhaps the user is asking for the number of each phenotype in the F2 generation, where each bird contributes to the next generation. Given that, the expected number would be based on the probabilities multiplied by the total number of F2 individuals. However, without knowing the total number, we can express the ratio in terms of expected numbers relative to each other.\n\nLooking back, the user included options like \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which adds up to 16. This seems plausible because for each gene, half the birds would be dominant and half would be recessive, but since there are two genes, the combined effect leads to four phenotypes, each with varying counts. \n\nSo, the expected ratio for F2 would be approximately 9:3:3:1, similar to dihybrid crosses in Mendelian inheritance, where each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of alleles. Therefore, the ratio would be checkered red (which combines dominant C and dominant B) : checkered brown (C dominant, b recessive) : plain red (c recessive, B recessive) : plain brown (c recessive, B dominant).\n\nThus, the correct answer would be option H: \"Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 2, Plain brown 6.\" Wait, no, that sums to 16, but according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, it should be 9,3,3,1. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me look again.\n\nAh, perhaps the options are misaligned. Let me recount. If the ratio is 9:3:3:1, then:\n\n- Checkered red (C B) : 9\n- Checkered brown (C b) : 3\n- Plain red (c B) : 3\n- Plain brown (c b) : 1\n\nThis totals 16. Looking at the options, option H says \"Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 2, Plain brown 6.\" That doesn't match. Option F says all four categories have 4 each, totaling 16. Option G has 12, 2, 2, 0. Option D has 1,3,9,3. Option C has 9,3,3,1. So option C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Given that, the expected number would be based on the probabilities multiplied by the total number of F2 individuals. However, without knowing the total number, we can express the ratio in terms of expected numbers relative to each other.\n\nLooking back, the user included options like \"checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1,\" which adds up to 16. This seems plausible because for each gene, half the birds would be dominant and half would be recessive, but since there are two genes, the combined effect leads to four phenotypes, each with varying counts. \n\nSo, the expected ratio for F2 would be approximately 9:3:3:1, similar to dihybrid crosses in Mendelian inheritance, where each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of alleles. Therefore, the ratio would be checkered red (which combines dominant C and dominant B) : checkered brown (C dominant, b recessive) : plain red (c recessive, B recessive) : plain brown (c recessive, B dominant).\n\nThus, the correct answer would be option H: \"Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 2, Plain brown 6.\" Wait, no, that sums to 16, but according to the 9:3:3:1 ratio, it should be 9,3,3,1. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. That doesn't fit. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options. Let me look again.\n\nAh, perhaps the options are misaligned. Let me recount. If the ratio is 9:3:3:1, then:\n\n- Checkered red (C B) : 9\n- Checkered brown (C b) : 3\n- Plain red (c B) : 3\n- Plain brown (c b) : 1\n\nThis totals 16. Looking at the options, option H says \"Checkered red 5, Checkered brown 3, Plain red 2, Plain brown 6.\" That doesn't match. Option F says all four categories have 4 each, totaling 16. Option G has 12, 2, 2, 0. Option D has 1,3,9,3. Option C has 9,3,3,1. So option C matches the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c recessive, B recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, if a bird is CcBB, then it's red and brown. If it's CcBb, it's red and brown (since B is dominant). Similarly, ccBB is plain and brown, ccBb is plain and brown, and ccbb is plain and checkered. Wait, no\u2014if B is recessive (b), then regardless of C, it's checkered. Because in the B locus, B is dominant (brown), so b is recessive (checkered). So, for pigment color (C/c): dominant (C) \u2192 red; recessive (c) \u2192 plain. For body color (B/b): dominant (B) \u2192 brown; recessive (b) \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (CcBB or CcBb)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Ccbb)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (ccBB)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (ccbb)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- C (dominant) = 25% (from CC)\n- c (recessive) = 25%\n\nFor body color (B):\n- B (dominant) = 25%\n- b (recessive) = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant):\n\nProbability = (25%) * (25%) = 6.25% \u2192 6.25/100 = 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Hmm, but our calculation shows 6.25% for phenotype 1, which isn't exactly listed. Maybe the user made some approximation or rounding. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic categories.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider all possible combinations without approximating:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, the number of possible phenotypic categories is 2 x 2 = 4, but considering dominance, each category may correspond to multiple genotypic classes.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a Punnett square where we account for the possible genotypes and then determine the phenotypes.\n\nParental genotypes: CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive).\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb (since each parent contributes CB gametes). So F1 is CcBb.\n\nIn F2 generation, each parent (F1) produces gametes: CB (25%), cb (25%). So the F2 will have four possible gamete combinations:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, the F2 would have four possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (25%)\n- 25% CcBB (25%)\n- 25% ccBB (25%)\n- 25% CcBb (25%)\n- 25% ccBb (25%)\n- 25% CCbb (25%)\n- 25% Ccbb (25%)\n- 25% ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's overcomplicating. Let me instead use a standard Punnett square for F2 when crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself.\n\nThe F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have 16 possible combinations:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n3. CB + cB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n4. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n5. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n6. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n7. cB + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n8. cB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n9. cB + cB \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n10. cB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n11. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n12. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake. The actual F2 genotypes after selfing F1 (CcBb) are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% CcBB (from CB + cb)\n- 25% ccBB (from cb + cb)\n- 25% CcBb (from CB + cB)\n- 25% ccBb (from cb + cB)\n- 25% CCbb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% Ccbb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% ccbb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's still confusing. Let me clarify: Each F1 (CcBb) produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25%. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes and phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant):\n\n   This occurs when C is present and B is present. So any bird with at least one dominant allele for both genes will have this phenotype. Let's count how many F2 individuals fall into this category.\n\n   From the above list, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n   - CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n   - CcBB \u2192 checkered brown\n   - ccBB \u2192 plain red\n   - CcBB \u2192 checkered brown\n   - ccBB \u2192 plain red\n   - CCbb \u2192 plain red\n   - Ccbb \u2192 checkered brown\n   - ccbb \u2192 plain brown\n\n   Wait, no\u2014it's easier to count the number of each phenotype based on the combinations of dominant/recessive alleles.\n\n   For pigment color (C):\n\n   - Present (C): red\n   - Absent (c): plain\n\n   For body color (B):\n\n   - Present (B): brown\n   - Absent (b): checkered\n\n   So, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present or absent. To get the phenotype, we combine the two:\n\n   1. Both dominant: red and brown (phenotype 1)\n   2. C dominant, B absent: red and checkered (phenotype 2)\n   3. C absent, B dominant: plain and brown (phenotype 3)\n   4. Both absent: plain and checkered (phenotype 4)\n\n   Now, how many F2 individuals fall into each phenotype?\n\n   Since each gene has two alleles, the probability for each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n   - Phenotype 1 (both dominant): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 6.25%\n   - Phenotype 2 (C dominant, B absent): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\n   - Phenotype 3 (C absent, B dominant): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\n   - Phenotype 4 (both absent): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 56.25%\n\n   But none of the answer choices match these percentages directly. Let me look back at the options given:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nLooking at my calculations, the actual counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 1/16 of the population, approximately 6.25%\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype 4: 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n\nBut the options don't have exact fractions. Perhaps the user is simplifying, rounding to whole numbers. For example, if we take 9/16 as 56%, 3/16 as 18.75%, etc., but none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of thinking in terms of percentages, perhaps the options are giving counts, so let's see.\n\nIf the F2 is 16 individuals (assuming parents are selfed), then:\n\nTotal possible genotypes: 16\n\nPhenotype 1 (both dominant): 1 (CC BB, CcBB, ccBB) \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let's recount:\n\nFrom the F2 list earlier:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 1 )\n- CcBB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 2 )\n- ccBB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 3 )\n- CcBB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 2 )\n- ccBB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 3 )\n- CCbb \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 1 )\n- Ccbb \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 2 )\n- ccbb \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 4 )\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Perhaps it's better to create a Punnett square for F2.\n\nLet me construct the F2 Punnett square:\n\n       | C c   | c B   | c b\n-------|--------|--------|-------\n       C | CC BB | Cc BB | Cc bb \n-------|--------|--------|--------\n       c | Cc BB | cc BB | cc bb \n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The F2 individuals are produced by the selfing of F1 (CcBb), so the Punnett square should reflect all possible combinations.\n\nActually, the F2 square would be:\n\n          | C c | c B | c b\n----------|-----|----|----\n        C | CC BB | Cc BB | Cc bb \n      c B | Cc BB | cc BB | cc bb \n      c b | Cc BB | cc BB | cc bb \n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n1. Phenotype 1 (both dominant): Only CC BB \u2192 1 bird\n2. Phenotype 2 (C dominant, B absent): Cc BB, Cc bb \u2192 2 birds\n3. Phenotype 3 (C absent, B dominant): cc BB, cc bb \u2192 2 birds\n4. Phenotype 4 (both absent): cc BB, cc bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nWait, no\u2014that seems off. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 phenotype 1 (red and brown)\n- Cc BB \u2192 phenotype 2 (red and brown)\n- Cc bb \u2192 phenotype 2 (red and brown)\n- cc BB \u2192 phenotype 3 (plain and brown)\n- cc bb \u2192 phenotype 4 (plain and brown)\n\nSo, from the grid:\n\nPhenotype 1: 1 bird (CC BB)\nPhenotype 2: 2 birds (Cc BB and Cc bb)\nPhenotype 3: 1 bird (cc BB)\nPhenotype 4: 1 bird (cc bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 5 birds, but that contradicts the expectation of 16 birds. I must be making a mistake here. Let me list all the genotypes:\n\nFrom the F2 grid:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 1 )\n- Cc BB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 2 )\n- Cc bb \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 2 )\n- cc BB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 3 )\n- cc bb \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 4 )\n- Cc BB again? No, I think I miscounted. Wait, the F2 grid includes all possible combinations, so:\n\nPhenotype 1: 1 bird (CC BB)\nPhenotype 2: 2 birds (Cc BB and Cc bb)\nPhenotype 3: 1 bird (cc BB)\nPhenotype 4: 1 bird (cc bb)\n\nAdding up to 5 birds, which is impossible because each F1 (CcBb) produces 4 gametes, and F2 would be 16. So clearly, my earlier analysis is flawed. Let me try a different approach.\n\nInstead of constructing the entire Punnett square, I'll calculate the probabilities directly.\n\nEach bird has two independent genes, so the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of C dominant (red): 3/4 (since C is present in 3/4 of cases)\n- Probability of c recessive (plain): 1/4\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Probability of B dominant (brown): 3/4\n- Probability of b recessive (checkered): 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nPhenotype 1 (C and B dominant): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 56.25%\nPhenotype 2 (C dominant, B recessive): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\nPhenotype 3 (C recessive, B dominant): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\nPhenotype 4 (C recessive, B recessive): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 6.25%\n\nNow, converting these fractions to counts (assuming 16 birds):\n\nPhenotype 1: 9 birds\nPhenotype 2: 3 birds\nPhenotype 3: 3 birds\nPhenotype 4: 1 bird\n\nBut the answer options don't include these numbers. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE.

Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNone of these options match my calculated 9,3,3,1. However, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums up to 16 birds, which matches the expected total. So option C seems to fit.\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, Phenotype 1 (C and B) is 9/16, which is 9 birds, and Phenotype 2 (C dominant, B recessive) is 3, and Phenotype 3 (C recessive, B dominant) is 3, and Phenotype 4 (both recessive) is 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c recessive, B recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, if a bird is CcBB, then it's red and brown. If it's CcBb, it's red and brown (since B is dominant). Similarly, ccBB is plain and brown, ccBb is plain and brown, and ccbb is plain and checkered. Wait, no\u2014if B is recessive (b), then regardless of C, it's checkered. Because in the B locus, B is dominant (brown), so b is recessive (checkered). So, for pigment color (C/c): dominant (C) \u2192 red; recessive (c) \u2192 plain. For body color (B/b): dominant (B) \u2192 brown; recessive (b) \u2192 checkered.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (CcBB or CcBb)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (Ccbb)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (ccBB)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (ccbb)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. Let's calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n- C (dominant) = 25% (from CC)\n- c (recessive) = 25%\n\nFor body color (B):\n- B (dominant) = 25%\n- b (recessive) = 25%\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant):\n\nProbability = (25%) * (25%) = 6.25% \u2192 6.25/100 = 1/16 \u2248 6.25%\n\nBut looking back at the options, option A says checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2. Hmm, but our calculation shows 6.25% for phenotype 1, which isn't exactly listed. Maybe the user made some approximation or rounding. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the phenotypic categories.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider all possible combinations without approximating:\n\nEach bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So, the number of possible phenotypic categories is 2 x 2 = 4, but considering dominance, each category may correspond to multiple genotypic classes.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use a Punnett square where we account for the possible genotypes and then determine the phenotypes.\n\nParental genotypes: CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive).\n\nWhen crossed, the F1 would be CcBb (since each parent contributes CB gametes). So F1 is CcBb.\n\nIn F2 generation, each parent (F1) produces gametes: CB (25%), cb (25%). So the F2 will have four possible gamete combinations:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n3. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n4. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Actually, the F2 would have four possible genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (25%)\n- 25% CcBB (25%)\n- 25% ccBB (25%)\n- 25% CcBb (25%)\n- 25% ccBb (25%)\n- 25% CCbb (25%)\n- 25% Ccbb (25%)\n- 25% ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's overcomplicating. Let me instead use a standard Punnett square for F2 when crossing F1 (CcBb) with itself.\n\nThe F1 (CcBb) can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have 16 possible combinations:\n\n1. CB + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n2. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n3. CB + cB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n4. CB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n5. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n6. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n7. cB + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n8. cB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n9. cB + cB \u2192 ccBB (25%)\n10. cB + cb \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n11. cb + CB \u2192 CcBb (25%)\n12. cb + cb \u2192 ccbb (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I made a mistake. The actual F2 genotypes after selfing F1 (CcBb) are:\n\n- 25% CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% CcBB (from CB + cb)\n- 25% ccBB (from cb + cb)\n- 25% CcBb (from CB + cB)\n- 25% ccBb (from cb + cB)\n- 25% CCbb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% Ccbb (from CB + cb)\n- 25% ccbb (from cb + cb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's still confusing. Let me clarify: Each F1 (CcBb) produces four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each at 25%. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the F2 will have the following possible genotypes and phenotypes:\n\nPhenotype breakdown:\n\n1. Pigment red (C dominant) and brown (B dominant):\n\n   This occurs when C is present and B is present. So any bird with at least one dominant allele for both genes will have this phenotype. Let's count how many F2 individuals fall into this category.\n\n   From the above list, the F2 genotypes are:\n\n   - CC BB \u2192 checkered red\n   - CcBB \u2192 checkered brown\n   - ccBB \u2192 plain red\n   - CcBB \u2192 checkered brown\n   - ccBB \u2192 plain red\n   - CCbb \u2192 plain red\n   - Ccbb \u2192 checkered brown\n   - ccbb \u2192 plain brown\n\n   Wait, no\u2014it's easier to count the number of each phenotype based on the combinations of dominant/recessive alleles.\n\n   For pigment color (C):\n\n   - Present (C): red\n   - Absent (c): plain\n\n   For body color (B):\n\n   - Present (B): brown\n   - Absent (b): checkered\n\n   So, the phenotype is determined by whether each gene is present or absent. To get the phenotype, we combine the two:\n\n   1. Both dominant: red and brown (phenotype 1)\n   2. C dominant, B absent: red and checkered (phenotype 2)\n   3. C absent, B dominant: plain and brown (phenotype 3)\n   4. Both absent: plain and checkered (phenotype 4)\n\n   Now, how many F2 individuals fall into each phenotype?\n\n   Since each gene has two alleles, the probability for each phenotype is calculated as follows:\n\n   - Phenotype 1 (both dominant): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 6.25%\n   - Phenotype 2 (C dominant, B absent): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\n   - Phenotype 3 (C absent, B dominant): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\n   - Phenotype 4 (both absent): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 56.25%\n\n   But none of the answer choices match these percentages directly. Let me look back at the options given:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\n\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\n\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\n\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\n\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\n\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\n\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nLooking at my calculations, the actual counts would be:\n\n- Phenotype 1: 1/16 of the population, approximately 6.25%\n- Phenotype 2: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype 3: 3/16 \u2248 18.75%\n- Phenotype 4: 9/16 \u2248 56.25%\n\nBut the options don't have exact fractions. Perhaps the user is simplifying, rounding to whole numbers. For example, if we take 9/16 as 56%, 3/16 as 18.75%, etc., but none of the options match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes.\n\nWait, another approach: Instead of thinking in terms of percentages, perhaps the options are giving counts, so let's see.\n\nIf the F2 is 16 individuals (assuming parents are selfed), then:\n\nTotal possible genotypes: 16\n\nPhenotype 1 (both dominant): 1 (CC BB, CcBB, ccBB) \u2192 1 bird\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Let's recount:\n\nFrom the F2 list earlier:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 1 )\n- CcBB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 2 )\n- ccBB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 3 )\n- CcBB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 2 )\n- ccBB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 3 )\n- CCbb \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 1 )\n- Ccbb \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 2 )\n- ccbb \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 4 )\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused. Perhaps it's better to create a Punnett square for F2.\n\nLet me construct the F2 Punnett square:\n\n       | C c   | c B   | c b\n-------|--------|--------|-------\n       C | CC BB | Cc BB | Cc bb \n-------|--------|--------|--------\n       c | Cc BB | cc BB | cc bb \n\nWait, no\u2014that's not accurate. The F2 individuals are produced by the selfing of F1 (CcBb), so the Punnett square should reflect all possible combinations.\n\nActually, the F2 square would be:\n\n          | C c | c B | c b\n----------|-----|----|----\n        C | CC BB | Cc BB | Cc bb \n      c B | Cc BB | cc BB | cc bb \n      c b | Cc BB | cc BB | cc bb \n\nNow, counting each phenotype:\n\n1. Phenotype 1 (both dominant): Only CC BB \u2192 1 bird\n2. Phenotype 2 (C dominant, B absent): Cc BB, Cc bb \u2192 2 birds\n3. Phenotype 3 (C absent, B dominant): cc BB, cc bb \u2192 2 birds\n4. Phenotype 4 (both absent): cc BB, cc bb \u2192 2 birds\n\nWait, no\u2014that seems off. Let me re-examine:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 phenotype 1 (red and brown)\n- Cc BB \u2192 phenotype 2 (red and brown)\n- Cc bb \u2192 phenotype 2 (red and brown)\n- cc BB \u2192 phenotype 3 (plain and brown)\n- cc bb \u2192 phenotype 4 (plain and brown)\n\nSo, from the grid:\n\nPhenotype 1: 1 bird (CC BB)\nPhenotype 2: 2 birds (Cc BB and Cc bb)\nPhenotype 3: 1 bird (cc BB)\nPhenotype 4: 1 bird (cc bb)\n\nWait, that adds up to 5 birds, but that contradicts the expectation of 16 birds. I must be making a mistake here. Let me list all the genotypes:\n\nFrom the F2 grid:\n\n- CC BB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 1 )\n- Cc BB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 2 )\n- Cc bb \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 2 )\n- cc BB \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 3 )\n- cc bb \u2192 1 bird ( phenotype 4 )\n- Cc BB again? No, I think I miscounted. Wait, the F2 grid includes all possible combinations, so:\n\nPhenotype 1: 1 bird (CC BB)\nPhenotype 2: 2 birds (Cc BB and Cc bb)\nPhenotype 3: 1 bird (cc BB)\nPhenotype 4: 1 bird (cc bb)\n\nAdding up to 5 birds, which is impossible because each F1 (CcBb) produces 4 gametes, and F2 would be 16. So clearly, my earlier analysis is flawed. Let me try a different approach.\n\nInstead of constructing the entire Punnett square, I'll calculate the probabilities directly.\n\nEach bird has two independent genes, so the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as the product of the probabilities of each gene being dominant.\n\nFor pigment color (C):\n\n- Probability of C dominant (red): 3/4 (since C is present in 3/4 of cases)\n- Probability of c recessive (plain): 1/4\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- Probability of B dominant (brown): 3/4\n- Probability of b recessive (checkered): 1/4\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the combined probabilities are:\n\nPhenotype 1 (C and B dominant): (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u2192 56.25%\nPhenotype 2 (C dominant, B recessive): (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\nPhenotype 3 (C recessive, B dominant): (1/4) * (3/4) = 3/16 \u2192 18.75%\nPhenotype 4 (C recessive, B recessive): (1/4) * (1/4) = 1/16 \u2192 6.25%\n\nNow, converting these fractions to counts (assuming 16 birds):\n\nPhenotype 1: 9 birds\nPhenotype 2: 3 birds\nPhenotype 3: 3 birds\nPhenotype 4: 1 bird\n\nBut the answer options don't include these numbers. Let me check the options again:\n\nA. Checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain red 6, plain brown 2\nB. Checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain red 0, plain brown 4\nC. Checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\nD. Checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3\nE. Checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\nF. Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4\nG. Checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0\nH. Checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6\nI. Checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nNone of these options match my calculated 9,3,3,1. However, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. That sums up to 16 birds, which matches the expected total. So option C seems to fit.\n\nWait, but according to my calculations, Phenotype 1 (C and B) is 9/16, which is 9 birds, and Phenotype 2 (C dominant, B recessive) is 3, and Phenotype 3 (C recessive, B dominant) is 3, and Phenotype 4 (both recessive) is 1. Adding up to 16 birds. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which aligns with my calculations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, when both genes are present, the bird's phenotype depends on whether the dominant allele is active. So for pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, for body color, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (C and B)\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigmented plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigmented plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, to find the phenotypic ratios, we can calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each bird inherits two alleles for each gene, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated using the Punnett square approach.\n\nFor the C locus (gene):\n- Probability of having at least one C (p) = 3/4\n- Probability of being plain (no C) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (gene):\n- Probability of having at least one B (q) = 3/4\n- Probability of being checkered (no B) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the probability of each phenotype is p_C * p_B = (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for red and brown, p_C*(1/4)=3/16 for red and checkered, (1/4)*p_B=3/16 for plain and brown, and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but considering the actual categories, it's 9 (red and brown) : 3 (red and checkered) : 3 (plain and brown) : 1 (plain and checkered). However, looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the options.\n\nThe options provided are A through H, each giving different ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with what I derived. Alternatively, option G suggests checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me re-calculate. The F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross where each parent is heterozygous for both genes (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb). The Punnett square would involve all possible combinations. But in this case, the parents are homozygous, so the F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 selfing would lead to a certain distribution. Wait, no\u2014the initial statement was about the cross involving a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from crossing F1 with itself.\n\nWait, but the user's last part mentions \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" But perhaps I misread the question earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nThe cross described is a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be from F1 selfing. Therefore, the F2 would include the four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, and bb. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the F2 would have the following genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for the B locus: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nAnd for the B locus:\n\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nBut the user might be asking about the phenotypic ratios, which depend on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one C and/or B allele.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Pigmented red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigmented red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Pigmented plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Pigmented plain and checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes can occur in various proportions depending on the number of each genotype.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratios, we need to consider how many individuals in the F2 generation fall into each category. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes along with their phenotypes:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Pigmented red\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 Pigmented red\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Pigmented plain\n- BB (25%) \u2192 Brown\n- Bb (50%) \u2192 Brown\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, but some of these genotypes may combine to create specific phenotypes. For example, CC and Cc have the same phenotype because they both have at least one C allele, regardless of the B allele. Similarly, cc has the phenotype based solely on the B locus.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the probabilities of each genotype and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (C and B present):\n   - Occur when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n   - This includes CC, Cc, Bc, BC (but since C and B are distinct loci, it's better to think in terms of combinations).\n   - In the F2 population, the number of individuals with at least one C and at least one B is calculated by subtracting those without C or without B.\n   - Number without C: 25% (all cc)\n   - Number without B: 25% (all BB)\n   - Number without either C or B: 1% (only bb)\n   - Using inclusion-exclusion principle:\n     - Phenotype without C: only bb (25%)\n     - Phenotype without B: only cc (25%)\n     - Phenotype without C and without B: none (since all are either C/B or c/b, but without both C and B, it's only bb and cc)\n     - Therefore, the phenotype without C or B is 25% (cc) +25% (bb) =50%\n     - So, the phenotype with at least C and B is 100% - 50% =50%\n   - Wait, but this seems off. Let me double-check. Actually, the number of individuals with at least one C and at least one B is calculated as follows:\n\n     Total population: 100%\n\n     Subtract those without C (25%) and without B (25%), but add back those who were subtracted twice (the ones with neither C nor B, which is 0%, since C and B are the only loci).\n\n     So, 100% -25%-25%=50%.\n\n   Therefore, 50% of the F2 population has the phenotype Pigmented red and brown.\n\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C and b present):\n   - Occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one b.\n   - Similarly, using inclusion-exclusion:\n     - Phenotype without B: only cc (25%)\n     - Phenotype without C: only bb (25%)\n     - Phenotype without C or B: none\n     - So, the phenotype with at least C and at least b is 100% -25%-25% =50%\n   - Wait, but this counts all individuals except those with neither C nor B, which are 50%. So yes, 50% of the population has this phenotype.\n\n3. Pigmented plain and brown (c and B present):\n   - Occurs when the bird has at least one c and at least one B.\n   - Again, similar calculation:\n     - Phenotype without B: only cc (25%)\n     - Phenotype without c: only BB (25%)\n     - Phenotype without B and without c: none\n     - So, 100% -25%-25% =50%\n   - Wait, but this counts all individuals except those with neither c nor B, which is 50%. So yes, 50% of the population has this phenotype.\n\n4. Pigmented plain and checkered (c and b present):\n   - Occurs when the bird has at least one c and at least one b.\n   - Calculation:\n     - Phenotype without b: only cc (25%)\n     - Phenotype without c: only BB (25%)\n     - Phenotype without b and without c: none\n     - So, 100% -25%-25% =50%\n   - Therefore, 50% of the population has this phenotype.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because the sum exceeds 100%. Let me recast this.\n\nActually, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of alleles. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 50%\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 50%\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 50%\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 50%\n\nBut this implies that all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case. Because some phenotypes overlap. Wait, no\u2014each phenotype is defined by the presence of at least one allele for each gene. So, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have C and B, C and b, c and B, or c and b. Therefore, the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.\n\nHowever, according to the calculations above, each phenotype would have a frequency of 50%, which adds up to 200%, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake in the approach.\n\nLet me try a different method. Instead of counting the entire population, I'll calculate the expected number of each phenotype by considering the possible combinations of alleles.\n\nEach bird's genotype contributes to their phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's use a Punnett square approach for the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotype for each genotype:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigmented red (has C)\n- Cc \u2192 Pigmented red (has C)\n- cc \u2192 Pigmented plain (has c)\n- BB \u2192 Brown (has B)\n- Bb \u2192 Brown (has B)\n- bb \u2192 Checkered (has b)\n\nNow, we need to count how many of these genotypes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigmented red and brown (C and B present)\n- Genotypes: CC, Cc, BB, Bb\n- Frequency: 25% +50% +25% +50% =150% \u2192 Wait, this can't be right. Wait, no\u2014each genotype contributes to the phenotype based on whether they meet the criteria. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigmented red (has C)\n- Cc \u2192 Pigmented red (has C)\n- BB \u2192 Brown (has B)\n- Bb \u2192 Brown (has B)\n- cc \u2192 Pigmented plain (has c)\n- bb \u2192 Checkered (has b)\n\nSo, the number of individuals with Pigmented red and brown is the sum of CC, Cc, BB, Bb. Their frequencies are 25% +50% +25% +50% =150% \u2192 Wait, that's impossible because the maximum is 100%. I must be overcounting.\n\nWait, no\u2014each genotype represents a specific combination, so:\n\n- CC and Cc together make up 75% of the population (25% +50%)\n- BB and Bb also make up 75% (25% +50%)\n- So, the number of individuals with Pigmented red and brown (both C and B present) is 75% of the population.\n\nSimilarly, the number with Pigmented red and checkered (C and b) is the sum of CC and Cc, but wait, no\u2014because Cc does not have a b allele. Wait, no, Cc has a dominant C allele but a recessive c. So, for Pigmented red and checkered, the genotype must have at least one C and at least one b. But Cc does not have a b allele, so they don't qualify. Therefore, Pigmented red and checkered would be only the individuals who have at least one C and at least one b. Looking at the genotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigmented red, no b \u2192 Not applicable\n- Cc \u2192 Pigmented red, no b \u2192 Not applicable\n- cc \u2192 Pigmented plain, no b \u2192 Not applicable\n- BB \u2192 Brown, no b \u2192 Not applicable\n- Bb \u2192 Brown, has b \u2192 Yes\n- bb \u2192 Checkered, no b \u2192 Not applicable\n\nTherefore, Pigmented red and checkered is only represented by Bb (50%).\n\nSimilarly, Pigmented plain and brown (c and B present) would be CC and Cc (25% +50% =75%).\n\nPigmented plain and checkered (c and b present) would be only cc (25%).\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous calculation. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigmented red and brown (C and B present) \u2192 CC, Cc, BB, Bb \u2192 25% +50% +25% +50% =150% \u2192 This can\u2019t be right. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific set of genotypes, not overlapping. Therefore, I must have misunderstood how the phenotypes are counted.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to see how many genotypes correspond to each phenotype. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigmented red and brown (C and B present) \u2192 25% CC + 50% Cc =75%\nPhenotype 2: Pigmented red and checkered (C and b present) \u2192 25% CC + 50% Cc =75%\nWait, this can't be right because the sum exceeds 100%. I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternative approach: Use a grid to represent all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nCreate a table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype |\n|-----------|------------|\n| CC        | Pigmented red |\n| Cc        | Pigmented red |\n| cc        | Pigmented plain |\n| BB        | Brown      |\n| Bb        | Brown      |\n| bb        | Checkered   |\n\nNow, count how many of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigmented red: CC (25%), Cc (50%) \u2192 Total 75%\n- Pigmented red (wait, but Cc doesn't have a b allele, so shouldn't they be Pigmented red and checkered?)\n- No, wait, Pigmented red requires at least one C. Pigmented red and checkered require at least one C and one b. Pigmented red and brown require at least one C and one B. Pigmented plain and brown require at least one c and one B. Pigmented plain and checkered require at least one c and one b.\n\nTherefore, correcting the table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype          |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| CC        | Pigmented red       |\n| Cc        | Pigmented red       |\n| cc        | Pigmented plain       |\n| BB        | Brown               |\n| Bb        | Brown               |\n| bb        | Checkered           |\n\nNow, count the number of individuals with each phenotype:\n\n- Pigmented red: CC (25%) + Cc (50%) =75%\n- Pigmented red and checkered: Only Bb (50%) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014Bb has a B and a b, so it should be considered Pigmented brown and checkered. Wait, no, Pigmented red requires C, Pigmented red and checkered requires C and b. So Bb would be Pigmented brown and checkered, not Pigmented red and checkered.\n\nAh, here's the confusion. Pigmented red and checkered would require C and b, but Bb does have a B, so it's Pigmented brown and checkered. Therefore:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: CC, Cc, BB, Bb \u2192 25% +50% +25% +50% =150% \u2192 This is wrong. Each individual can only belong to one phenotype. Therefore, my initial approach was flawed.\n\nInstead, let's categorize based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 Pigmented red and brown\n- If the bird has at least one C and at least one b \u2192 Pigmented red and checkered\n- If the bird has at least one c and at least one B \u2192 Pigmented plain and brown\n- If the bird has at least one c and at least one b \u2192 Pigmented plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage of each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (C and B present):\n\n   - Frequency = (CC + Cc + BB + Bb) / 100% \n   - Which is 25% +50% +25% +50% =150% \u2192 This is incorrect because each bird can only fit into one phenotype. Therefore, the correct way is to realize that:\n\n   - The presence of C and B requires that both C and B are present. So, in the F2, the proportion of individuals with both C and B is calculated as follows:\n\n     Using the formula for independent loci: P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u224856.25%\n\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C and b present):\n\n   - Frequency = (",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nWait, but in reality, when both genes are present, the bird's phenotype depends on whether the dominant allele is active. So for pigment color, C is dominant over c, so any bird with at least one C allele will be red. Similarly, for body color, B is dominant over b, so any bird with at least one B allele will be brown.\n\nSo for each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes. Therefore, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (C and B)\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigmented plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigmented plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, to find the phenotypic ratios, we can calculate the proportion of each phenotype in the F2 generation. Since each bird inherits two alleles for each gene, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated using the Punnett square approach.\n\nFor the C locus (gene):\n- Probability of having at least one C (p) = 3/4\n- Probability of being plain (no C) = 1/4\n\nFor the B locus (gene):\n- Probability of having at least one B (q) = 3/4\n- Probability of being checkered (no B) = 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the probability of each phenotype is p_C * p_B = (3/4)*(3/4)=9/16 for red and brown, p_C*(1/4)=3/16 for red and checkered, (1/4)*p_B=3/16 for plain and brown, and (1/4)*(1/4)=1/16 for plain and checkered.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, but considering the actual categories, it's 9 (red and brown) : 3 (red and checkered) : 3 (plain and brown) : 1 (plain and checkered). However, looking at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Let me look back at the options.\n\nThe options provided are A through H, each giving different ratios. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That doesn't align with what I derived. Alternatively, option G suggests checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the probabilities. Let me re-calculate. The F2 generation comes from a dihybrid cross where each parent is heterozygous for both genes (CcBB \u00d7 ccbb). The Punnett square would involve all possible combinations. But in this case, the parents are homozygous, so the F1 would be CcBb, and then F1 selfing would lead to a certain distribution. Wait, no\u2014the initial statement was about the cross involving a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would come from crossing F1 with itself.\n\nWait, but the user's last part mentions \"for this cross, show the expected phenotypes, genotypes, genotypic frequencies, and phenotypic ratios for the F2 generation.\" But perhaps I misread the question earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nThe cross described is a dihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the F1 would be CcBb, and the F2 would be from F1 selfing. Therefore, the F2 would include the four possible genotypes: CC, Cc, cc, BB, Bb, and bb. Wait, no\u2014it's a dihybrid cross, so the F2 would have the following genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%). Similarly for the B locus: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). So the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC\n- 50% Cc\n- 25% cc\n\nAnd for the B locus:\n\n- 25% BB\n- 50% Bb\n- 25% bb\n\nBut the user might be asking about the phenotypic ratios, which depend on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. So for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have at least one C and/or B allele.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C and B \u2192 Pigmented red and brown\n2. C and b \u2192 Pigmented red and checkered\n3. c and B \u2192 Pigmented plain and brown\n4. c and b \u2192 Pigmented plain and checkered\n\nEach of these phenotypes can occur in various proportions depending on the number of each genotype.\n\nTo calculate the phenotypic ratios, we need to consider how many individuals in the F2 generation fall into each category. Let's list all possible F2 genotypes along with their phenotypes:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Pigmented red\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 Pigmented red\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Pigmented plain\n- BB (25%) \u2192 Brown\n- Bb (50%) \u2192 Brown\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Checkered\n\nWait, but some of these genotypes may combine to create specific phenotypes. For example, CC and Cc have the same phenotype because they both have at least one C allele, regardless of the B allele. Similarly, cc has the phenotype based solely on the B locus.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to calculate the frequency of each phenotype based on the probabilities of each genotype and their corresponding phenotypes.\n\nLet's compute the probabilities for each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (C and B present):\n   - Occur when the bird has at least one C and at least one B.\n   - This includes CC, Cc, Bc, BC (but since C and B are distinct loci, it's better to think in terms of combinations).\n   - In the F2 population, the number of individuals with at least one C and at least one B is calculated by subtracting those without C or without B.\n   - Number without C: 25% (all cc)\n   - Number without B: 25% (all BB)\n   - Number without either C or B: 1% (only bb)\n   - Using inclusion-exclusion principle:\n     - Phenotype without C: only bb (25%)\n     - Phenotype without B: only cc (25%)\n     - Phenotype without C and without B: none (since all are either C/B or c/b, but without both C and B, it's only bb and cc)\n     - Therefore, the phenotype without C or B is 25% (cc) +25% (bb) =50%\n     - So, the phenotype with at least C and B is 100% - 50% =50%\n   - Wait, but this seems off. Let me double-check. Actually, the number of individuals with at least one C and at least one B is calculated as follows:\n\n     Total population: 100%\n\n     Subtract those without C (25%) and without B (25%), but add back those who were subtracted twice (the ones with neither C nor B, which is 0%, since C and B are the only loci).\n\n     So, 100% -25%-25%=50%.\n\n   Therefore, 50% of the F2 population has the phenotype Pigmented red and brown.\n\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C and b present):\n   - Occurs when the bird has at least one C and at least one b.\n   - Similarly, using inclusion-exclusion:\n     - Phenotype without B: only cc (25%)\n     - Phenotype without C: only bb (25%)\n     - Phenotype without C or B: none\n     - So, the phenotype with at least C and at least b is 100% -25%-25% =50%\n   - Wait, but this counts all individuals except those with neither C nor B, which are 50%. So yes, 50% of the population has this phenotype.\n\n3. Pigmented plain and brown (c and B present):\n   - Occurs when the bird has at least one c and at least one B.\n   - Again, similar calculation:\n     - Phenotype without B: only cc (25%)\n     - Phenotype without c: only BB (25%)\n     - Phenotype without B and without c: none\n     - So, 100% -25%-25% =50%\n   - Wait, but this counts all individuals except those with neither c nor B, which is 50%. So yes, 50% of the population has this phenotype.\n\n4. Pigmented plain and checkered (c and b present):\n   - Occurs when the bird has at least one c and at least one b.\n   - Calculation:\n     - Phenotype without b: only cc (25%)\n     - Phenotype without c: only BB (25%)\n     - Phenotype without b and without c: none\n     - So, 100% -25%-25% =50%\n   - Therefore, 50% of the population has this phenotype.\n\nWait, but this can't be right because the sum exceeds 100%. Let me recast this.\n\nActually, each phenotype corresponds to a specific combination of alleles. So:\n\nPhenotype 1: C and B \u2192 50%\nPhenotype 2: C and b \u2192 50%\nPhenotype 3: c and B \u2192 50%\nPhenotype 4: c and b \u2192 50%\n\nBut this implies that all phenotypes are equally likely, which isn't the case. Because some phenotypes overlap. Wait, no\u2014each phenotype is defined by the presence of at least one allele for each gene. So, for each bird, the phenotype is determined by whether they have C and B, C and b, c and B, or c and b. Therefore, the four phenotypes are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.\n\nHowever, according to the calculations above, each phenotype would have a frequency of 50%, which adds up to 200%, which is impossible. I must have made a mistake in the approach.\n\nLet me try a different method. Instead of counting the entire population, I'll calculate the expected number of each phenotype by considering the possible combinations of alleles.\n\nEach bird's genotype contributes to their phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles. Let's use a Punnett square approach for the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nSimilarly for the B locus:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotype for each genotype:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigmented red (has C)\n- Cc \u2192 Pigmented red (has C)\n- cc \u2192 Pigmented plain (has c)\n- BB \u2192 Brown (has B)\n- Bb \u2192 Brown (has B)\n- bb \u2192 Checkered (has b)\n\nNow, we need to count how many of these genotypes correspond to each phenotype.\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigmented red and brown (C and B present)\n- Genotypes: CC, Cc, BB, Bb\n- Frequency: 25% +50% +25% +50% =150% \u2192 Wait, this can't be right. Wait, no\u2014each genotype contributes to the phenotype based on whether they meet the criteria. So:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigmented red (has C)\n- Cc \u2192 Pigmented red (has C)\n- BB \u2192 Brown (has B)\n- Bb \u2192 Brown (has B)\n- cc \u2192 Pigmented plain (has c)\n- bb \u2192 Checkered (has b)\n\nSo, the number of individuals with Pigmented red and brown is the sum of CC, Cc, BB, Bb. Their frequencies are 25% +50% +25% +50% =150% \u2192 Wait, that's impossible because the maximum is 100%. I must be overcounting.\n\nWait, no\u2014each genotype represents a specific combination, so:\n\n- CC and Cc together make up 75% of the population (25% +50%)\n- BB and Bb also make up 75% (25% +50%)\n- So, the number of individuals with Pigmented red and brown (both C and B present) is 75% of the population.\n\nSimilarly, the number with Pigmented red and checkered (C and b) is the sum of CC and Cc, but wait, no\u2014because Cc does not have a b allele. Wait, no, Cc has a dominant C allele but a recessive c. So, for Pigmented red and checkered, the genotype must have at least one C and at least one b. But Cc does not have a b allele, so they don't qualify. Therefore, Pigmented red and checkered would be only the individuals who have at least one C and at least one b. Looking at the genotypes:\n\n- CC \u2192 Pigmented red, no b \u2192 Not applicable\n- Cc \u2192 Pigmented red, no b \u2192 Not applicable\n- cc \u2192 Pigmented plain, no b \u2192 Not applicable\n- BB \u2192 Brown, no b \u2192 Not applicable\n- Bb \u2192 Brown, has b \u2192 Yes\n- bb \u2192 Checkered, no b \u2192 Not applicable\n\nTherefore, Pigmented red and checkered is only represented by Bb (50%).\n\nSimilarly, Pigmented plain and brown (c and B present) would be CC and Cc (25% +50% =75%).\n\nPigmented plain and checkered (c and b present) would be only cc (25%).\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous calculation. Let me clarify:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigmented red and brown (C and B present) \u2192 CC, Cc, BB, Bb \u2192 25% +50% +25% +50% =150% \u2192 This can\u2019t be right. Each phenotype corresponds to a specific set of genotypes, not overlapping. Therefore, I must have misunderstood how the phenotypes are counted.\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to see how many genotypes correspond to each phenotype. For example:\n\nPhenotype 1: Pigmented red and brown (C and B present) \u2192 25% CC + 50% Cc =75%\nPhenotype 2: Pigmented red and checkered (C and b present) \u2192 25% CC + 50% Cc =75%\nWait, this can't be right because the sum exceeds 100%. I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternative approach: Use a grid to represent all possible F2 genotypes and their phenotypes.\n\nCreate a table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype |\n|-----------|------------|\n| CC        | Pigmented red |\n| Cc        | Pigmented red |\n| cc        | Pigmented plain |\n| BB        | Brown      |\n| Bb        | Brown      |\n| bb        | Checkered   |\n\nNow, count how many of each phenotype:\n\n- Pigmented red: CC (25%), Cc (50%) \u2192 Total 75%\n- Pigmented red (wait, but Cc doesn't have a b allele, so shouldn't they be Pigmented red and checkered?)\n- No, wait, Pigmented red requires at least one C. Pigmented red and checkered require at least one C and one b. Pigmented red and brown require at least one C and one B. Pigmented plain and brown require at least one c and one B. Pigmented plain and checkered require at least one c and one b.\n\nTherefore, correcting the table:\n\n| Genotype | Phenotype          |\n|-----------|---------------------|\n| CC        | Pigmented red       |\n| Cc        | Pigmented red       |\n| cc        | Pigmented plain       |\n| BB        | Brown               |\n| Bb        | Brown               |\n| bb        | Checkered           |\n\nNow, count the number of individuals with each phenotype:\n\n- Pigmented red: CC (25%) + Cc (50%) =75%\n- Pigmented red and checkered: Only Bb (50%) \u2192 Wait, no\u2014Bb has a B and a b, so it should be considered Pigmented brown and checkered. Wait, no, Pigmented red requires C, Pigmented red and checkered requires C and b. So Bb would be Pigmented brown and checkered, not Pigmented red and checkered.\n\nAh, here's the confusion. Pigmented red and checkered would require C and b, but Bb does have a B, so it's Pigmented brown and checkered. Therefore:\n\n- Pigmented red and brown: CC, Cc, BB, Bb \u2192 25% +50% +25% +50% =150% \u2192 This is wrong. Each individual can only belong to one phenotype. Therefore, my initial approach was flawed.\n\nInstead, let's categorize based on the presence of dominant alleles:\n\n- If the bird has at least one C and at least one B \u2192 Pigmented red and brown\n- If the bird has at least one C and at least one b \u2192 Pigmented red and checkered\n- If the bird has at least one c and at least one B \u2192 Pigmented plain and brown\n- If the bird has at least one c and at least one b \u2192 Pigmented plain and checkered\n\nNow, let's calculate the percentage of each phenotype:\n\n1. Pigmented red and brown (C and B present):\n\n   - Frequency = (CC + Cc + BB + Bb) / 100% \n   - Which is 25% +50% +25% +50% =150% \u2192 This is incorrect because each bird can only fit into one phenotype. Therefore, the correct way is to realize that:\n\n   - The presence of C and B requires that both C and B are present. So, in the F2, the proportion of individuals with both C and B is calculated as follows:\n\n     Using the formula for independent loci: P(C) * P(B) = (3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16 \u224856.25%\n\n2. Pigmented red and checkered (C and b present):\n\n   - Frequency = (",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1.

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4.

So let's list all possible combinations:\n\n- C (dominant) and B (dominant): red and brown \u2192 checkered red-brown?\nWait, the problem states that the checkered pattern is controlled by the recessive allele c, and the plain color is determined by c. Similarly, red is dominant C, brown is dominant B. So the phenotype depends on whether the bird has either dominant or recessive alleles for each gene.\n\nSo, for pigment color (C/c):\n- C_: Pigment red\n- cc_: Plain (checkered)\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n- BB_: Brown\n- Bb_: Checkered\n- bb_: Plain\n\nBut the problem says that the checkered pattern is determined by c, which is recessive, and plain by c. So for pigment, C is dominant (red), c is recessive (plain). For body color, B is dominant (brown), b is recessive (plain). So the phenotype for each trait is determined by whether the bird has at least one dominant allele. \n\nNow, the possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. Each trait can be expressed or not, depending on the presence of dominant alleles. So the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown \u2192 if both C and B are dominant.\n2.

Pigment plain and plain \u2192 if both C and b are recessive, and both B and b are recessive.\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would correspond to how often each of these four phenotypes appears in the F2 generation.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probability for each phenotype is the product of the probabilities of each trait being expressed or not.\n\nLet's calculate the probabilities for each trait:\n\nFor pigment color (C/c):\n- Probability of Pigment red (C_) = 3/4\n- Probability of Plain (cc) = 1/4\n\nFor body color (B/b):\n- Probability of Brown (BB or Bb) = 3/4\n- Probability of Plain (bb) = 1/4\n\nThe four phenotypes' probabilities are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown: Both C_ and B_. Prob = 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n2. Pigment red and plain: C_ and bb. Prob = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n3. Pigment plain and brown: cc and B_. Prob = 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n4. Pigment plain and plain: cc and bb. Prob = 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nAdding them up: 9+3+3+1=16 \u2192 Correct.\n\nNow, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio among the options given.

Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if C recessive, B recessive)\n\nNow, the actual ratios would depend on the distribution of each gene. Since each parent contributes gametes based on their genotype:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, all F1 (CcBb) would produce CB and cb gametes equally (since each parent is homozygous). Thus, in F2:\n\n- For the C locus: probability of C present (red) is 100%, because all gametes have C.\n- For the B locus: probability of B present (brown) is 100%, because all gametes have B.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because then all F2 would have both C and B dominant, leading to the highest phenotype. But according to the options given, none of them say 100% red and brown. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the F1 production. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes, and Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So F1 is CcBb, which produces CB and cb gametes in equal proportions (50% each).\n\nWhen F1 (CcBb) selfs:\n\n- Gametes from Parent 1: CB (50%)\n- Gametes from Parent 2: cb (50%)\n\nSo F2 genotypes are formed by combining these:\n\n- CB + CB = CC (C and c)\n- CB + cb = Cc (C and c)\n- cb + CB = Cc\n- cb + cb = cc\n\nBut considering the independent assortment, each combination is 25%:\n\n- CC (25%)\n- Cc (50%)\n- cc (25%)\n\nNow, translating this into phenotypes:\n\n- CC: C dominant (red) and B dominant (brown) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc: C dominant (red) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain red\n- cC: same as above \u2192 Plain red (wait, no, Cc is still red)\n- cc: c recessive (plain) and B recessive (checkered) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratios would be:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 50%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nWait, but that adds up to 100%. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That seems off because it suggests 12+2=14 vs 2+0=2, which doesn't add up. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That sums to 16, which is less than 100. Option D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Again, 16. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also 16. Option A: 6+2=8, 6+2=8, totals 16. Option B: 8+4=12, 2+4=6, totals 18. Option C: 9+3+3=15, 1+3+1=5, totals 20. Option J: 2+6=8, 3+1=4, totals 12. Option F: 4+4=8, 0+4=4, totals 12. Option I: 7+5=12, 1+3=4, totals 16.\n\nNone of the options seem to sum to 100%. Wait, did I miscalculate?\n\nWait, let me go back. The F2 genotypes after selfing F1 (CcBb):\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc (50%) \u2192 Plain red\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Plain brown\n\nEach of these would correspond to specific phenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red (dominant C and B)\n- Cc: Plain red (only C, B recessive)\n- cC: Same as Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- cc: Plain brown (both recessive)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratios are:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Plain red: 50%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nLooking at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That doesn't match my calculation. Option F says checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. That adds to 16. Option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Still 16. Option E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That adds to 16. None of the options seem to represent 25%, 50%, 25%.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance. Let me double-check the dominance hierarchy. For pigment color (C):\n\n- C is dominant \u2192 red\n- c is recessive \u2192 plain\n\nFor body color (B):\n\n- B is dominant \u2192 brown\n- b is recessive \u2192 checkered\n\nSo, the phenotype is determined by whether the alleles are dominant or recessive for each gene. The possible combinations are:\n\n1. C (red) and B (brown): Checkered red\n2. C (red) and b (checkered): Plain red\n3. c (plain) and B (brown): Plain brown\n4. c (plain) and b (checkered): Checkered brown\n\nIn F2, the genotypes are:\n\n- CC (Checkered red)\n- Cc (Plain red)\n- cC (Same as Cc \u2192 Plain red)\n- cc (Checkered brown)\n\nThe phenotypes are:\n\n- CC \u2192 Checkered red\n- Cc \u2192 Plain red\n- cc \u2192 Checkered brown\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio should be 25% Checkered red, 50% Plain red, 25% Checkered brown.\n\nLooking at the options again, none directly reflect this except perhaps option F, where all are equal at 4 each, totaling 16. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the options consider different dominance rules or some other factor. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers that the F2 generation includes the F1 as well, but I thought F2 refers to the next generation after F1, i.e., the progeny of F1 \u00d7 F1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong regarding the parents' genotypes. Let me verify:\n\nParent 1 is homozygous checkered red: CC BB. So both C and B are dominant.\n\nParent 2 is homozygous plain brown: cc bb. So both c and b are recessive.\n\nWhen crossed, F1 (CcBb) would produce gametes CB and cb equally.\n\nThen, F1 \u00d7 F1 would produce F2 with the following genotypes:\n\n- CC (25%), Cc (50%), cc (25%).\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- CC: Checkered red\n- Cc: Plain red\n- cc: Checkered brown\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio should be 25% Checkered red, 50% Plain red, 25% Checkered brown.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\n- A: 6,2,6,2 \u2192 16\n- B:8,4,2,4\u219218\n- C:9,3,3,1\u219216\n- D:1,3,9,3\u219216\n- E:3,9,1,3\u219216\n- F:4,4,4,4\u219216\n- G:12,2,2,0\u219216\n- H:5,3,2,6\u219216\n- I:7,5,1,3\u219216\n\nNone of these options match exactly 25%, 50%, 25%. Perhaps the options are simplified, treating each F2 generation as having 4 possible phenotypes with equal counts, but that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the answer intended to use a different approach, such as considering the number of viable offspring without considering viability (i.e., ignoring survival rates). In that case, each F2 bird would survive, so the ratios would remain as 25%, 50%, 25%. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest would be option F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4. But this implies 16 birds, which contradicts the earlier calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the options are presented differently, like counting heads instead of the number of birds. For example, if each bird has 4 legs, then the counts would scale accordingly. Let's see:\n\nIf the F2 generation has 16 birds, but the options don't align with that, perhaps scaling isn't considered. Alternatively, perhaps the options assume that each bird has a certain number of legs, but without explicit scaling, it's unclear. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to pick the option that most closely matches the expected 25-50-25 split. Among the options, option F is the only one where each phenotype is represented equally (4 each), totaling 16, which could be interpreted as 25% for each. However, strictly speaking, the correct ratio should be 25% Checkered red, 50% Plain red, 25% Checkered brown. Since none of the options perfectly reflect this, perhaps the intended answer is option F, assuming equal representation across all phenotypes, even though mathematically it shouldn't be exact.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question assumes that the F2 generation consists of the F1 and F2, but I think the standard approach is to refer to the F2 generation as the progeny of F1 \u00d7 F1. Therefore, sticking with the 25-50-25 ratio, the best approximation among the options is option F, despite it not being entirely accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled incorrectly, and the actual count is different, but without further information, I'll proceed with option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb.

But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if C recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if C recessive, B recessive)\n\nNow, the actual ratios would depend on the distribution of each gene. Since each parent contributes gametes based on their genotype:\n\nParent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes.\n\nParent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes.\n\nTherefore, all F1 (CcBb) would produce CB and cb gametes equally (since each parent is homozygous).

But according to the options given, none of them say 100% red and brown. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-express the F1 production.

Since none of the options perfectly reflect this, perhaps the intended answer is option F, assuming equal representation across all phenotypes, even though mathematically it shouldn't be exact.\n\nAnother possibility is that the question assumes that the F2 generation consists of the F1 and F2, but I think the standard approach is to refer to the F2 generation as the progeny of F1 \u00d7 F1. Therefore, sticking with the 25-50-25 ratio, the best approximation among the options is option F, despite it not being entirely accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the options are scaled incorrectly, and the actual count is different, but without further information, I'll proceed with option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, B recessive)\n3. Plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Plain and checkered (if c recessive, B recessive)\n\nBut wait, dominance applies to each trait separately. If C is dominant, then C/B would express as red and brown respectively. Similarly, c/b would express as plain and checkered.\n\nSo the phenotypes can be:\n\n- Red and Brown (C_B_)\n- Red and Checkered (C_bb)\n- Plain and Brown (cc_B_)\n- Plain and Checkered (cc_bb)\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each phenotype. Since the genes are independent, the probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene.\n\nLet's compute the probability for each phenotype:\n\n1. Red and Brown (C_B_):\n   - Probability of C being present (C_: 3/4)\n   - Probability of B being present (B_: 3/4)\n   - Combined probability: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\nWait, no, because each bird is determined by both genes. Actually, the bird's phenotype depends on whether each gene contributes the dominant or recessive allele. Since both genes are expressed together, the combined phenotype is determined by both traits. So, the actual probabilities are computed as follows:\n\nEach gene has a 50% chance of contributing the dominant or recessive allele due to being homozygous. Wait, no\u2014if the bird is homozygous, say, CC BB, then both alleles are dominant, so the bird would be red and brown. Similarly, cc bb would be plain and checkered.\n\nWait, but the bird's genotype affects both traits. So, for each trait, the bird's phenotype depends on whether the allele is dominant or recessive. Since both parents are homozygous (one for each gene), their F1 would also be homozygous, leading to a 25% chance of each possible genotype. Then, the F2 would follow Mendel's laws.\n\nBut let's clarify the F1 and F2:\n\nParent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant for both genes)\nParent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive for both genes)\n\nWhen they mate (adihybrid cross), the F1 would be CcBb (since each parent can only contribute either CB or cb gametes, but since they're homozygous, F1 is CcBb).\n\nThen, F1 selfs (F2 generation):\n\nThe possible gametes from F1 are CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nThus, the F2 genotypes would be:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nNow, let's determine the phenotypes for each genotype:\n\n1. CC (red pigment, dominant) and BB (brown color, dominant):\n   - Phenotype: Red and Brown\n\n2. CC (red) and Bb (checkered, recessive for B):\n   - Phenotype: Red and Checkered\n\n3. cc (plain, recessive for C) and BB (brown):\n   - Phenotype: Plain and Brown\n\n4. cc (plain) and Bb (checkered):\n   - Phenotype: Plain and Checkered\n\nNow, let's compute the probability for each phenotype:\n\n- Red and Brown: Occurs when both C is dominant and B is dominant.\n   - Probability for C: 3/4 (since C is dominant, any C allele makes it red)\n   - Probability for B: 3/4 (any B allele makes it brown)\n   - Combined probability: 3/4 * 3/4 = 9/16\n\n- Red and Checkered: C dominant (3/4) and B recessive (1/4)\n   - Combined probability: 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16\n\n- Plain and Brown: c recessive (1/4) and B dominant (3/4)\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 3/4 = 3/16\n\n- Plain and Checkered: c recessive (1/4) and B recessive (1/4)\n   - Combined probability: 1/4 * 1/4 = 1/16\n\nWait, but this doesn't add up to 1. Let's see: 9/16 + 3/16 + 3/16 + 1/16 = 16/16 = 1. Okay, that checks out.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is:\n\n- Red and Brown : 9\n- Red and Checkered : 3\n- Plain and Brown : 3\n- Plain and Checkered : 1\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption G: Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 This matches our calculation.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the question. The question mentions \"checkered red\" and \"plain red,\" etc. Let me confirm what the colors mean:\n\n- Checkered: plain and brown \u2192 Checkered red?\nNo, wait: In the problem statement:\n\n- Red color is controlled by dominant gene C\n- Plain color is determined by recessive allele c\n\n- Brown color is controlled by dominant gene B\n- Brown color is determined by dominant allele B\n\nSo, for each bird:\n\n- If C is present (C_), it's red.\n- If C is absent (c_), it's plain.\nSimilarly,\n\n- B: Present (B_) \u2192 brown\n- B absent (b_) \u2192 checkered\n\nTherefore, the phenotypes are combinations of these:\n\n1. C_ and B_: Red and Brown \u2192 Red Brown\n2.

Therefore, the phenotypic ratio for F2 is 9:3:3:1, corresponding to the options listed. Looking at option G, the ratio is 9 (Checkered Red?), but wait, in my calculations, checkered refers to plain and brown, which is represented as Plain Brown. Wait, the options might use different terminology.

Similarly, \"plain red\" would refer to Plain and red. Therefore, the correct ratio is 9:3:3:1, where:\n\n- 9: Plain Brown (checkered red)\n- 3: Red Checkered (red brown)\n- 3: Plain Brown (plain red)\n- 1: Plain Checkered (red brown?)\n\nWait, no, let me get this straight. From the options:\n\nOption G: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nWhich corresponds to:\n\n- Checkered Red \u2192 Plain Brown (1)\n- Checkered Brown \u2192 Red Brown (2)\n- Plain Red \u2192 Plain Red (3)\n- Plain Brown \u2192 Red Brown (4)\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the terms are reversed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options are mislabeled. Let me consider that \"checkered\" refers to the phenotype where both C and B are recessive (i.e., c and b), hence checkered. \"Plain\" refers to c and B (no C, dominant B). \"Red\" refers to C and B (dominant). \"Brown\" refers to c and b (recessive B).\n\nGiven that, the phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_ B_: Red and Brown\n2. C_ b_: Red and Checkered\n3. c_ B_: Plain and Brown\n4. c_ b_: Plain and Checkered\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- Red and Brown: 9/16\n- Red and Checkered: 3/16\n- Plain and Brown: 3/16\n- Plain and Checkered: 1/16\n\nTherefore, translating to the options:\n\n- checkered red could be Plain Brown (phenotype 3)\n- checkered brown could be Plain Red (phenotype 4)\n- plain red could be Plain Brown (wait, no, that's same as above)\nWait, this isn't adding up. Maybe the options are incorrectly labeled. Alternatively, perhaps the options are using the term \"checkered\" differently, such as when both C and B are recessive (c and b), resulting in a checkered appearance, but in reality, when both are recessive, it's considered checkered, regardless of the other traits.\n\nIn that case, the phenotype \"checkered red\" would correspond to c_ B_, which is 1/16.\n\nSimilarly, \"checkered brown\" would be c_ bb, which is 3/16.\n\n\"Plain red\" would be cc B_, which is 3/16.\n\n\"Plain brown\" would be cc bb, which is 1/16.\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be:\n\n- checkered red: 1\n- checkered brown: 3\n- plain red: 3\n- plain brown: 1\n\nThis matches option G.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, but how many distinct phenotypes are there? Let's see: For pigment color, C is dominant over c, so possible are red or plain. For body color, B is dominant over b, so possible are brown or checkered. So the phenotypes are combinations of these, leading to four possible phenotypes:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C and B dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C dominant, b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nNow, the question is asking for the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation. So, what do we expect?\n\nEach gene has a 3:1 ratio in terms of occurrence: for example, pigment color has a 3:1 ratio (dominant:recessive), same for body color. But since the genes are independent, the combined ratio would be 9:3:3:1, where each term represents a specific combination of the two traits.\n\nSo, the possible phenotypic ratios would be distributed as follows:\n\n- 9:3:3:1\n\nBut let me confirm. Each gene contributes a ratio of 3:1, and since the genes are independent, the overall ratio is 3\u00d73=9 for the first two categories, then another 3\u00d71=3, then 1\u00d73=3, and finally 1\u00d71=1. So the actual distribution would be:\n\n- 9 cases where pigment is dominant and body is dominant (red and brown)\n- 3 cases where pigment is dominant but body is recessive (red and checkered)\n- 3 cases where pigment is recessive but body is dominant (plain and brown)\n- 1 case where both are recessive (plain and checkered)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nLooking back at the options given:\n\nOption H says: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Not matching.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 Hmm, doesn't fit.\n\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 Doesn't match.\n\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 This seems like 9:3:3:1 scaled up. If we assume that the number of birds is such that each category has 9, 3, 3, 1 counts respectively, then option D would represent 9:3:3:1 scaled by dividing each count by 3. Because 9/3=3, 3/3=1, 3/3=1, 1/3\u22480.333. But that doesn't quite add up. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are different. Let me calculate the expected ratios based on the F2 generation.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the probability of each phenotype can be calculated as follows:\n\n- For pigment color (C):\n  - Dominant (C): 3/4\n  - Recessive (c): 1/4\n\n- For body color (B):\n  - Dominant (B): 3/4\n  - Recessive (b): 1/4\n\nSince the genes are independent, the probabilities combine multiplicatively:\n\n1. Both dominant (C and B): (3/4)(3/4)=9/16\n2. Pigment dominant, body recessive: (3/4)(1/4)=3/16\n3. Pigment recessive, body dominant: (1/4)(3/4)=3/16\n4. Both recessive: (1/4)(1/4)=1/16\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratios are 9:3:3:1 across the board. Now, looking at the options provided, none directly state this. Let me review the options again.\n\nWait, option H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 This suggests that checkered red is 3, checkered brown 9, etc., which aligns with the 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering each category as separate. For example, if each phenotype category is considered individually, the counts could be 9, 3, 3, 1. So, if we take 9 as checkered red, 3 as checkered brown, etc., that matches option H. But option H states \"checkered red 5\", which might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the counts are scaled differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question considers only the non-checkered phenotypes. Wait, but the options seem to mix the counts across categories. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nLooking back:\n\nOptions A-F: These describe phenotypic ratios in parts (like 6, 2, etc.). Option H mentions 5, 3, 2, 6, which don't add up to 16 (total expected). Similarly, option D is 1,3,9,3, adding to 16. So, option D has the sum of 1+3+9+3=16, which fits the 9:3:3:1 ratio if each part is divided by 16, but that would make them fractions, not whole numbers. Alternatively, maybe each category is represented by a certain number, such as 9:3:3:1.\n\nGiven that, option D would correspond to 9:3:3:1 if each category is multiplied by 1, making 9:3:3:1, but the way the options are phrased is confusing. For example, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That adds up to 16 birds, which makes sense because the denominator is 16. So, in terms of proportion, it's 1/16, 3/16, 9/16, 3/16, which simplifies to 1:3:9:3. But the options list them as checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3, which corresponds exactly to the 9:3:3:1 ratio. Thus, option D is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, no\u2014that's the case when both parents are heterozygous. Here, the parents are homozygous, so the F2 will have different ratios.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When both parents are homozygous (for example, CC and cc), their F1 will all be Cc, and then the F2 will follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio, except that the actual phenotypic ratio depends on whether the traits are codominant or additive. In this case, both traits are codominant, so the F2 phenotypic ratio will be 1:1:1:1, but adjusted for dominance. However, in our case, since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will have specific phenotypes based on the combination of C and B alleles.\n\nSo let's compute the probabilities:\n\nEach bird will express the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant (C_B_), which results in red and brown.\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C_bb), which results in red and checkered.\n3. c dominant, B dominant (cc_B_), which results in plain and brown.\n4. Both c and b (cc_bb), which results in plain and checkered.\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is calculated based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), their F2 will inherit one allele from each parent for each gene. Let's consider each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFor Gene C (pigment):\n\n- Parent 1 (CC) contributes C always.\n- Parent 2 (cc) contributes c always.\n- Therefore, F2 for C: 50% C (red), 50% c (plain).\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n\n- Parent 1 (BB) contributes B always.\n- Parent 2 (bb) contributes b always.\n- Therefore, F2 for B: 50% B (brown), 50% b (checkered).\n\nAssuming independence between genes, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the overall F2 phenotypic ratio is:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_B_ = (C)(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\nPhenotype 2: C_bb = (C)(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\nPhenotype 3: cc_B_ = (c)(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\nPhenotype 4: cc_bb = (c)(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nBut wait, that's 100%, but the way the options are given, they seem to expect four phenotypes with counts. So the expected phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but looking back at the options, none of them exactly say that. Instead, some options group them into checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting us to categorize based on the combination of pigmentation and body color, rather than each gene alone. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't 1:1:1:1 due to the dominance relationships. Let me double-check. If both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), the F1 will all be CcBb. Then, the F2 will be CcBb selfing. So, the F2 will have four possible genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), and bb (25%). Wait, no\u2014it's four phenotypic classes based on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering each gene separately and then combining them. Let's do that.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- C is dominant: red\n- c is recessive: plain\n\nThe F2 for C will be:\n\n- 50% C (red)\n- 50% c (plain)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- B is dominant: brown\n- b is recessive: checkered\n\nF2 for B will be:\n\n- 50% B (brown)\n- 50% b (checkered)\n\nAssuming independence, the combined phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: (Red and Brown)\n2. C_bb: (Red and Checkered)\n3. cc_B_: (Plain and Brown)\n4. cc_bb: (Plain and Checkered)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect that directly. Looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems off. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That also doesn't fit. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the presence of at least one dominant allele for either gene leads to a particular phenotype, overriding the others. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are grouped differently. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio after F2. Let me calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nIn F2, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nEach has a 25% chance, so in a population of N individuals, each phenotype occurs N/4 times. But the answer choices suggest grouping into two checkered and two plain colors. Perhaps the question is asking for the proportion within each class, regardless of the order. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each type without considering dominance beyond what's stated.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to recognize that each gene is controlled by a separate pair of loci, and thus the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both traits. However, without dominance overrides, each combination is distinct. But given that the options provided don't match a 1:1:1:1 ratio, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore dominance and simply count the number of each phenotype based on the possible combinations of alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the actual phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, ignoring dominance where applicable. Wait, but dominance applies to the expression of the traits, not the alleles themselves. So even if one allele is dominant, the bird will display the associated phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. Therefore, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering the F1 (CcBb) as the parent. The F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014since both parents are homozygous, the F1 must be CcBb, so the gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each with a 25% chance. Now, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- From cB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- From cB \u00d7 cb: cc BB\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The correct way is to list all possible combinations:\n\nGamete 1: CB\nGamete 2: cb\nGamete 3: cB\nGamete 4: cb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cB \u2192 CcBB? Wait, no\u2014wait, each parent contributes one allele. So, for the B gene, CB and cb\u2014so the F2 genotypes for B would be BB, Bb, Bb, bb, etc.? Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (homozygous red)\n- 50% CcBb (heterozygous)\n- 25% cc bb (homozygous plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct because the F2 is derived from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. So each F2 individual inherits two alleles from each parent. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% CcBb (from CB + cb or cb + CB)\n- 25% cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- 25% ccBb (Wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, then the F2 could have ccBb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm getting confused. Let me use a standard Punnett square approach for dihybrid cross.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. Selfing:\n\n- The F2 will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\n  - 25% CC (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n  - 25% Cc (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n  - 25% cc (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n  - 25% BB (from Bb \u00d7 Bb)\n  - 25% Bb (from Bb \u00d7 Bb)\n  - 25% bb (from Bb \u00d7 Bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s for monohybrid crosses. For dihybrids, the calculation is more complex. The correct approach is to multiply the probabilities for each gene. Since both genes are independent, the probability for each combination is (probability for C) \u00d7 (probability for B). \n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: 25% C (red), 75% c (plain)\n- B: 25% B (brown), 75% b (checkered)\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 25% C \u00d7 25% B \u2192 6.25% (but scaled up to percentages)\n2. C_bb \u2192 25% C \u00d7 75% b \u2192 18.75%?\nWait, no, that's incorrect because it's a dihybrid cross. Let me properly calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the F2:\n\n- CC BB: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: (25%) \u00d7 (75%) = 18.75%\n- CC bb: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n- Cc Bb: (25%) \u00d7 (75%) = 18.75%\n- Cc bb: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n- cc BB: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: (25%) \u00d7 (75%) = 18.75%\n- cc bb: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each gene is independent. Actually, for each of the four phenotypes, the probability is calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_B_ \u2192 (Probability C) \u00d7 (Probability B) = 0.25 \u00d7 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n- Phenotype 2: C_bb \u2192 0.25 \u00d7 0.75 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n- Phenotype 3: cc_B_ \u2192 0.75 \u00d7 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n- Phenotype 4: cc_bb \u2192 0.75 \u00d7 0.75 = 0.5625 (56.25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the F2 is not a simple dihybrid cross. Each parent is CcBb, so the F2 genotypes are as above. However, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Let's recalculate the phenotypic distribution correctly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotypic ratio depends on how many of the F2 genotypes include at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nAlternatively, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the possible combinations:\n\n- Both C and B are present (C_B_): 25% (phenotype 1)\n- C present, B absent (C_bb): 25% (phenotype 2)\n- c present, B present (cc_B_): 25% (phenotype 3)\n- c present, B absent (cc_bb): 25% (phenotype 4)\n\nBut wait, this assumes that dominance does not override the phenotype, which is correct. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 25% for each of the four phenotypes, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer options reflect this. Instead, the options suggest grouping phenotypes into two checkered and two plain colors.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nThis suggests that checkered red and checkered brown are considered one category, and similarly for plain. This might mean that the phenotype is categorized based on whether the bird is checkered or plain, regardless of the color. Similarly, red or brown is considered another category.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered (both c and b): includes checkered red and checkered brown \u2192 12% (from 25% each)\n- Plain (both C and B): includes plain red and plain brown \u2192 25% (from 12.5% each)\n- Wait, but according to the previous calculations, each phenotype is 25%, so if we group checkered and plain together, it would be 50%.\n\nHowever, the options don't align perfectly. Let me recount the percentages:\n\nIf each phenotype is 25%, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nBut none of the options sum to 100%. Option J sums to 2+6+3+1=12, which is less than 100. Option G sums to 12+2+2+0=16. Option D sums to 1+3+9+3=16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me reconsider the definition of \"checkered.\" If a bird is classified as checkered if it has at least one recessive allele for B, then:\n\n- Checkered: cc_B_ (both c and B recessive)\n- Plain: CC BB or CC bb or cc BB or cc bb?\n\nWait, no\u2014checkered would be any bird with at least one recessive allele for B. So:\n\n- Checkered: cc_B_ (regardless of C)\n- Plain: CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, cc bb.\n\nThus, the phenotypic groups would be:\n\n1. Checkered (all with at least one recessive B): cc_B_\n2. Plain (all without recessive B): CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, cc bb.\n\nWithin these, the presence of dominant C affects the color:\n\n- Checkered red: cc_B_ and C_B_ \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: cc_b (only) \u2192 25%\n- Plain red: CC BB, CC bb \u2192 50%\n- Plain brown: cc BB, cc bb \u2192 50%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because within the checkered group (cc_B_), the presence of dominant C determines the color. So:\n\n- Checkered red: cc_B_ and C_B_ \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: cc_b \u2192 25%\n\nSimilarly, for plain:\n\n- Plain red: CC BB, CC bb \u2192 50%\n- Plain brown: cc BB, cc bb \u2192 50%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio becomes:\n\n- Checkered red: 50%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 50%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nThis still doesn't align with the answer options. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 20%\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 16%\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 16%\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16%\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16%\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16%\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16%\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 16%\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16%\nOption J: checkered red",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant and B recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c and B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c and B recessive)\n\nNow, the probability for each phenotype depends on the genetic makeup of the parents. Since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will follow a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio. Wait, no\u2014that's the case when both parents are heterozygous. Here, the parents are homozygous, so the F2 will have different ratios.\n\nWait, let me clarify. When both parents are homozygous (for example, CC and cc), their F1 will all be Cc, and then the F2 will follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio, except that the actual phenotypic ratio depends on whether the traits are codominant or additive. In this case, both traits are codominant, so the F2 phenotypic ratio will be 1:1:1:1, but adjusted for dominance. However, in our case, since both parents are homozygous, the F2 will have specific phenotypes based on the combination of C and B alleles.\n\nSo let's compute the probabilities:\n\nEach bird will express the phenotype based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene. The possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Both C and B are dominant (C_B_), which results in red and brown.\n2. C dominant, B recessive (C_bb), which results in red and checkered.\n3. c dominant, B dominant (cc_B_), which results in plain and brown.\n4. Both c and b (cc_bb), which results in plain and checkered.\n\nThe probability for each phenotype is calculated based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nSince both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), their F2 will inherit one allele from each parent for each gene. Let's consider each gene separately and then combine them.\n\nFor Gene C (pigment):\n\n- Parent 1 (CC) contributes C always.\n- Parent 2 (cc) contributes c always.\n- Therefore, F2 for C: 50% C (red), 50% c (plain).\n\nFor Gene B (color):\n\n- Parent 1 (BB) contributes B always.\n- Parent 2 (bb) contributes b always.\n- Therefore, F2 for B: 50% B (brown), 50% b (checkered).\n\nAssuming independence between genes, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. Therefore, the overall F2 phenotypic ratio is:\n\nPhenotype 1: C_B_ = (C)(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\nPhenotype 2: C_bb = (C)(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\nPhenotype 3: cc_B_ = (c)(B) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\nPhenotype 4: cc_bb = (c)(b) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 25%\n\nBut wait, that's 100%, but the way the options are given, they seem to expect four phenotypes with counts. So the expected phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but looking back at the options, none of them exactly say that. Instead, some options group them into checkered red, checkered brown, plain red, plain brown.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting us to categorize based on the combination of pigmentation and body color, rather than each gene alone. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't 1:1:1:1 due to the dominance relationships. Let me double-check. If both parents are homozygous (CC BB and cc bb), the F1 will all be CcBb. Then, the F2 will be CcBb selfing. So, the F2 will have four possible genotypes: CC (25%), Cc (50%), and bb (25%). Wait, no\u2014it's four phenotypic classes based on the presence of dominant alleles for both genes.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering each gene separately and then combining them. Let's do that.\n\nFor the C locus:\n\n- C is dominant: red\n- c is recessive: plain\n\nThe F2 for C will be:\n\n- 50% C (red)\n- 50% c (plain)\n\nSimilarly, for the B locus:\n\n- B is dominant: brown\n- b is recessive: checkered\n\nF2 for B will be:\n\n- 50% B (brown)\n- 50% b (checkered)\n\nAssuming independence, the combined phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_: (Red and Brown)\n2. C_bb: (Red and Checkered)\n3. cc_B_: (Plain and Brown)\n4. cc_bb: (Plain and Checkered)\n\nEach of these has a 25% chance, leading to a phenotypic ratio of 1:1:1:1. But the options don't reflect that directly. Looking at the options, option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. That seems off. Option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 0. That also doesn't fit. Option J says checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the dominance hierarchy. Maybe the presence of at least one dominant allele for either gene leads to a particular phenotype, overriding the others. Alternatively, perhaps the phenotypes are grouped differently. Let me re-examine the question.\n\nWait, the question asks for the phenotypic ratio after F2. Let me calculate the number of each phenotype in the F2.\n\nIn F2, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (C_B_)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C_bb)\n3. Plain and brown (cc_B_)\n4. Plain and checkered (cc_bb)\n\nEach has a 25% chance, so in a population of N individuals, each phenotype occurs N/4 times. But the answer choices suggest grouping into two checkered and two plain colors. Perhaps the question is asking for the proportion within each class, regardless of the order. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to count the number of each type without considering dominance beyond what's stated.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to recognize that each gene is controlled by a separate pair of loci, and thus the phenotypes are determined by the combination of both traits. However, without dominance overrides, each combination is distinct. But given that the options provided don't match a 1:1:1:1 ratio, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore dominance and simply count the number of each phenotype based on the possible combinations of alleles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the actual phenotypes based on the presence of dominant alleles for each gene, ignoring dominance where applicable. Wait, but dominance applies to the expression of the traits, not the alleles themselves. So even if one allele is dominant, the bird will display the associated phenotype.\n\nGiven that, the F2 phenotypic ratio would indeed be 1:1:1:1, but none of the options reflect that. Therefore, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me construct a Punnett square for the F2 generation, considering the F1 (CcBb) as the parent. The F1 can produce four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no\u2014since both parents are homozygous, the F1 must be CcBb, so the gametes would be CB and cb, each at 50%.\n\nTherefore, the F2 will have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb, each with a 25% chance. Now, the F2 genotypes will be:\n\n- From CB \u00d7 CB: CC BB\n- From CB \u00d7 cb: CcBb\n- From cB \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- From cB \u00d7 cb: cc BB\n- From cb \u00d7 CB: CcBb\n- From cb \u00d7 cb: cc bb\n\nWait, no, that's not accurate. The correct way is to list all possible combinations:\n\nGamete 1: CB\nGamete 2: cb\nGamete 3: cB\nGamete 4: cb\n\nSo the F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CB + CB \u2192 CC BB\n- CB + cb \u2192 CcBb\n- CB + cB \u2192 CcBB? Wait, no\u2014wait, each parent contributes one allele. So, for the B gene, CB and cb\u2014so the F2 genotypes for B would be BB, Bb, Bb, bb, etc.? Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (homozygous red)\n- 50% CcBb (heterozygous)\n- 25% cc bb (homozygous plain)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct because the F2 is derived from the F1 (CcBb) selfing. So each F2 individual inherits two alleles from each parent. So the F2 will have the following genotypes:\n\n- 25% CC BB (from CB + CB)\n- 25% CcBb (from CB + cb or cb + CB)\n- 25% cc BB (from cb + cb)\n- 25% ccBb (Wait, no\u2014if both parents are CcBb, then the F2 could have ccBb?)\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm getting confused. Let me use a standard Punnett square approach for dihybrid cross.\n\nThe F1 is CcBb. Selfing:\n\n- The F2 will have the following genotypic ratios:\n\n  - 25% CC (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n  - 25% Cc (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n  - 25% cc (from Cc \u00d7 Cc)\n  - 25% BB (from Bb \u00d7 Bb)\n  - 25% Bb (from Bb \u00d7 Bb)\n  - 25% bb (from Bb \u00d7 Bb)\n\nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s for monohybrid crosses. For dihybrids, the calculation is more complex. The correct approach is to multiply the probabilities for each gene. Since both genes are independent, the probability for each combination is (probability for C) \u00d7 (probability for B). \n\nFor each gene:\n\n- C: 25% C (red), 75% c (plain)\n- B: 25% B (brown), 75% b (checkered)\n\nThus, the four possible phenotypes are:\n\n1. C_B_ \u2192 25% C \u00d7 25% B \u2192 6.25% (but scaled up to percentages)\n2. C_bb \u2192 25% C \u00d7 75% b \u2192 18.75%?\nWait, no, that's incorrect because it's a dihybrid cross. Let me properly calculate the probabilities:\n\nFor the F2:\n\n- CC BB: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n- CC Bb: (25%) \u00d7 (75%) = 18.75%\n- CC bb: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n- Cc BB: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n- Cc Bb: (25%) \u00d7 (75%) = 18.75%\n- Cc bb: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n- cc BB: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n- cc Bb: (25%) \u00d7 (75%) = 18.75%\n- cc bb: (25%) \u00d7 (25%) = 6.25%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because each gene is independent. Actually, for each of the four phenotypes, the probability is calculated as follows:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_B_ \u2192 (Probability C) \u00d7 (Probability B) = 0.25 \u00d7 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n- Phenotype 2: C_bb \u2192 0.25 \u00d7 0.75 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n- Phenotype 3: cc_B_ \u2192 0.75 \u00d7 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n- Phenotype 4: cc_bb \u2192 0.75 \u00d7 0.75 = 0.5625 (56.25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014that's incorrect because the F2 is not a simple dihybrid cross. Each parent is CcBb, so the F2 genotypes are as above. However, the phenotypes are determined by the presence of dominant alleles. Let's recalculate the phenotypic distribution correctly.\n\nEach bird has two alleles for each gene. The phenotypic ratio depends on how many of the F2 genotypes include at least one dominant allele for each gene.\n\nAlternatively, the phenotypic ratio can be found by considering the possible combinations:\n\n- Both C and B are present (C_B_): 25% (phenotype 1)\n- C present, B absent (C_bb): 25% (phenotype 2)\n- c present, B present (cc_B_): 25% (phenotype 3)\n- c present, B absent (cc_bb): 25% (phenotype 4)\n\nBut wait, this assumes that dominance does not override the phenotype, which is correct. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 25% for each of the four phenotypes, leading to a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, none of the answer options reflect this. Instead, the options suggest grouping phenotypes into two checkered and two plain colors.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption J: checkered red 2, checkered brown 6, plain red 3, plain brown 1\n\nThis suggests that checkered red and checkered brown are considered one category, and similarly for plain. This might mean that the phenotype is categorized based on whether the bird is checkered or plain, regardless of the color. Similarly, red or brown is considered another category.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n- Checkered (both c and b): includes checkered red and checkered brown \u2192 12% (from 25% each)\n- Plain (both C and B): includes plain red and plain brown \u2192 25% (from 12.5% each)\n- Wait, but according to the previous calculations, each phenotype is 25%, so if we group checkered and plain together, it would be 50%.\n\nHowever, the options don't align perfectly. Let me recount the percentages:\n\nIf each phenotype is 25%, then:\n\n- Checkered red: 25%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 25%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nBut none of the options sum to 100%. Option J sums to 2+6+3+1=12, which is less than 100. Option G sums to 12+2+2+0=16. Option D sums to 1+3+9+3=16.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me reconsider the definition of \"checkered.\" If a bird is classified as checkered if it has at least one recessive allele for B, then:\n\n- Checkered: cc_B_ (both c and B recessive)\n- Plain: CC BB or CC bb or cc BB or cc bb?\n\nWait, no\u2014checkered would be any bird with at least one recessive allele for B. So:\n\n- Checkered: cc_B_ (regardless of C)\n- Plain: CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, cc bb.\n\nThus, the phenotypic groups would be:\n\n1. Checkered (all with at least one recessive B): cc_B_\n2. Plain (all without recessive B): CC BB, CC bb, cc BB, cc bb.\n\nWithin these, the presence of dominant C affects the color:\n\n- Checkered red: cc_B_ and C_B_ \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: cc_b (only) \u2192 25%\n- Plain red: CC BB, CC bb \u2192 50%\n- Plain brown: cc BB, cc bb \u2192 50%\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not right. Because within the checkered group (cc_B_), the presence of dominant C determines the color. So:\n\n- Checkered red: cc_B_ and C_B_ \u2192 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Checkered brown: cc_b \u2192 25%\n\nSimilarly, for plain:\n\n- Plain red: CC BB, CC bb \u2192 50%\n- Plain brown: cc BB, cc bb \u2192 50%\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio becomes:\n\n- Checkered red: 50%\n- Checkered brown: 25%\n- Plain red: 50%\n- Plain brown: 25%\n\nThis still doesn't align with the answer options. Let me look again at the options:\n\nOption A: checkered red 6, checkered brown 2, plain 6, plain brown 2 \u2192 20%\nOption B: checkered red 8, checkered brown 4, plain 0, plain brown 4 \u2192 16%\nOption C: checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain 3, plain brown 1 \u2192 16%\nOption D: checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain 9, plain brown 3 \u2192 16%\nOption E: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16%\nOption F: checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain 4, plain brown 4 \u2192 16%\nOption G: checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain 2, plain brown 0 \u2192 16%\nOption H: checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain 2, plain brown 6 \u2192 16%\nOption I: checkered red 7, checkered brown 5, plain 1, plain brown 3 \u2192 16%\nOption J: checkered red",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",

    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut how many of these occur? Let's see:\n\n- If the bird is Cc (for pigment) and Bb (for color):\n   - Pigment: red (C dominant)\n   - Color: brown (B dominant)\n- If Cc and bb:\n   - Pigment: red\n   - Color: checkered (since b is recessive)\n- If cc and Bb:\n   - Pigment: plain\n   - Color: brown\n- If cc and bb:\n   - Pigment: plain\n   - Color: checkered\n\nSo now, considering the F2 generation, what are the probabilities for each phenotype?\n\nFirst, calculate the probability for each combination of C and B.\n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n\n- In F2, the probability of having pigment (C) is 3/4 (since CC and Cc are present), and plain (cc) is 1/4.\n\nFor color (B/b):\n\n- Similarly, brown (B) is 3/4, checkered (b) is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative.

Plain (cc) AND Brown (B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain (cc) AND Checkered (b): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, convert these fractions to ratios: 9:3:3:1. Adding them up gives 16 parts, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That doesn't match our calculation. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that seems off too. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching. Option J suggests 2,6,3,1. Option A is 6,2,2,6\u2014which also isn't matching. Option E suggests 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, but the order is different. Our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E if ordered as checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). Wait, but in our case, checkered red is the same as the 'red' phenotype, which would include both Pigmented red and Pigmented plain. Wait, hold on. Maybe I got confused earlier. Let me clarify the phenotypes again.\n\nThe bird's phenotype depends on both genes. For example, if a bird is Cc (pigmented) and Bb (color), it's Pigmented red and Brown. If it's Cc and bb, it's Pigmented red and Checkered. If it's cc and Bb, it's Plain red and Brown. If it's cc and bb, it's Plain red and Checkered.\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and Brown\n2. Pigmented red and Checkered\n3. Plain red and Brown\n4. Plain red and Checkered\n\nEach has a probability of 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16 respectively.\n\nLooking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that might be reversed. Because checkered red includes both Pigmented red and Plain red. From the probabilities, Pigmented red is 9/16, Plain red is 3/16. Similarly, Pigmented brown is 3/16, Plain brown is 1/16.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, Pigmented red is 9/16, Pigmented brown is 3/16, Plain red is 3/16, and Plain brown is 1/16. So the correct order is:\n\n- Pigmented red: 9\n- Pigmented brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nWhich matches option E, where checkered red 3 (which is Plain red), checkered brown 9 (Pigmented brown), plain red 1 (Pigmented red), plain brown 3 (Checkered brown).\n\nWait, but the way the options are written might vary. Looking at the original options, E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Yes, that aligns with our calculation.

Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene.

Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nBut how many of these occur? Let's see:\n\n- If the bird is Cc (for pigment) and Bb (for color):\n   - Pigment: red (C dominant)\n   - Color: brown (B dominant)\n- If Cc and bb:\n   - Pigment: red\n   - Color: checkered (since b is recessive)\n- If cc and Bb:\n   - Pigment: plain\n   - Color: brown\n- If cc and bb:\n   - Pigment: plain\n   - Color: checkered\n\nSo now, considering the F2 generation, what are the probabilities for each phenotype?\n\nFirst, calculate the probability for each combination of C and B.\n\nFor pigment (C/c):\n\n- In F2, the probability of having pigment (C) is 3/4 (since CC and Cc are present), and plain (cc) is 1/4.\n\nFor color (B/b):\n\n- Similarly, brown (B) is 3/4, checkered (b) is 1/4.\n\nSince the genes are independent, the combined probabilities are multiplicative. So the four possible phenotypic combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C) AND Brown (B): (3/4)(3/4) = 9/16\n2. Pigment red (C) AND Checkered (b): (3/4)(1/4) = 3/16\n3. Plain (cc) AND Brown (B): (1/4)(3/4) = 3/16\n4. Plain (cc) AND Checkered (b): (1/4)(1/4) = 1/16\n\nNow, convert these fractions to ratios: 9:3:3:1. Adding them up gives 16 parts, so the ratio is 9:3:3:1.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option G says checkered red 12, checkered brown 2, plain red 2, plain brown 2. That doesn't match our calculation. Option D says checkered red 1, checkered brown 3, plain red 9, plain brown 3. Hmm, that seems off too. Option H says checkered red 5, checkered brown 3, plain red 2, plain brown 6. Also not matching. Option J suggests 2,6,3,1. Option A is 6,2,2,6\u2014which also isn't matching. Option E suggests 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16, but the order is different. Our calculation shows 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to option E if ordered as checkered red (9), checkered brown (3), plain red (3), plain brown (1). Wait, but in our case, checkered red is the same as the 'red' phenotype, which would include both Pigmented red and Pigmented plain. Wait, hold on. Maybe I got confused earlier. Let me clarify the phenotypes again.\n\nThe bird's phenotype depends on both genes. For example, if a bird is Cc (pigmented) and Bb (color), it's Pigmented red and Brown. If it's Cc and bb, it's Pigmented red and Checkered. If it's cc and Bb, it's Plain red and Brown. If it's cc and bb, it's Plain red and Checkered.\n\nSo the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigmented red and Brown\n2. Pigmented red and Checkered\n3. Plain red and Brown\n4. Plain red and Checkered\n\nEach has a probability of 9/16, 3/16, 3/16, 1/16 respectively.\n\nLooking at the options, option E says checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. Wait, that might be reversed. Because checkered red includes both Pigmented red and Plain red. From the probabilities, Pigmented red is 9/16, Plain red is 3/16. Similarly, Pigmented brown is 3/16, Plain brown is 1/16.\n\nWait, but according to our calculations, Pigmented red is 9/16, Pigmented brown is 3/16, Plain red is 3/16, and Plain brown is 1/16. So the correct order is:\n\n- Pigmented red: 9\n- Pigmented brown: 3\n- Plain red: 3\n- Plain brown: 1\n\nWhich matches option E, where checkered red 3 (which is Plain red), checkered brown 9 (Pigmented brown), plain red 1 (Pigmented red), plain brown 3 (Checkered brown).\n\nWait, but the way the options are written might vary. Looking at the original options, E says \"checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3.\" Yes, that aligns with our calculation. So the correct answer should be E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, since the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive), the F1 will all be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. In the F1, the probability of having each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. For pigment color (C/c): in F1 (Cc), the possible phenotypes are 50% C (red) and 50% c (plain). Similarly, for body color (B/b): in F1 (Bb), the possible phenotypes are 50% B (brown) and 50% b (checkered).\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red and Brown body = (50% C) * (50% B) = 25%\n- Pigment red and Checkered body = (50% C) * (50% b) = 25%\n- Plain pigment and Brown body = (50% c) * (50% B) = 25%\n- Plain pigment and Checkered body = (50% c) * (50% b) = 25%\n\nWait, but the F1 is CcBb, so the phenotypic breakdown would be:\n\nEach bird has two traits, so the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo each of these four phenotypes would occur at 25% frequency, making a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, but the options provided don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me look at them again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\n\nWait, option F is 4,4,4,4, which would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But according to my calculations, it's also a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, looking at the options, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. That doesn't align with our expectation. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't all F1 selfing, but rather considering the cross between F1 and another F1? Wait, no\u2014the question says the adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the parents are (CC BB) and (cc bb), which are both homozygous. Their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would come from F1 selfing. So the F2 should follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Option K is the same as F: 4,4,4,4, which seems off because each bird has two traits. Wait, but the options might represent the count of each phenotype, not the ratio. If each phenotype accounts for 4 birds, then the counts add up to 16 (since each F2 bird is considered individually, but in reality, the number would be 16 birds in F2). So 4 each would make sense if each phenotype is equally represented. But according to the user's options, some have 1,3,9,3 which adds to 16. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the F1 phenotypes instead of the F2. Let me re-examine the question: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" It says adihybrid cross, which typically refers to crossed with a bird that has the recessive phenotype. So the cross is Homozygous dominant (CC BB) x Heterozygous (CcBb) or something else? Wait, no\u2014the user wrote the cross as Homozygous dominant (CC BB) \u00d7 Heterozygous (cc bb)? Because the child is a plain brown bird, which is cc bb. So the cross is Homozygous dominant (CC BB) \u00d7 Heterozygous (CcBb). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the squares of CcBb. So the Punnett square for F2 would indeed be 16 birds, and the phenotypes would be fourfold equally likely, i.e., 4 each. So the answer would reflect 4,4,4,4. Looking at the options, option K says \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which matches 4 each. But the options labeled A-K go from 1,2,3,4 etc. So option K is 4,4,4,4. But the initial options didn't have that. Wait, reviewing the user's options: E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio. How could that happen?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents aren't both homozygous. Wait, the cross is Homozygous checkered red (CC BB) \u00d7 Heterozygous plain brown (Cc bb)? No, because the child is a plain brown bird, which is cc bb. So the cross is Homozygous dominant (CC BB) \u00d7 Heterozygous (CcBb), producing F1 as CcBb, and F2 as 16 birds. Then, in F2, the phenotypes would be 1:1:1:1, as each gene is independently assorting. So 4 each. But among the options, none directly say 4:4:4:4. The closest is option J: 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Option G: 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and intended the F1 phenotypes instead of F2. But the question clearly states F2. Another possibility is that the user is referring to the phenotypic ratio of each trait separately, not combined. For example, counting how many have red, how many have brown, etc., regardless of the other trait. Let's calculate that approach. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes. So each bird contributes to two categories. For example, a bird could have Pigment red and Brown body (Phenotype 1), Pigment red and Checkered body (Phenotype 2), Pigment plain and Brown body (Phenotype 3), or Pigment plain and Checkered body (Phenotype 4). So for each bird, we have one phenotype, but counted twice. To get the total count for each category, we'd sum all birds in each phenotype. Let's see the F2 generation. From the Punnett square of CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut for the phenotype, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So:\n\n- CC (pigment red, plain body): Phenotype 1\n- Cc (pigment red, checkered body): Phenotype 2\n- cc (pigment plain, brown body): Phenotype 3\n- bb (pigment plain, checkered body): Phenotype 4\n\nNow, for each of these genotypes, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, so each phenotype would have 25% of the F2 population. Assuming a large enough population, each phenotype would have approximately 4 birds (assuming 16 birds). But looking at the options, none have 4 each. The closest is option K: 4,4,4,4. But I think the actual F2 ratio is 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype, leading to 4 each if 16 birds. So perhaps the intended answer is 4 each. However, the options provided do not include this exact phrasing. Alternatively, perhaps the user miscounted the options. Looking back, the user listed the options as follows:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis sums to 16. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each bird has two traits, so each bird would contribute to two categories. Wait, but the user lists the counts as 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. This implies that each phenotype was counted as the sum across the two traits. So, for example, 3 birds have Pigment red and Brown body, 9 have Pigment red and Checkered, etc. But according to our earlier analysis, each phenotype should occur 4 times. So why does option E have different numbers?\n\nLet me recalculate. From the Punnett square, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Pigment red, Plain body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc (25%) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nAssuming equal distribution, each phenotype would have 1/4 of the F2 population. If the F2 population is 16 birds, then each phenotype would have 4 birds. But none of the options list 4 each. However, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. So perhaps the user meant F1 phenotypes instead of F2. If the cross is Homozygous dominant (CC BB) \u00d7 Heterozygous (CcBb), then the F1 is CcBb, and the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\nFor pigment: 50% C (red), 50% c (plain)\n\nFor color: 50% B (brown), 50% b (checkered)\n\nCombining these, each F1 bird would have four possible phenotypes, each occurring at 25% probability. Thus, in a sample of 16 F1 birds, each phenotype would appear 4 times. Again, none of the options match this exactly. However, option E has different counts: 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. Perhaps the user miscalculated the phenotypic ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, not F2. If that's the case, then each F1 bird has four phenotypes, each at 25%, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not one of the options either. Alternatively, maybe the user confused the F1 and F2 ratios.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the user is considering only the dominant traits. Let's see. Pigment red is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele would have Pigment red. Color brown is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele would have Brown body. Therefore, the possible phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown body \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red and Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Pigment plain and Brown body \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Pigment plain and Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nFrom the F2 generation, each of these phenotypes would occur 25% of the time. So the ratio would still be 1:1:1:1. But again, none of the options match this exactly.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which sums to 16. This suggests that checkered red (which would be phenotype B) appears 3 times, checkered brown (A) 9, plain red (C) once, and plain brown (D) 3. This doesn't align with the expected 25% for each phenotype. Maybe the user is considering the percentage of each trait without accounting for the other trait. For example, the proportion of birds that have Pigment red versus others. Let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has two traits. The possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown \u2192 25%\n- Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 25%\n- Pigment plain and Brown \u2192 25%\n- Pigment plain and Checkered \u2192 25%\n\nIf the F2 population is 16 birds, then:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment plain and Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment plain and Checkered \u2192 4 birds\n\nThus, each phenotype would have 4 birds. None of the options list this, but option J is 2,6,3,1, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the number of each trait without considering the other. For example, the number of birds with Pigment red (regardless of color) plus the number with Pigment plain (regardless of color). But that would be 12 birds, which is option G. Alternatively, maybe the user is counting the number of birds with Pigment red and the rest. But this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the phenotypic ratio in terms of each trait individually. For instance, the number of birds with Pigment red (regardless of color) plus those with Pigment plain, etc. But that would double-count some birds. For example, a bird with Pigment red and Brown would be counted under both Pigment red and Pigment red and Checkered. This complicates things.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that the correct F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, leading to 4 each bird, which would correspond to option J if it were 2,6,3,1 (summing to 12), but that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2, which would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not an option either. \n\nConsidering all this, the most plausible answer based on the options provided and the reasoning is that the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, so option J (2,6,3,1) doesn't fit, but perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 4:4:4:4, which isn't listed. Given the options, the closest is option J, which sums to 12, but that's inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would be 1:1:1:1, but that's also not an option. \n\nAt this point, I think the correct answer is option J, as it's the only one where the total is 12, which may indicate a different calculation method, such as counting each trait separately without considering the other. However, this is speculative.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c recessive, b recessive)\n\nNow, since the parents are CC BB (homozygous dominant) and cc bb (homozygous recessive), the F1 will all be CcBb, which is heterozygous for both genes. In the F1, the probability of having each phenotype depends on the combination of the two genes. For pigment color (C/c): in F1 (Cc), the possible phenotypes are 50% C (red) and 50% c (plain). Similarly, for body color (B/b): in F1 (Bb), the possible phenotypes are 50% B (brown) and 50% b (checkered).\n\nSince the two genes are independent, the overall probability is the product of the probabilities for each gene. So:\n\n- Probability of Pigment red and Brown body = (50% C) * (50% B) = 25%\n- Pigment red and Checkered body = (50% C) * (50% b) = 25%\n- Plain pigment and Brown body = (50% c) * (50% B) = 25%\n- Plain pigment and Checkered body = (50% c) * (50% b) = 25%\n\nWait, but the F1 is CcBb, so the phenotypic breakdown would be:\n\nEach bird has two traits, so the four possible combinations are:\n\n1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (if C dominant, b recessive)\n3. Pigment plain and brown (if c recessive, B dominant)\n4. Pigment plain and checkered (if c recessive, b recessive)\n\nSo each of these four phenotypes would occur at 25% frequency, making a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, looking back at the options given, none seem to match exactly. Wait, but the options provided don't include a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Let me look at them again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. 6, 2, 6, 2 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nB. 8,4,0,4 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nI. 7,5,1,3 \u2192 sum to 16\n\nJ. 2,6,3,1 \u2192 sum to 12\n\nK. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 same as F.\n\nWait, option F is 4,4,4,4, which would imply a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But according to my calculations, it's also a 1:1:1:1 ratio. However, looking at the options, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. That doesn't align with our expectation. Maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the F2 generation isn't all F1 selfing, but rather considering the cross between F1 and another F1? Wait, no\u2014the question says the adihybrid cross involving a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB) and a plain brown bird (cc bb). So the parents are (CC BB) and (cc bb), which are both homozygous. Their F1 would be CcBb, and then F2 would come from F1 selfing. So the F2 should follow a 1:1:1:1 ratio. But looking at the options, none directly say 1:1:1:1. Option K is the same as F: 4,4,4,4, which seems off because each bird has two traits. Wait, but the options might represent the count of each phenotype, not the ratio. If each phenotype accounts for 4 birds, then the counts add up to 16 (since each F2 bird is considered individually, but in reality, the number would be 16 birds in F2). So 4 each would make sense if each phenotype is equally represented. But according to the user's options, some have 1,3,9,3 which adds to 16. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the F1 phenotypes instead of the F2. Let me re-examine the question: \"Complete a Punnett square for adihybridcross involving a homozygous checkered red bird and a plain brown bird.\" It says adihybrid cross, which typically refers to crossed with a bird that has the recessive phenotype. So the cross is Homozygous dominant (CC BB) x Heterozygous (CcBb) or something else? Wait, no\u2014the user wrote the cross as Homozygous dominant (CC BB) \u00d7 Heterozygous (cc bb)? Because the child is a plain brown bird, which is cc bb. So the cross is Homozygous dominant (CC BB) \u00d7 Heterozygous (CcBb). Then, the F1 would be CcBb, and F2 would be the squares of CcBb. So the Punnett square for F2 would indeed be 16 birds, and the phenotypes would be fourfold equally likely, i.e., 4 each. So the answer would reflect 4,4,4,4. Looking at the options, option K says \"Checkered red 4, checkered brown 4, plain red 4, plain brown 4,\" which matches 4 each. But the options labeled A-K go from 1,2,3,4 etc. So option K is 4,4,4,4. But the initial options didn't have that. Wait, reviewing the user's options: E. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3. That suggests a 3:9:1:3 ratio. How could that happen?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents aren't both homozygous. Wait, the cross is Homozygous checkered red (CC BB) \u00d7 Heterozygous plain brown (Cc bb)? No, because the child is a plain brown bird, which is cc bb. So the cross is Homozygous dominant (CC BB) \u00d7 Heterozygous (CcBb), producing F1 as CcBb, and F2 as 16 birds. Then, in F2, the phenotypes would be 1:1:1:1, as each gene is independently assorting. So 4 each. But among the options, none directly say 4:4:4:4. The closest is option J: 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Option G: 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a typo, and intended the F1 phenotypes instead of F2. But the question clearly states F2. Another possibility is that the user is referring to the phenotypic ratio of each trait separately, not combined. For example, counting how many have red, how many have brown, etc., regardless of the other trait. Let's calculate that approach. For each bird, the phenotype is determined by both genes. So each bird contributes to two categories. For example, a bird could have Pigment red and Brown body (Phenotype 1), Pigment red and Checkered body (Phenotype 2), Pigment plain and Brown body (Phenotype 3), or Pigment plain and Checkered body (Phenotype 4). So for each bird, we have one phenotype, but counted twice. To get the total count for each category, we'd sum all birds in each phenotype. Let's see the F2 generation. From the Punnett square of CcBb \u00d7 CcBb, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb)\n\nBut for the phenotype, each bird's phenotype is determined by both genes. So:\n\n- CC (pigment red, plain body): Phenotype 1\n- Cc (pigment red, checkered body): Phenotype 2\n- cc (pigment plain, brown body): Phenotype 3\n- bb (pigment plain, checkered body): Phenotype 4\n\nNow, for each of these genotypes, the phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, so each phenotype would have 25% of the F2 population. Assuming a large enough population, each phenotype would have approximately 4 birds (assuming 16 birds). But looking at the options, none have 4 each. The closest is option K: 4,4,4,4. But I think the actual F2 ratio is 1:1:1:1 for each phenotype, leading to 4 each if 16 birds. So perhaps the intended answer is 4 each. However, the options provided do not include this exact phrasing. Alternatively, perhaps the user miscounted the options. Looking back, the user listed the options as follows:\n\nE. Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3\n\nThis sums to 16. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each bird has two traits, so each bird would contribute to two categories. Wait, but the user lists the counts as 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. This implies that each phenotype was counted as the sum across the two traits. So, for example, 3 birds have Pigment red and Brown body, 9 have Pigment red and Checkered, etc. But according to our earlier analysis, each phenotype should occur 4 times. So why does option E have different numbers?\n\nLet me recalculate. From the Punnett square, the possible F2 genotypes are:\n\n- CC (25%) \u2192 Pigment red, Plain body \u2192 Phenotype 1\n- Cc (25%) \u2192 Pigment red, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 2\n- cc (25%) \u2192 Pigment plain, Brown body \u2192 Phenotype 3\n- bb (25%) \u2192 Pigment plain, Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nAssuming equal distribution, each phenotype would have 1/4 of the F2 population. If the F2 population is 16 birds, then each phenotype would have 4 birds. But none of the options list 4 each. However, option J is 2,6,3,1, which sums to 12. Option G is 12,2,2,0, which sums to 16. So perhaps the user meant F1 phenotypes instead of F2. If the cross is Homozygous dominant (CC BB) \u00d7 Heterozygous (CcBb), then the F1 is CcBb, and the F1 phenotypes would be:\n\nFor pigment: 50% C (red), 50% c (plain)\n\nFor color: 50% B (brown), 50% b (checkered)\n\nCombining these, each F1 bird would have four possible phenotypes, each occurring at 25% probability. Thus, in a sample of 16 F1 birds, each phenotype would appear 4 times. Again, none of the options match this exactly. However, option E has different counts: 3,9,1,3, which sums to 16. Perhaps the user miscalculated the phenotypic ratios. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the F1 phenotypic ratio, not F2. If that's the case, then each F1 bird has four phenotypes, each at 25%, so the ratio would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not one of the options either. Alternatively, maybe the user confused the F1 and F2 ratios.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the user is considering only the dominant traits. Let's see. Pigment red is dominant, so any bird with at least one C allele would have Pigment red. Color brown is dominant, so any bird with at least one B allele would have Brown body. Therefore, the possible phenotypes would be:\n\n1. Pigment red and Brown body \u2192 Phenotype A\n2. Pigment red and Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype B\n3. Pigment plain and Brown body \u2192 Phenotype C\n4. Pigment plain and Checkered body \u2192 Phenotype D\n\nFrom the F2 generation, each of these phenotypes would occur 25% of the time. So the ratio would still be 1:1:1:1. But again, none of the options match this exactly.\n\nLooking back at the options, option E is Phenotypic ratio: checkered red 3, checkered brown 9, plain red 1, plain brown 3, which sums to 16. This suggests that checkered red (which would be phenotype B) appears 3 times, checkered brown (A) 9, plain red (C) once, and plain brown (D) 3. This doesn't align with the expected 25% for each phenotype. Maybe the user is considering the percentage of each trait without accounting for the other trait. For example, the proportion of birds that have Pigment red versus others. Let's compute the number of each phenotype:\n\nIn the F2 generation, each bird has two traits. The possible combinations are:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown \u2192 25%\n- Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 25%\n- Pigment plain and Brown \u2192 25%\n- Pigment plain and Checkered \u2192 25%\n\nIf the F2 population is 16 birds, then:\n\n- Pigment red and Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment red and Checkered \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment plain and Brown \u2192 4 birds\n- Pigment plain and Checkered \u2192 4 birds\n\nThus, each phenotype would have 4 birds. None of the options list this, but option J is 2,6,3,1, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the user wants the number of each trait without considering the other. For example, the number of birds with Pigment red (regardless of color) plus the number with Pigment plain (regardless of color). But that would be 12 birds, which is option G. Alternatively, maybe the user is counting the number of birds with Pigment red and the rest. But this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is considering the phenotypic ratio in terms of each trait individually. For instance, the number of birds with Pigment red (regardless of color) plus those with Pigment plain, etc. But that would double-count some birds. For example, a bird with Pigment red and Brown would be counted under both Pigment red and Pigment red and Checkered. This complicates things.\n\nGiven the confusion, I think the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that the correct F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, leading to 4 each bird, which would correspond to option J if it were 2,6,3,1 (summing to 12), but that doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 phenotypic ratio instead of F2, which would be 1:1:1:1, but that's not an option either. \n\nConsidering all this, the most plausible answer based on the options provided and the reasoning is that the F2 phenotypic ratio is 1:1:1:1, so option J (2,6,3,1) doesn't fit, but perhaps the user made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct ratio is 4:4:4:4, which isn't listed. Given the options, the closest is option J, which sums to 12, but that's inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the F1 phenotypic ratio, which would be 1:1:1:1, but that's also not an option. \n\nAt this point, I think the correct answer is option J, as it's the only one where the total is 12, which may indicate a different calculation method, such as counting each trait separately without considering the other. However, this is speculative.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2.",
    "chunk_resampled": "Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3.",
    "rollout": " Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The actual phenotypes depend on whether the dominant allele is present. So:\n\n- Pigment: If C is present (C_), then red; else, plain.\n- Body color: If B is present (B_), then brown; else, checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these two traits. Since each trait is determined by one gene, and the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let's calculate them step by step.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each pigment and body color.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Probability of C_: 25% (since C/C: 25%, C/c: 50%, c/c: 25%). Wait, no\u2014if the bird is Cc, then the chance of C_ is 3/4 (since CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, cc is 25%), so C_ is 75% (3/4), and c_ is 25%.\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- Probability of B_: 25% (bb: 25%, Bb: 50%, BB: 25%) \u2192 B_ is 75%, b_ is 25%.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are combinations where each trait can be either dominant or recessive. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_): Both dominant \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C_) and Checkered (b_): C_ is present, b_ is absent \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c_) and Brown (B_): c_ is absent, B_ is present \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c_) and Checkered (b_): Both traits are absent \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe phenotypic ratio would then be determined by the product of the probabilities of each trait. Since each trait is independent, the overall probability is:\n\nPhenotype 1: (Probability C_) * (Probability B_) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (75%)\n\nPhenotype 2: (Probability C_) * (Probability b_) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n\nPhenotype 3: (Probability c_) * (Probability B_) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n\nPhenotype 4: (Probability c_) * (Probability b_) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include fractions like 0.5625, so probably the answer expects whole numbers scaled up appropriately. Alternatively, maybe the options represent the ratios without scaling down, implying that each option shows the proportion relative to the total.

Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which sums to 16. Let me verify that.\n\nIf we consider that each bird's phenotype is based on the combination of C and B, then:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_ and B_: 75% of C_ and 75% of B_, so 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Phenotype 2: C_ and b_: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Phenotype 3: c_ and B_: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Phenotype 4: c_ and b_: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nThese add up to 100%. Now, looking at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1.

So option C is showing the phenotypic ratio as 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 56.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 6.25%. This makes sense because the phenotypic ratio for two independent traits each with two alleles is indeed 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me start by reading it carefully. The question is about a dihybrid cross involving two genes controlling animal color and pigmentation. There are two parents: one is a homozygous checkered red bird (CC BB), and the other is a plain brown bird (cc bb). We need to find the phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation using a Punnett square. First, let's break down the information: - Gene C determines pigment color:\n  - C is dominant (red)\n  - c is recessive (plain)\n  \n- Gene B determines color:\n  - B is dominant (brown)\n  - b is recessive (checkered) So, each parent has two alleles for each gene. The first parent is CC BB, meaning both parents have the dominant C and dominant B alleles. The second parent is cc bb, which means both parents have the recessive c and recessive b alleles. Next, we're told that these birds are involved in an adihybrid cross between a homozygous checkered red (CC BB) and a plain brown (cc bb). Then, the offspring will produce gametes and form a Punnett square to predict the F2 generation. Let me outline the steps: 1. Determine the genotype of the parents. - Parent 1: CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n   - Parent 2: cc bb (homozygous recessive) 2. Determine the possible gametes from each parent. - Parent 1 can only give CB because both alleles are dominant. - Parent 2 can only give cb because both alleles are recessive. 3. Create the Punnett square combining these gametes. Wait, but the user provided a detailed set of gametes for the F1, but perhaps they're not necessary here since the question focuses on F2. But maybe the initial setup is correct. Now, the F1 would be all the combinations of CB and cb. Since Parent 1 gives CB and Parent 2 gives cb, the F1 should be CcBb. Then, when F1 self-pollinates (F2), the possible genotypes are: - CC BB (homozygous dominant)\n- CC bb (heterozygous)\n- cc BB (heterozygous)\n- cc bb (homozygous recessive) But wait, no\u2014the parents are CC BB and cc bb, so their F1 would be CcBb, as you correctly mentioned. When F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible gametes are CB, cb, cB, and cb. Wait, no, actually, the correct gametes would be CB, cb, cB, and cb? Or is it just CB and cb? Wait, correction: Each parent produces gametes based on their own alleles. Parent 1 (CC BB) can only produce CB gametes. Parent 2 (cc bb) can only produce cb gametes. So the F1 would be CcBb, and its gametes would be CB and cb. Therefore, F1 \u00d7 F1 would result in four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb? No, wait\u2014each parent can only contribute CB or cb. So F1 (CcBb) can produce CB and cb gametes in equal proportions because the parents are homozygous. So the F2 would have four types of gametes: CB, cb, cB, and cb. But more accurately, the F2 would consist of four possibilities: CC (from CB gamete + CB gamete), Cc (from CB + cb), cc (from cb + cb), and bb (from cb + cb). Wait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think again. The F1 is CcBb. It can produce gametes CB and cb, each at a 50% ratio. So when F1 (CcBb) selfs, the possible F2 genotypes are: - 25% CC (from CB + CB)\n- 25% Cc (from CB + cb)\n- 25% cc (from cb + cb)\n- 25% bb (from cb + cb) Wait, but that's assuming random assortment. However, considering the genes are independent, the probabilities multiply. So yes, each combination occurs at 25%. Therefore, the F2 phenotypes depend on the presence of the dominant alleles for each gene. For the C locus (pigment): - Dominant (C): red\n- Recessive (c): plain For the B locus (color): - Dominant (B): brown\n- Recessive (b): checkered Since both genes are acting independently, the phenotypic ratios can be calculated by multiplying the individual ratios for each gene. Each gene has three possible outcomes (e.g., C is present or not, etc.), but wait, for each gene: - C: presence (red) or absence (plain)\n- B: presence (brown) or absence (checkered) So for each gene, there are two possibilities. Since the genes are independent, the total phenotypic ratios would be 2x2=4 possibilities, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. Wait, but actually, each gene has three phenotypic categories if dominance allows. Wait, no\u2014in this case, it's two traits per bird, but each trait is determined by one gene. So each bird has two traits: pigment color (C/c) and body color (B/b). The possible phenotypes are combinations of these traits. So for each bird, the phenotype can be: 1. Pigment red and brown (if C and B are both dominant)\n2. Pigment red and checkered (C and b)\n3. Plain and brown (c and B)\n4. Plain and checkered (c and b)\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. The actual phenotypes depend on whether the dominant allele is present. So:\n\n- Pigment: If C is present (C_), then red; else, plain.\n- Body color: If B is present (B_), then brown; else, checkered.\n\nSo the possible phenotypes are combinations of these two traits. Since each trait is determined by one gene, and the genes are independent, the phenotypic ratios can be found by multiplying the probabilities of each trait. Let's calculate them step by step.\n\nFirst, determine the probability of each pigment and body color.\n\nFor pigment (C):\n- Probability of C_: 25% (since C/C: 25%, C/c: 50%, c/c: 25%). Wait, no\u2014if the bird is Cc, then the chance of C_ is 3/4 (since CC is 25%, Cc is 50%, cc is 25%), so C_ is 75% (3/4), and c_ is 25%.\n\nSimilarly, for body color (B):\n- Probability of B_: 25% (bb: 25%, Bb: 50%, BB: 25%) \u2192 B_ is 75%, b_ is 25%.\n\nNow, the phenotypes are combinations where each trait can be either dominant or recessive. So the four phenotypes are:\n\n1. Pigment red (C_) and Brown (B_): Both dominant \u2192 Phenotype 1\n2. Pigment red (C_) and Checkered (b_): C_ is present, b_ is absent \u2192 Phenotype 2\n3. Plain (c_) and Brown (B_): c_ is absent, B_ is present \u2192 Phenotype 3\n4. Plain (c_) and Checkered (b_): Both traits are absent \u2192 Phenotype 4\n\nThe phenotypic ratio would then be determined by the product of the probabilities of each trait. Since each trait is independent, the overall probability is:\n\nPhenotype 1: (Probability C_) * (Probability B_) = 0.75 * 0.75 = 0.5625 (75%)\n\nPhenotype 2: (Probability C_) * (Probability b_) = 0.75 * 0.25 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n\nPhenotype 3: (Probability c_) * (Probability B_) = 0.25 * 0.75 = 0.1875 (18.75%)\n\nPhenotype 4: (Probability c_) * (Probability b_) = 0.25 * 0.25 = 0.0625 (6.25%)\n\nBut wait, the options given don't include fractions like 0.5625, so probably the answer expects whole numbers scaled up appropriately. Alternatively, maybe the options represent the ratios without scaling down, implying that each option shows the proportion relative to the total. Let me look back at the options:\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. 6,6,2,2 \u2192 sum 16, which is 1:1:0.125:0.125\n\nB. 8,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 20, which is 0.4:0.2:0.2:0.2\n\nC. 9,3,3,1 \u2192 sum 16, 0.5625:0.1875:0.1875:0.0625\n\nD. 1,3,9,3 \u2192 sum 16, 0.0625:0.1875:0.5625:0.1875\n\nE. 3,9,1,3 \u2192 sum 16, 0.1875:0.5625:0.0625:0.1875\n\nF. 4,4,4,4 \u2192 sum 16, 0.25 each\n\nG. 12,2,2,0 \u2192 sum 16, 0.75:0.125:0.125:0\n\nH. 5,3,2,6 \u2192 sum 16, 0.3125:0.1875:0.125:0.375\n\nWait, none of the options exactly match the 0.5625:0.1875:0.1875:0.0625, except option C. Option C says checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1, which sums to 16. Let me verify that.\n\nIf we consider that each bird's phenotype is based on the combination of C and B, then:\n\n- Phenotype 1: C_ and B_: 75% of C_ and 75% of B_, so 75% * 75% = 56.25%\n- Phenotype 2: C_ and b_: 75% * 25% = 18.75%\n- Phenotype 3: c_ and B_: 25% * 75% = 18.75%\n- Phenotype 4: c_ and b_: 25% * 25% = 6.25%\n\nThese add up to 100%. Now, looking at the options, option C states checkered red 9, checkered brown 3, plain red 3, plain brown 1. Wait, but how does this scale?\n\nAssuming that the total number of birds is 16 (sum of the ratios), then:\n\nCheckered red (Phenotype 1): 9 (out of 16)\nCheckered brown (Phenotype 2): 3\nPlain red (Phenotype 3): 3\nPlain brown (Phenotype 4): 1\n\nAdding up to 16, which matches the sum of the ratios. So option C is showing the phenotypic ratio as 9:3:3:1, which corresponds to 56.25%, 18.75%, 18.75%, and 6.25%. This makes sense because the phenotypic ratio for two independent traits each with two alleles is indeed 9:3:3:1. So the correct answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",
